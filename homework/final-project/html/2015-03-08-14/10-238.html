Candidates who opt to participate, and who ac&para;<br>cept certain campaign restrictions and obligations, are granted an&para;<br>initial outlay of public funds to conduct their campaign. They are&para;<br>also granted additional matching funds if a privately financed candi&para;<br>date’s expenditures, combined with the expenditures of independent&para;<br>groups made in support of the privately financed candidate or in op&para;<br>position to a publicly financed candidate, exceed the publicly financed&para;<br>candidate’s initial state allotment. Once matching funds are trig&para;<br>gered, a publicly financed candidate receives roughly one dollar for&para;<br>every dollar raised or spent by the privately financed candidate—&para;<br>including any money of his own that a privately financed candidate&para;<br>spends on his campaign—and for every dollar spent by independent&para;<br>groups that support the privately financed candidate. When there&para;<br>are multiple publicly financed candidates in a race, each one receives&para;<br>matching funds as a result of the spending of privately financed can&para;<br>didates and independent expenditure groups. Matching funds top&para;<br>out at two times the initial grant to the publicly financed candidate.&para;<br>Petitioners, past and future Arizona candidates and two independ&para;<br>ent expenditure groups that spend money to support and oppose Ari&para;<br>zona candidates, challenged the constitutionality of the matching&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 10–239, McComish et al. v.

BENNETT&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>funds provision, arguing that it unconstitutionally penalizes their&para;<br>speech and burdens their ability to fully exercise their First Amend&para;<br>ment rights. The District Court entered a permanent injunction&para;<br>against the enforcement of the matching funds provision. The Ninth&para;<br>Circuit reversed, concluding that the provision imposed only a mini&para;<br>mal burden and that the burden was justified by Arizona’s interest in&para;<br>reducing quid pro quo political corruption.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Arizona’s matching funds scheme substantially burdens political&para;<br>speech and is not sufficiently justified by a compelling interest to&para;<br>survive First Amendment scrutiny. Pp. 8–30.&para;<br>(a) The matching funds provision imposes a substantial burden on&para;<br>the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expendi&para;<br>ture groups. Pp. 8–22.&para;<br>(1) Petitioners contend that their political speech is substantially&para;<br>burdened in the same way that speech was burdened by the so-called&para;<br>“Millionaire’s Amendment” of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act&para;<br>of 2002, which was invalidated in Davis v. Federal Election Comm’n,&para;<br>554 U. S. 724. That law—which permitted the opponent of a candi&para;<br>date who spent over $350,000 of his personal funds to collect triple&para;<br>the normal contribution amount, while the candidate who spent the&para;<br>personal funds remained subject to the original contribution cap—&para;<br>unconstitutionally forced a candidate “to choose between the First&para;<br>Amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjec&para;<br>tion to discriminatory fundraising limitations.” Id., at 739. This&para;<br>“unprecedented penalty” “impose[d] a substantial burden on the ex&para;<br>ercise of the First Amendment right to use personal funds for cam&para;<br>paign speech” that was not justified by a compelling government in&para;<br>terest. Id., at 739–740. Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(2) The logic of Davis largely controls here. Once a privately fi&para;<br>nanced candidate has raised or spent more than the State’s initial&para;<br>grant to a publicly financed candidate, each personal dollar the pri&para;<br>vately financed candidate spends results in an award of almost one&para;<br>additional dollar to his opponent. The privately financed candidate&para;<br>must “shoulder a special and potentially significant burden” when&para;<br>choosing to exercise his First Amendment right to spend funds on his&para;<br>own candidacy. 554 U. S., at 739. If the law at issue in Davis im&para;<br>posed a burden on candidate speech, the Arizona law unquestionably&para;<br>does so as well.&para;<br>The differences between the matching funds provision and the law&para;<br>struck down in Davis make the Arizona law more constitutionally&para;<br>problematic, not less. First, the penalty in Davis consisted of raising&para;<br>the contribution limits for one candidate, who would still have to&para;<br>raise the additional funds. Here, the direct and automatic release of&para;<br>public money to a publicly financed candidate imposes a far heavier&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>burden. Second, in elections where there are multiple publicly fi&para;<br>nanced candidates—a frequent occurrence in Arizona—the matching&para;<br>funds provision can create a multiplier effect. Each dollar spent by&para;<br>the privately funded candidate results in an additional dollar of fund&para;<br>ing to each of that candidate’s publicly financed opponents. Third,&para;<br>unlike the law in Davis, all of this is to some extent out of the pri&para;<br>vately financed candidate’s hands. Spending by independent expen&para;<br>diture groups to promote a privately financed candidate’s election&para;<br>triggers matching funds, regardless whether such support is welcome&para;<br>or helpful. Those funds go directly to the publicly funded candidate&para;<br>to use as he sees fit. That disparity in control—giving money directly&para;<br>to a publicly financed candidate, in response to independent expendi&para;<br>tures that cannot be coordinated with the privately funded candi&para;<br>date—is a substantial advantage for the publicly funded candidate.&para;<br>The burdens that matching funds impose on independent expendi&para;<br>ture groups are akin to those imposed on the privately financed can&para;<br>didates themselves. The more money spent on behalf of a privately&para;<br>financed candidate or in opposition to a publicly funded candidate,&para;<br>the more money the publicly funded candidate receives from the&para;<br>State. The effect of a dollar spent on election speech is a guaranteed&para;<br>financial payout to the publicly funded candidate the group opposes,&para;<br>and spending one dollar can result in the flow of dollars to multiple&para;<br>candidates. In some ways, the burdens imposed on independent&para;<br>groups by matching funds are more severe than the burdens imposed&para;<br>on privately financed candidates. Independent groups, of course, are&para;<br>not eligible for public financing. As a result, those groups can only&para;<br>avoid matching funds by changing their message or choosing not to&para;<br>speak altogether. Presenting independent expenditure groups with&para;<br>such a choice—trigger matching funds, change your message, or do&para;<br>not speak—makes the matching funds provision particularly burden&para;<br>some to those groups and certainly contravenes “the fundamental&para;<br>rule of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the&para;<br>autonomy to choose the content of his own message.” Hurley v. IrishAmerican Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S.&para;<br>557, 573. Pp. 10–14.&para;<br>(3) The arguments of Arizona, the Clean Elections Institute, and&para;<br>amicus United States attempting to explain away the existence or&para;<br>significance of any burden imposed by matching funds are unpersua&para;<br>sive.&para;<br>Arizona correctly points out that its law is different from the law&para;<br>invalidated in Davis, but there is no doubt that the burden on speech&para;<br>is significantly greater here than in Davis. Arizona argues that the&para;<br>provision actually creates more speech. But even if that were the&para;<br>case, only the speech of publicly financed candidates is increased by&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM &para;<br>&para;<br>CLUB PAC v. BENNETT&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>the state law. And burdening the speech of some—here privately fi&para;<br>nanced candidates and independent expenditure groups—to increase&para;<br>the speech of others is a concept “wholly foreign to the First Amend&para;<br>ment,” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 48–49; cf. Miami Herald Pub&para;<br>lishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241, 244, 258. That no candidate or&para;<br>group is forced to express a particular message does not mean that&para;<br>the matching funds provision does not burden their speech, especially&para;<br>since the direct result of that speech is a state-provided monetary&para;<br>subsidy to a political rival. And precedents upholding government&para;<br>subsidies against First Amendment challenge provide no support for&para;<br>matching funds; none of the subsidies at issue in those cases were&para;<br>granted in response to the speech of another.&para;<br>The burden on privately financed candidates and independent ex&para;<br>penditure groups also cannot be analogized to the burden placed on&para;<br>speakers by the disclosure and disclaimer requirements upheld in&para;<br>Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___. A political&para;<br>candidate’s disclosure of his funding resources does not result in a&para;<br>cash windfall to his opponent, or affect their respective disclosure ob&para;<br>ligations.&para;<br>The burden imposed by the matching funds provision is evident&para;<br>and inherent in the choice that confronts privately financed candi&para;<br>dates and independent expenditure groups. Indeed every court to&para;<br>have considered the question after Davis has concluded that a candi&para;<br>date or independent group might not spend money if the direct result&para;<br>of that spending is additional funding to political adversaries. Ari&para;<br>zona is correct that the candidates do not complain that providing a&para;<br>lump sum payment equivalent to the maximum state financing that&para;<br>a candidate could obtain through matching funds would be imper&para;<br>missible. But it is not the amount of funding that the State provides&para;<br>that is constitutionally problematic. It is the manner in which that&para;<br>funding is provided—in direct response to the political speech of pri&para;<br>vately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.&para;<br>Pp. 14–22.&para;<br>(b) Arizona’s matching funds provision is not “ ‘justified by a com&para;<br>pelling state interest,’ ” Davis, supra, at 740. Pp. 22–28.&para;<br>(1) There is ample support for the argument that the purpose of&para;<br>the matching funds provision is to “level the playing field” in terms of&para;<br>candidate resources. The clearest evidence is that the provision op&para;<br>erates to ensure that campaign funding is equal, up to three times&para;<br>the initial public funding allotment. The text of the Arizona Act con&para;<br>firms this purpose. The provision setting up the matching funds re&para;<br>gime is titled “Equal funding of candidates,” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.&para;<br>§16–952; and the Act and regulations refer to the funds as “equaliz&para;<br>ing funds,” e.g., §16–952(C)(4). This Court has repeatedly rejected&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>the argument that the government has a compelling state interest in&para;<br>“leveling the playing field” that can justify undue burdens on political&para;<br>speech, see, e.g., Citizens United, supra, at ___, and the burdens im&para;<br>posed by matching funds cannot be justified by the pursuit of such an&para;<br>interest. Pp. 22–25.&para;<br>(2) Even if the objective of the matching funds provision is to&para;<br>combat corruption—and not “level the playing field”—the burdens&para;<br>that the matching funds provision imposes on protected political&para;<br>speech are not justified. Burdening a candidate’s expenditure of his&para;<br>own funds on his own campaign does not further the State’s anticor&para;<br>ruption interest. Indeed, “reliance on personal funds reduces the&para;<br>threat of corruption.” Davis, supra, at 740–741; see Buckley, supra,&para;<br>at 53. The burden on independent expenditures also cannot be sup&para;<br>ported by the anticorruption interest. Such expenditures are “politi&para;<br>cal speech . . . not coordinated with a candidate.” Citizens United,&para;<br>558 U. S., at ___. That separation negates the possibility that the ex&para;<br>penditures will result in the sort of quid pro quo corruption with&para;<br>which this Court’s case law is concerned. See e.g., id., at ___–___.&para;<br>Moreover, “[t]he interest in alleviating the corrupting influence of&para;<br>large contributions is served by . . . contribution limitations.” Buck&para;<br>ley, supra, at 55. Given Arizona’s contribution limits, some of the&para;<br>most austere in the Nation, its strict disclosure requirements, and&para;<br>the general availability of public funding, it is hard to imagine what&para;<br>marginal corruption deterrence could be generated by the matching&para;<br>funds provision.&para;<br>The State and the Clean Elections Institute contend that even if&para;<br>the matching funds provision does not directly serve the anticorrup&para;<br>tion interest, it indirectly does so by ensuring that enough candidates&para;<br>participate in the State’s public funding system, which in turn helps&para;<br>combat corruption. But the fact that burdening constitutionally pro&para;<br>tected speech might indirectly serve the State’s anticorruption inter&para;<br>est, by encouraging candidates to take public financing, does not es&para;<br>tablish the constitutionality of the matching funds provision. The&para;<br>matching funds provision substantially burdens speech, to an even&para;<br>greater extent than the law invalidated in Davis. Those burdens&para;<br>cannot be justified by a desire to “level the playing field,” and much of&para;<br>the speech burdened by the matching funds provision does not pose a&para;<br>danger of corruption. The fact that the State may feel that the&para;<br>matching funds provision is necessary to allow it to calibrate its pub&para;<br>lic funding system to achieve its desired level of participation—&para;<br>without an undue drain on public resources—is not a sufficient justi&para;<br>fication for the burden.&para;<br>The flaw in the State’s argument is apparent in what its reasoning&para;<br>would allow. By the State’s logic it could award publicly financed&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM &para;<br>&para;<br>CLUB PAC v. BENNETT&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>candidates five dollars for every dollar spent by a privately financed&para;<br>candidate, or force candidates who wish to run on private funds to&para;<br>pay a $10,000 fine, in order to encourage participation in the public&para;<br>funding regime. Such measures might well promote such participa&para;<br>tion, but would clearly suppress or unacceptably alter political&para;<br>speech. How the State chooses to encourage participation in its pub&para;<br>lic funding system matters, and the Court has never held that a State&para;<br>may burden political speech—to the extent the matching funds provi&para;<br>sion does—to ensure adequate participation in a public funding sys&para;<br>tem. Pp. 25–28.&para;<br>(c) Evaluating the wisdom of public financing as a means of fund&para;<br>ing political candidacy is not the Court’s business. But determining&para;<br>whether laws governing campaign finance violate the First Amend&para;<br>ment is. The government “may engage in public financing of election&para;<br>campaigns,” and doing so can further “significant governmental in&para;<br>terest[s].” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65, 92–93, 96. But the goal of&para;<br>creating a viable public financing scheme can only be pursued in a&para;<br>manner consistent with the First Amendment. Arizona’s program&para;<br>gives money to a candidate in direct response to the campaign speech&para;<br>of an opposing candidate or an independent group. It does this when&para;<br>the opposing candidate has chosen not to accept public financing, and&para;<br>has engaged in political speech above a level set by the State. This&para;<br>goes too far; Arizona’s matching funds provision substantially bur&para;<br>dens the speech of privately financed candidates and independent&para;<br>expenditure groups without serving a compelling state interest.&para;<br>Pp. 28–30.&para;<br>&para;<br>611 F. 3d 510, reversed.&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

All&para;<br>eligible candidates for Governor, secretary of state, attor&para;<br>ney general, treasurer, superintendent of public instruc&para;<br>tion, the corporation commission, mine inspector, and the&para;<br>state legislature (both the House and Senate) may opt&para;<br>to receive public funding. §16–950(D) (West Supp. 2010).&para;<br>Eligibility is contingent on the collection of a specified&para;<br>number of five-dollar contributions from Arizona voters,&para;<br>§§16–946(B) (West 2006), 16–950 (West Supp. 2010),1 and&para;<br>the acceptance of certain campaign restrictions and obliga&para;<br>tions.

In an election where a pri&para;<br>vately funded candidate faces multiple publicly financed&para;<br>candidates, one dollar raised or spent by the privately fi&para;<br>nanced candidate results in an almost one dollar increase&para;<br>in public funding to each of the publicly financed candi&para;<br>dates.&para;<br>Once the public financing cap is exceeded, additional&para;<br>expenditures by independent groups can result in dollar&para;<br>for-dollar matching funds as well.

In the last general&para;<br>election, the number of candidates competing for the two&para;<br>available seats in each district ranged from two to seven.&para;<br>See State of Arizona Official Canvass, 2010 General Elec&para;<br>tion Report (compiled and issued by the Arizona secretary&para;<br>of state). Arizona’s Fourth District had three candidates&para;<br>for its two available House seats. Two of those candidates&para;<br>opted to accept public funding; one candidate chose to&para;<br>operate his campaign with private funds.&para;<br>In that election, if the total funds contributed to the&para;<br>privately funded candidate, added to that candidate’s&para;<br>expenditure of personal funds and the expenditures of&para;<br>supportive independent groups, exceeded $21,479—the&para;<br>allocation of public funds for the general election in a&para;<br>contested State House race—the matching funds provision&para;<br>would be triggered.

Federal Election Comm’n, 554 U. S. 724 (2008).&para;<br>In Davis, we considered a First Amendment challenge to&para;<br>the so-called “Millionaire’s Amendment” of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, 2 U. S. C. §441a–1(a).&para;<br>Under that Amendment, if a candidate for the&para;<br>United States House of Representatives spent more than&para;<br>$350,000 of his personal funds, “a new, asymmetrical&para;<br>regulatory scheme [came] into play.” 554 U. S., at 729.&para;<br>The opponent of the candidate who exceeded that limit&para;<br>was permitted to collect individual contributions up to&para;<br>$6,900 per contributor—three times the normal contribu&para;<br>tion limit of $2,300. See ibid.

BENNETT&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>the original contribution cap. Davis argued that this&para;<br>scheme “burden[ed] his exercise of his First Amendment&para;<br>right to make unlimited expenditures of his personal&para;<br>funds because” doing so had “the effect of enabling his&para;<br>opponent to raise more money and to use that money to&para;<br>finance speech that counteract[ed] and thus diminishe[d]&para;<br>the effectiveness of Davis’ own speech.” Id., at 736.&para;<br>In addressing the constitutionality of the Millionaire’s&para;<br>Amendment, we acknowledged that the provision did not&para;<br>impose an outright cap on a candidate’s personal expendi&para;<br>tures. Id., at 738–739. We nonetheless concluded that&para;<br>the Amendment was unconstitutional because it forced a&para;<br>candidate “to choose between the First Amendment right&para;<br>to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to&para;<br>discriminatory fundraising limitations.” Id., at 739. Any&para;<br>candidate who chose to spend more than $350,000 of his&para;<br>own money was forced to “shoulder a special and poten&para;<br>tially significant burden” because that choice gave fund&para;<br>raising advantages to the candidate’s adversary. Ibid. We&para;<br>determined that this constituted an “unprecedented pen&para;<br>alty” and “impose[d] a substantial burden on the exercise&para;<br>of the First Amendment right to use personal funds for&para;<br>campaign speech,” and concluded that the Government&para;<br>had failed to advance any compelling interest that would&para;<br>justify such a burden. Id., at 739–740.&para;<br>A&para;<br>1&para;<br>The logic of Davis largely controls our approach to this&para;<br>case. Much like the burden placed on speech in Davis, the&para;<br>matching funds provision “imposes an unprecedented&para;<br>penalty on any candidate who robustly exercises [his]&para;<br>First Amendment right[s].” Id., at 739. Under that provi&para;<br>sion, “the vigorous exercise of the right to use personal&para;<br>funds to finance campaign speech” leads to “advantages&para;<br>for opponents in the competitive context of electoral poli&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tics.” Ibid.&para;<br>Once a privately financed candidate has raised or spent&para;<br>more than the State’s initial grant to a publicly financed&para;<br>candidate, each personal dollar spent by the privately&para;<br>financed candidate results in an award of almost one&para;<br>additional dollar to his opponent. That plainly forces the&para;<br>privately financed candidate to “shoulder a special and&para;<br>potentially significant burden” when choosing to exercise&para;<br>his First Amendment right to spend funds on behalf of his&para;<br>candidacy. Ibid. If the law at issue in Davis imposed a&para;<br>burden on candidate speech, the Arizona law unques&para;<br>tionably does so as well.&para;<br>The penalty imposed by Arizona’s matching funds provi&para;<br>sion is different in some respects from the penalty imposed&para;<br>by the law we struck down in Davis. But those differences&para;<br>make the Arizona law more constitutionally problematic,&para;<br>not less. See Green Party of Conn. v. Garfield, 616 F. 3d&para;<br>213, 244–245 (CA2 2010). First, the penalty in Davis&para;<br>consisted of raising the contribution limits for one of the&para;<br>candidates. The candidate who benefited from the in&para;<br>creased limits still had to go out and raise the funds. He&para;<br>may or may not have been able to do so. The other candi&para;<br>date, therefore, faced merely the possibility that his oppo&para;<br>nent would be able to raise additional funds, through&para;<br>contribution limits that remained subject to a cap. And&para;<br>still the Court held that this was an “unprecedented pen&para;<br>alty,” a “special and potentially significant burden” that&para;<br>had to be justified by a compelling state interest—a rigor&para;<br>ous First Amendment hurdle. 554 U. S., at 739–740.&para;<br>Here the benefit to the publicly financed candidate is the&para;<br>direct and automatic release of public money. That is a&para;<br>far heavier burden than in Davis.&para;<br>Second, depending on the specifics of the election at&para;<br>issue, the matching funds provision can create a multiplier&para;<br>effect. In the Arizona Fourth District House election pre&para;<br>viously discussed, see supra, at 4–6, if the spending cap&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM &para;<br>&para;<br>CLUB PAC v. BENNETT&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>were exceeded, each dollar spent by the privately funded&para;<br>candidate would result in an additional dollar of campaign&para;<br>funding to each of that candidate’s publicly financed oppo&para;<br>nents. In such a situation, the matching funds provi&para;<br>sion forces privately funded candidates to fight a political&para;<br>hydra of sorts. Each dollar they spend generates two&para;<br>adversarial dollars in response. Again, a markedly more&para;<br>significant burden than in Davis.&para;<br>Third, unlike the law at issue in Davis, all of this is&para;<br>to some extent out of the privately financed candidate’s&para;<br>hands. Even if that candidate opted to spend less than the&para;<br>initial public financing cap, any spending by independent&para;<br>expenditure groups to promote the privately financed&para;<br>candidate’s election—regardless whether such support&para;<br>was welcome or helpful—could trigger matching funds.&para;<br>What is more, that state money would go directly to the&para;<br>publicly funded candidate to use as he saw fit. That&para;<br>disparity in control—giving money directly to a publicly&para;<br>financed candidate, in response to independent expendi&para;<br>tures that cannot be coordinated with the privately funded&para;<br>candidate—is a substantial advantage for the publicly&para;<br>funded candidate. That candidate can allocate the money&para;<br>according to his own campaign strategy, which the pri&para;<br>vately financed candidate could not do with the independ&para;<br>ent group expenditures that triggered the matching funds.&para;<br>Cf. Citizens United, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 41) (“ ‘The&para;<br>absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expen&para;<br>diture with the candidate or his agent . . . undermines the&para;<br>value of the expenditure to the candidate’ ” (quoting Buck&para;<br>ley, 424 U. S., at 47)).&para;<br>The burdens that this regime places on independent&para;<br>expenditure groups are akin to those imposed on the&para;<br>privately financed candidates themselves. Just as with&para;<br>the candidate the independent group supports, the more&para;<br>money spent on that candidate’s behalf or in opposition to&para;<br>a publicly funded candidate, the more money the publicly&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>funded candidate receives from the State. And just as&para;<br>with the privately financed candidate, the effect of a dollar&para;<br>spent on election speech is a guaranteed financial payout&para;<br>to the publicly funded candidate the group opposes. More&para;<br>over, spending one dollar can result in the flow of dollars&para;<br>to multiple candidates the group disapproves of, dollars&para;<br>directly controlled by the publicly funded candidate or&para;<br>candidates.&para;<br>In some ways, the burden the Arizona law imposes on&para;<br>independent expenditure groups is worse than the burden&para;<br>it imposes on privately financed candidates, and thus&para;<br>substantially worse than the burden we found constitu&para;<br>tionally impermissible in Davis. If a candidate contem&para;<br>plating an electoral run in Arizona surveys the campaign&para;<br>landscape and decides that the burdens imposed by the&para;<br>matching funds regime make a privately funded campaign&para;<br>unattractive, he at least has the option of taking public&para;<br>financing. Independent expenditure groups, of course, do&para;<br>not.&para;<br>Once the spending cap is reached, an independent ex&para;<br>penditure group that wants to support a particular candi&para;<br>date—because of that candidate’s stand on an issue of con&para;<br>cern to the group—can only avoid triggering matching&para;<br>funds in one of two ways. The group can either opt to&para;<br>change its message from one addressing the merits of the&para;<br>candidates to one addressing the merits of an issue, or&para;<br>refrain from speaking altogether. Presenting independent&para;<br>expenditure groups with such a choice makes the match&para;<br>ing funds provision particularly burdensome to those&para;<br>groups. And forcing that choice—trigger matching funds,&para;<br>change your message, or do not speak—certainly contra&para;<br>venes “the fundamental rule of protection under the First&para;<br>Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose&para;<br>the content of his own message.” Hurley v.

None is persuasive.&para;<br>Arizona contends that the matching funds provision is&para;<br>distinguishable from the law we invalidated in Davis. The&para;<br>State correctly points out that our decision in Davis fo&para;<br>cused on the asymmetrical contribution limits imposed by&para;<br>the Millionaire’s Amendment. See 554 U. S., at 729. But&para;<br>that is not because—as the State asserts—the reach of&para;<br>that opinion is limited to asymmetrical contribution limits.&para;<br>Brief for State Respondents 26–32. It is because that was&para;<br>the particular burden on candidate speech we faced in&para;<br>Davis. And whatever the significance of the distinction in&para;<br>general, there can be no doubt that the burden on speech&para;<br>is significantly greater in this case than in Davis: That&para;<br>means that the law here—like the one in Davis—must be&para;<br>&para;<br>justified by a compelling state interest. &para;<br>&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>6 The dissent sees “chutzpah” in candidates exercising their right not&para;<br>to participate in the public financing scheme, while objecting that the&para;<br>system violates their First Amendment rights. See post, at 12 (opinion&para;<br>of KAGAN, J.). The charge is unjustified, but, in any event, it certainly&para;<br>cannot be leveled against the independent expenditure groups. The&para;<br>dissent barely mentions such groups in its analysis, and fails to address&para;<br>not only the distinctive burdens imposed on these groups—as set forth&para;<br>above—but also the way in which privately financed candidates are&para;<br>particularly burdened when matching funds are triggered by independ&para;<br>ent group speech.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The State argues that the matching funds provision&para;<br>actually results in more speech by “increas[ing] debate&para;<br>about issues of public concern” in Arizona elections and&para;<br>“promot[ing] the free and open debate that the First&para;<br>Amendment was intended to foster.” Brief for State Re&para;<br>spondents 41; see Brief for Respondent Clean Elections&para;<br>Institute 55. In the State’s view, this promotion of First&para;<br>Amendment ideals offsets any burden the law might&para;<br>impose on some speakers.&para;<br>Not so. Any increase in speech resulting from the Ari&para;<br>zona law is of one kind and one kind only—that of publicly&para;<br>financed candidates. The burden imposed on privately&para;<br>financed candidates and independent expenditure groups&para;<br>reduces their speech; “restriction[s] on the amount of&para;<br>money a person or group can spend on political communi&para;<br>cation during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity&para;<br>of expression.” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 19. Thus, even if the&para;<br>matching funds provision did result in more speech by&para;<br>publicly financed candidates and more speech in general,&para;<br>it would do so at the expense of impermissibly burdening&para;<br>(and thus reducing) the speech of privately financed&para;<br>candidates and independent expenditure groups. This&para;<br>sort of “beggar thy neighbor” approach to free speech—&para;<br>“restrict[ing] the speech of some elements of our society in&para;<br>order to enhance the relative voice of others”—is “wholly&para;<br>foreign to the First Amendment.” Id., at 48–49.7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent also repeatedly argues that the Arizona matching funds&para;<br>regime results in “more political speech,” post, at 9 (emphasis in origi&para;<br>nal); see post, at 2, 10, 13, 16, 32, but—given the logic of the dissent’s&para;<br>position—that is only as a step to less speech. If the matching funds&para;<br>provision achieves its professed goal and causes candidates to switch to&para;<br>public financing, post, at 25, 30, there will be less speech: no spending&para;<br>above the initial state-set amount by formerly privately financed&para;<br>candidates, and no associated matching funds for anyone. Not only&para;<br>that, the level of speech will depend on the State’s judgment of the&para;<br>desirable amount, an amount tethered to available (and often scarce)&para;<br>state resources.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM &para;<br>&para;<br>CLUB PAC v.

The clearest evidence is&para;<br>of course the very operation of the provision: It ensures&para;<br>that campaign funding is equal, up to three times the&para;<br>initial public funding allotment. The text of the Citizens&para;<br>Clean Elections Act itself confirms this purpose. The sta&para;<br>tutory provision setting up the matching funds regime&para;<br>is titled “Equal funding of candidates.” Ariz. Rev. Stat.&para;<br>Ann. §16–952 (West Supp. 2010). The Act refers to the&para;<br>funds doled out after the Act’s matching mechanism is&para;<br>triggered as “equalizing funds.” See §§16–952(C)(4), (5).&para;<br>And the regulations implementing the matching funds&para;<br>provision refer to those funds as “equalizing funds” as&para;<br>well. See Citizens Clean Elections Commission, Ariz.&para;<br>Admin. Rule R2–20–113.&para;<br>Other features of the Arizona law reinforce this under&para;<br>standing of the matching funds provision. If the Citizens&para;<br>Clean Election Commission cannot provide publicly fi&para;<br>nanced candidates with the moneys that the matching&para;<br>funds provision envisions because of a shortage of funds,&para;<br>the statute allows a publicly financed candidate to “accept&para;<br>private contributions to bring the total monies received by&para;<br>the candidate” up to the matching funds amount. Ariz.&para;<br>Rev. Stat. Ann. §16–954(F) (West 2006). Limiting contri&para;<br>butions, of course, is the primary means we have upheld to&para;<br>combat corruption. Buckley, 424 U.

See&para;<br>Brief for State Respondents 45–46. But when confronted&para;<br>with a choice between fighting corruption and equalizing&para;<br>speech, the drafters of the matching funds provision chose&para;<br>the latter.

S., at 56; see id., at 56–57. After all,&para;<br>equalizing campaign resources “might serve not to equal&para;<br>ize the opportunities of all candidates, but to handicap a&para;<br>candidate who lacked substantial name recognition or&para;<br>exposure of his views before the start of the campaign.”&para;<br>Id., at 57.&para;<br>“Leveling electoral opportunities means making and&para;<br>implementing judgments about which strengths should be&para;<br>permitted to contribute to the outcome of an election,”&para;<br>Davis, supra, at 742—a dangerous enterprise and one that&para;<br>cannot justify burdening protected speech. The dissent&para;<br>essentially dismisses this concern, see post, at 27–29, but&para;<br>it needs to be taken seriously; we have, as noted, held that&para;<br>it is not legitimate for the government to attempt to equal&para;<br>ize electoral opportunities in this manner.

But even if&para;<br>the ultimate objective of the matching funds provision is to&para;<br>combat corruption—and not “level the playing field”—the&para;<br>burdens that the matching funds provision imposes on&para;<br>protected political speech are not justified.&para;<br>Burdening a candidate’s expenditure of his own funds&para;<br>on his own campaign does not further the State’s anticor&para;<br>ruption interest.

That&para;<br>is not our business. But determining whether laws gov&para;<br>erning campaign finance violate the First Amendment is&para;<br>very much our business. In carrying out that responsibil&para;<br>ity over the past 35 years, we have upheld some restric&para;<br>tions on speech and struck down others. See, e.g., Buckley,&para;<br>supra, at 35–38, 51–54 (upholding contribution limits and&para;<br>striking down expenditure limits); Colorado I, 518 U. S.,&para;<br>at 608 (opinion of BREYER, J.)

Buckley, 424&para;<br>U. S., at 57, n. 65, 92–93, 96. But the goal of creating&para;<br>a viable public financing scheme can only be pursued in a&para;<br>manner consistent with the First Amendment. The dis&para;<br>sent criticizes the Court for standing in the way of what&para;<br>the people of Arizona want. Post, at 2–3, 31–32. But the&para;<br>whole point of the First Amendment is to protect speakers&para;<br>against unjustified government restrictions on speech,&para;<br>even when those restrictions reflect the will of the major&para;<br>ity. When it comes to protected speech, the speaker is&para;<br>sovereign.&para;<br>Arizona’s program gives money to a candidate in direct&para;<br>response to the campaign speech of an opposing candidate&para;<br>or an independent group. It does this when the opposing&para;<br>candidate has chosen not to accept public financing, and&para;<br>has engaged in political speech above a level set by the&para;<br>State. The professed purpose of the state law is to cause a&para;<br>sufficient number of candidates to sign up for public fi&para;<br>nancing, see post, at 5, which subjects them to the various&para;<br>restrictions on speech that go along with that program.&para;<br>This goes too far; Arizona’s matching funds provision&para;<br>substantially burdens the speech of privately financed&para;<br>candidates and independent expenditure groups without&para;<br>serving a compelling state interest.&para;<br>“[T]here is practically universal agreement that a major&para;<br>purpose of” the First Amendment “was to protect the free&para;<br>discussion of governmental affairs,” “includ[ing] discus&para;<br>sions of candidates.” Buckley, 424 U.

Individuals who “bun&para;<br>dle” campaign contributions become indispensable to&para;<br>candidates in need of money. Simple disclosure fails to&para;<br>prevent shady dealing. And candidates choose not to&para;<br>participate in the public financing system because the&para;<br>sums provided do not make them competitive with their&para;<br>privately financed opponents. So the State remains af&para;<br>flicted with corruption.&para;<br>Voters of the second State, having witnessed this fail&para;<br>ure, take an ever-so-slightly different tack to cleaning up&para;<br>their political system. They too enact contribution limits&para;<br>and disclosure requirements. But they believe that the&para;<br>greatest hope of eliminating corruption lies in creating an&para;<br>effective public financing program, which will break can&para;<br>didates’ dependence on large donors and bundlers.

So the voters enact a program that&para;<br>carefully adjusts the money given to would-be officehold&para;<br>ers, through the use of a matching funds mechanism, in&para;<br>order to provide this assurance.

The First Amendment, the&para;<br>majority insists, requires us all to rely on the measures&para;<br>employed in the first State, even when they have failed to&para;<br>break the stranglehold of special interests on elected&para;<br>officials.&para;<br>I disagree. The First Amendment’s core purpose is&para;<br>to foster a healthy, vibrant political system full of robust discussion and debate. Nothing in Arizona’s anti&para;<br>corruption statute, the Arizona Citizens Clean Elections&para;<br>Act, violates this constitutional protection. To the con&para;<br>trary, the Act promotes the values underlying both the&para;<br>First Amendment and our entire Constitution by enhanc&para;<br>ing the “opportunity for free political discussion to the end&para;<br>that government may be responsive to the will of the&para;<br>people.” Id., at 269 (internal quotation marks omitted). I&para;<br>therefore respectfully dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Campaign finance reform over the last century has&para;<br>focused on one key question: how to prevent massive pools&para;<br>of private money from corrupting our political system. If&para;<br>an officeholder owes his election to wealthy contributors,&para;<br>he may act for their benefit alone, rather than on behalf of&para;<br>all the people. As we recognized in Buckley v. Valeo, 424&para;<br>U. S. 1, 26 (1976) (per curiam), our seminal campaign&para;<br>finance case, large private contributions may result in&para;<br>“political quid pro quo[s],” which undermine the integrity&para;<br>of our democracy. And even if these contributions are not&para;<br>converted into corrupt bargains, they still may weaken&para;<br>confidence in our political system because the public per&para;<br>ceives “the opportunities for abuse[s].” Id., at 27.

BENNETT&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>prevent both corruption and the appearance of corrup&para;<br>tion—and so to protect our democratic system of govern&para;<br>ance—citizens have implemented reforms designed to curb&para;<br>the power of special interests.&para;<br>Among these measures, public financing of elections has&para;<br>emerged as a potentially potent mechanism to preserve&para;<br>elected officials’ independence. President Theodore Roo&para;<br>sevelt proposed the reform as early as 1907 in his State&para;<br>of the Union address. “The need for collecting large cam&para;<br>paign funds would vanish,” he said, if the government “pro&para;<br>vided an appropriation for the proper and legitimate ex&para;<br>penses” of running a campaign, on the condition that a&para;<br>“party receiving campaign funds from the Treasury” would&para;<br>forgo private fundraising. 42 Cong. Rec. 78 (1907). The&para;<br>idea was—and remains—straightforward.&para;<br>Candidates&para;<br>who rely on public, rather than private, moneys are “be&para;<br>holden [to] no person and, if elected, should feel no post&para;<br>election obligation toward any contributor.” Republican&para;<br>Nat. Comm. v. FEC, 487 F. Supp. 280, 284 (SDNY), aff’d&para;<br>445 U. S. 955 (1980). By supplanting private cash in&para;<br>elections, public financing eliminates the source of politi&para;<br>cal corruption.&para;<br>For this reason, public financing systems today dot the&para;<br>national landscape. Almost one-third of the States have&para;<br>adopted some form of public financing, and so too has&para;<br>the Federal Government for presidential elections. See&para;<br>R. Garrett, Congressional Research Service Report for&para;<br>Congress, Public Financing of Congressional Campaigns:&para;<br>Overview and Analysis 2, 32 (2009). The federal pro&para;<br>gram—which offers presidential candidates a fixed public&para;<br>subsidy if they abstain from private fundraising—&para;<br>originated in the campaign finance law that Congress&para;<br>enacted in 1974 on the heels of the Watergate scandal.&para;<br>Congress explained at the time that the “potentia[l] for&para;<br>abuse” inherent in privately funded elections was “all too&para;<br>clear.” S. Rep. No. 93–689, p. 4 (1974). In Congress’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

[to]&para;<br>eliminate reliance on large private contributions” and its&para;<br>attendant danger of corruption, while still ensuring that a&para;<br>wide range of candidates had access to the ballot. Id., at 5&para;<br>(emphasis deleted).&para;<br>We declared the presidential public financing system con&para;<br>stitutional in Buckley v. Valeo. Congress, we stated, had&para;<br>created the program “for the ‘general welfare’—to reduce the deleterious influence of large contributions on&para;<br>our political process,” as well as to “facilitate communica&para;<br>tion by candidates with the electorate, and to free candi&para;<br>dates from the rigors of fundraising.” 424 U. S., at 91. We&para;<br>reiterated “that public financing as a means of eliminat&para;<br>ing the improper influence of large private contributions&para;<br>furthers a significant governmental interest.” Id., at 96.&para;<br>And finally, in rejecting a challenge based on the First&para;<br>Amendment, we held that the program did not “restrict[]&para;<br>or censor speech, but rather . . . use[d] public money to&para;<br>facilitate and enlarge public discussion and participation&para;<br>in the electoral process.” Id., at 92–93. We declared this&para;<br>result “vital to a self-governing people,” and so concluded&para;<br>that the program “further[ed], not abridge[d], pertinent&para;<br>First Amendment values.” Id., at 93. We thus gave state&para;<br>and municipal governments the green light to adopt public&para;<br>financing systems along the presidential model.&para;<br>But this model, which distributes a lump-sum grant at&para;<br>the beginning of an election cycle, has a significant weak&para;<br>ness: It lacks a mechanism for setting the subsidy at a&para;<br>level that will give candidates sufficient incentive to par&para;<br>ticipate, while also conserving public resources. Public&para;<br>financing can achieve its goals only if a meaningful num&para;<br>ber of candidates receive the state subsidy, rather than&para;<br>raise private funds. See 611 F. 3d 510, 527 (CA9 2010) (“A&para;<br>public financing system with no participants does nothing&para;<br>to reduce the existence or appearance of quid pro quo&para;<br>corruption”). But a public funding program must be vol&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM &para;<br>&para;<br>CLUB PAC v. BENNETT&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>untary to pass constitutional muster, because of its re&para;<br>strictions on contributions and expenditures. See Buckley,&para;<br>424 U. S., at 57, n. 65, 95. And candidates will choose to&para;<br>sign up only if the subsidy provided enables them to run&para;<br>competitive races. If the grant is pegged too low, it puts&para;<br>the participating candidate at a disadvantage: Because he&para;<br>has agreed to spend no more than the amount of the sub&para;<br>sidy, he will lack the means to respond if his privately&para;<br>funded opponent spends over that threshold. So when&para;<br>lump-sum grants do not keep up with campaign expendi&para;<br>tures, more and more candidates will choose not to par&para;<br>ticipate.1 But if the subsidy is set too high, it may impose&para;<br>an unsustainable burden on the public fisc. See 611 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 527 (noting that large subsidies would make public&para;<br>funding “prohibitively expensive and spell its doom”). At&para;<br>the least, hefty grants will waste public resources in the&para;<br>many state races where lack of competition makes such&para;<br>funding unnecessary.&para;<br>The difficulty, then, is in finding the Goldilocks solu&para;<br>tion—not too large, not too small, but just right. And&para;<br>this in a world of countless variables—where the amount&para;<br>of money needed to run a viable campaign against a pri&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The problem is apparent in the federal system. In recent years, the&para;<br>number of presidential candidates opting to receive public financing&para;<br>has declined because the subsidy has not kept pace with spending&para;<br>by privately financed candidates. See Corrado, Public Funding of&para;<br>Presidential Campaigns, in The New Campaign Finance Sourcebook&para;<br>180, 200 (A. Corrado, T. Mann, D. Ortiz, &amp; T. Potter eds. 2005).

A state may&para;<br>set lump-sum grants district-by-district, based on spend&para;<br>ing in past elections; but even that approach leaves out&para;<br>many factors—including the resources of the privately&para;<br>funded candidate—that alter the competitiveness of a seat&para;<br>from one election to the next. See App. 714–716 (record&para;<br>evidence chronicling the history of variation in campaign&para;<br>spending levels in Arizona’s legislative districts). In short,&para;<br>the dynamic nature of our electoral system makes ex ante&para;<br>predictions about campaign expenditures almost impossi&para;<br>ble. And that creates a chronic problem for lump-sum&para;<br>public financing programs, because inaccurate estimates&para;<br>produce subsidies that either dissuade candidates from&para;<br>participating or waste taxpayer money. And so States&para;<br>have made adjustments to the lump-sum scheme that we&para;<br>approved in Buckley, in attempts to more effectively re&para;<br>duce corruption.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The people of Arizona had every reason to try to develop&para;<br>effective anti-corruption measures. Before turning to pub&para;<br>lic financing, Arizonans voted by referendum to estab&para;<br>lish campaign contribution limits. See Ariz. Rev. Stat.&para;<br>Ann. §16–905 (West Supp. 2010). But that effort to abate&para;<br>corruption, standing alone, proved unsuccessful. Five&para;<br>years after the enactment of these limits, the State suf&para;<br>fered “the worst public corruption scandal in its history.”&para;<br>Brief for State Respondents 1. In that scandal, known&para;<br>as “AzScam,” nearly 10% of the State’s legislators were&para;<br>caught accepting campaign contributions or bribes in ex&para;<br>change for supporting a piece of legislation. Following&para;<br>that incident, the voters of Arizona decided that further&para;<br>reform was necessary. Acting once again by referendum,&para;<br>they adopted the public funding system at issue here.&para;<br>The hallmark of Arizona’s program is its inventive&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM &para;<br>&para;<br>CLUB PAC v. BENNETT&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>approach to the challenge that bedevils all public financ&para;<br>ing schemes: fixing the amount of the subsidy. For each&para;<br>electoral contest, the system calibrates the size of the&para;<br>grant automatically to provide sufficient—but no more&para;<br>than sufficient—funds to induce voluntary participation.&para;<br>In effect, the program’s designers found the Goldilocks&para;<br>solution, which produces the “just right” grant to ensure&para;<br>that a participant in the system has the funds needed to&para;<br>run a competitive race.&para;<br>As the Court explains, Arizona’s matching funds ar&para;<br>rangement responds to the shortcoming of the lump-sum&para;<br>model by adjusting the public subsidy in each race to re&para;<br>flect the expenditures of a privately financed candidate&para;<br>and the independent groups that support him. See Ariz.&para;<br>Rev. Stat. Ann. §16–940 et seq. (West 2006 and West&para;<br>Supp. 2010). A publicly financed candidate in Arizona&para;<br>receives an initial lump-sum to get his campaign off the&para;<br>ground. See §16–951 (West 2006). But for every dollar his&para;<br>privately funded opponent (or the opponent’s supporters)&para;<br>spends over the initial subsidy, the publicly funded candi&para;<br>date will—to a point—get an additional 94 cents. See&para;<br>§16–952 (West Supp. 2010). Once the publicly financed&para;<br>candidate has received three times the amount of the&para;<br>initial disbursement, he gets no further public funding, see&para;<br>ibid., and remains barred from receiving private contribu&para;<br>tions, no matter how much more his privately funded&para;<br>opponent spends, see §16–941(A).&para;<br>This arrangement, like the lump-sum model, makes use&para;<br>of a pre-set amount to provide financial support to partici&para;<br>pants. For example, all publicly funded legislative candi&para;<br>dates collect an initial grant of $21,479 for a general elec&para;<br>tion race. And they can in no circumstances receive more&para;<br>than three times that amount ($64,437); after that, their&para;<br>privately funded competitors hold a marked advantage.&para;<br>But the Arizona system improves on the lump-sum model&para;<br>in a crucial respect. By tying public funding to private&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>spending, the State can afford to set a more generous&para;<br>upper limit—because it knows that in each campaign it&para;<br>will only have to disburse what is necessary to keep a par&para;<br>ticipating candidate reasonably competitive. Arizona can&para;<br>therefore assure candidates that, if they accept public&para;<br>funds, they will have the resources to run a viable race&para;<br>against those who rely on private money. And at the same&para;<br>time, Arizona avoids wasting taxpayers’ dollars. In this&para;<br>way, the Clean Elections Act creates an effective and&para;<br>sustainable public financing system.&para;<br>The question here is whether this modest adjustment to&para;<br>the public financing program that we approved in Buckley&para;<br>makes the Arizona law unconstitutional. The majority&para;<br>contends that the matching funds provision “substantially&para;<br>burdens protected political speech” and does not “serv[e] a&para;<br>compelling state interest.” Ante, at 2.

That is because subsidies,&para;<br>by definition and contra the majority, do not restrict any&para;<br>speech.&para;<br>No one can claim that Arizona’s law discriminates&para;<br>against particular ideas, and so violates the First Amend&para;<br>ment’s sole limitation on speech subsidies.

In&para;<br>the usual First Amendment subsidy case, a person com&para;<br>plains that the government declined to finance his speech,&para;<br>while bankrolling someone else’s; we must then decide&para;<br>whether the government differentiated between these&para;<br>speakers on a prohibited basis—because it preferred one&para;<br>speaker’s ideas to another’s. See, e.g., id., at 577–578;&para;<br>Regan, 461 U. S., at 543–545. But the candidates bringing&para;<br>this challenge do not make that claim—because they were&para;<br>never denied a subsidy. Arizona, remember, offers to&para;<br>support any person running for state office. Petitioners&para;<br>here refused that assistance. So they are making a novel&para;<br>argument: that Arizona violated their First Amendment&para;<br>rights by disbursing funds to other speakers even&para;<br>though they could have received (but chose to spurn) the&para;<br>same financial assistance. Some people might call that&para;<br>chutzpah.&para;<br>Indeed, what petitioners demand is essentially a right to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>majority claims that none of our subsidy cases involved the&para;<br>funding of “respons[ive]” expression. See ante, at 17. But the majority&para;<br>does not explain why this distinction, created to fit the facts of this&para;<br>case, should matter so long as the government is not discriminating on&para;<br>the basis of viewpoint. Indeed, the difference the majority highlights&para;<br>should cut in the opposite direction, because facilitating responsive&para;<br>speech fosters “uninhibited, robust, and wide-open” public debate. New&para;<br>York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 270 (1964). In any event, the&para;<br>majority is wrong to say that we have never approved funding to “allow&para;<br>the recipient to counter” someone else’s political speech. Ante, at 17.&para;<br>That is exactly what we approved in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976)&para;<br>(per curiam). See supra, at 5. The majority notes that the public&para;<br>financing scheme in Buckley lacked the trigger mechanism used in the&para;<br>Arizona law. See ante, at 17, n. 9. But again, that is just to describe a&para;<br>difference, not to say why it matters. As I will show, the trigger is&para;<br>constitutionally irrelevant—as we made clear in the very case (Davis v.&para;<br>Federal Election Comm’n, 554 U.

Petitioners are able to&para;<br>convey their ideas without public financing—and they&para;<br>would prefer the field to themselves, so that they can&para;<br>speak free from response. To attain that goal, they ask&para;<br>this Court to prevent Arizona from funding electoral&para;<br>speech—even though that assistance is offered to every&para;<br>state candidate, on the same (entirely unobjectionable)&para;<br>basis. And this Court gladly obliges.&para;<br>If an ordinary citizen, without the hindrance of a law&para;<br>degree, thought this result an upending of First Amend&para;<br>ment values, he would be correct. That Amendment&para;<br>protects no person’s, nor any candidate’s, “right to be free&para;<br>from vigorous debate.” Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Public&para;<br>Util. Comm’n of Cal., 475 U. S. 1, 14 (1986) (plurality&para;<br>opinion). Indeed, the Amendment exists so that this de&para;<br>bate can occur—robust, forceful, and contested. It is the&para;<br>theory of the Free Speech Clause that “falsehood and&para;<br>fallacies” are exposed through “discussion,” “education,”&para;<br>and “more speech.” Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357,&para;<br>377 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring). Or once again from&para;<br>Citizens United: “[M]ore speech, not less, is the governing&para;<br>rule.” 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 45). And this is no&para;<br>place more true than in elections, where voters’ ability to&para;<br>choose the best representatives depends on debate—on&para;<br>charge and countercharge, call and response. So to invali&para;<br>date a statute that restricts no one’s speech and dis&para;<br>criminates against no idea—that only provides more&para;<br>voices, wider discussion, and greater competition in elec&para;<br>tions—is to undermine, rather than to enforce, the First&para;<br>Amendment.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The majority argues that more speech will quickly become “less&para;<br>speech,” as candidates switch to public funding.

The principal challenge to that&para;<br>system came from minor-party candidates not eligible for&para;<br>benefits—surely more compelling plaintiffs than petition&para;<br>ers, who could have received funding but refused it. Yet&para;<br>we rejected that attack in part because we understood the&para;<br>federal program as supporting, rather than interfering&para;<br>with, expression. See 424 U.

Buckley re&para;<br>jected any idea, along the lines the majority proposes, that&para;<br>a subsidy of electoral speech was in truth a restraint. And&para;<br>more: Buckley recognized that public financing of elections&para;<br>fosters First Amendment principles. “[T]he central pur&para;<br>pose of the Speech and Press Clauses,” we explained, “was&para;<br>to assure a society in which ‘uninhibited, robust, and wide&para;<br>open’ public debate concerning matters of public interest&para;<br>would thrive, for only in such a society can a healthy&para;<br>representative democracy flourish.” 424 U.

Other candidates accept public financing because&para;<br>they believe it will enhance their communication with voters. So the&para;<br>system continually pushes toward more speech. That is exactly what&para;<br>has happened in Arizona, see n. 2, supra, and the majority offers no&para;<br>counter-examples.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>involving speech subsidies. According to the Court, the&para;<br>special problem here lies in Arizona’s matching funds&para;<br>mechanism, which the majority claims imposes a “sub&para;<br>stantia[l] burde[n]” on a privately funded candidate’s&para;<br>speech. Ante, at 2. Sometimes, the majority suggests that&para;<br>this “burden” lies in the way the mechanism “ ‘diminish[es]&para;<br>the effectiveness’ ” of the privately funded candidate’s&para;<br>expression by enabling his opponent to respond. Ante, at&para;<br>10 (quoting Davis v. Federal Election Comm’n, 554 U. S.&para;<br>724, 736 (2008)); see ante, at 21–22. At other times, the&para;<br>majority indicates that the “burden” resides in the deter&para;<br>rent effect of the mechanism: The privately funded candi&para;<br>date “might not spend money” because doing so will trig&para;<br>ger matching funds. Ante, at 20. Either way, the majority&para;<br>is wrong to see a substantial burden on expression.5&para;<br>Most important, and as just suggested, the very notion&para;<br>that additional speech constitutes a “burden” is odd and&para;<br>unsettling. Here is a simple fact: Arizona imposes nothing&para;<br>remotely resembling a coercive penalty on privately&para;<br>funded candidates. The State does not jail them, fine&para;<br>them, or subject them to any kind of lesser disability. (So&para;<br>the majority’s analogies to a fine on speech, ante, at 19, 28,&para;<br>are inapposite.) The only “burden” in this case comes from&para;<br>the grant of a subsidy to another person, and the opportu&para;<br>nity that subsidy allows for responsive speech. But that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The majority’s error on this score extends both to candidates and to&para;<br>independent expenditure groups. Contrary to the majority’s sugges&para;<br>tion, see ante, at 14, n. 6, nearly all of my arguments showing that the&para;<br>Clean Elections Act does not impose a substantial burden apply to both&para;<br>sets of speakers (and apply regardless of whether independent or&para;<br>candidate expenditures trigger the matching funds). That is also true&para;<br>of every one of my arguments demonstrating the State’s compelling&para;<br>interest in this legislation. See infra, at 22–26. But perhaps the best&para;<br>response to the majority’s view that the Act inhibits independent&para;<br>expenditure groups lies in an empirical fact already noted: Expendi&para;<br>tures by these groups have risen by 253% since Arizona’s law was&para;<br>enacted. See n. 2, supra.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM &para;<br>&para;<br>CLUB PAC v. BENNETT&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>means the majority cannot get out from under our subsidy&para;<br>precedents. Once again: We have never, not once, under&para;<br>stood a viewpoint-neutral subsidy given to one speaker to&para;<br>constitute a First Amendment burden on another. (And&para;<br>that is so even when the subsidy is not open to all, as it is&para;<br>here.) Yet in this case, the majority says that the prospect&para;<br>of more speech—responsive speech, competitive speech,&para;<br>the kind of speech that drives public debate—counts as a&para;<br>constitutional injury. That concept, for all the reasons&para;<br>previously given, is “wholly foreign to the First Amend&para;<br>ment.” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 49.&para;<br>But put to one side this most fundamental objection&para;<br>to the majority’s argument; even then, has the majority&para;<br>shown that the burden resulting from the Arizona statute&para;<br>is “substantial”? See Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U. S. 581,&para;<br>592 (2005) (holding that stringent judicial review is “ap&para;<br>propriate only if the burden is severe”). I will not quarrel&para;<br>with the majority’s assertion that responsive speech by&para;<br>one candidate may make another candidate’s speech less&para;<br>effective, see ante, at 21–22; that, after all, is the whole&para;<br>idea of the First Amendment, and a benefit of having more&para;<br>responsive speech. See Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S.&para;<br>616, 630 (1919) (Holmes., J., dissenting) (“[T]he best test&para;<br>of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in&para;<br>the competition of the market”). And I will assume that&para;<br>the operation of this statute may on occasion deter a pri&para;<br>vately funded candidate from spending money, and con&para;<br>veying ideas by that means.6 My guess is that this does&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6I&para;<br>&para;<br>will note, however, that the record evidence of this effect is spotty&para;<br>at best. The majority finds anecdotal evidence supporting its argument&para;<br>on just 6 pages of a 4500-page summary judgment record. See ante, at&para;<br>18–19. (The majority also cites sections of petitioners’ briefs, which cite&para;<br>the same 6 pages in the record. See ante, at 19.) That is consistent&para;<br>with the assessment of the District Court Judge who presided over the&para;<br>proceedings in this case: He stated that petitioners had presented only&para;<br>“vague” and “scattered” evidence of the law’s deterrent impact.

S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>not happen often: Most political candidates, I suspect,&para;<br>have enough faith in the power of their ideas to prefer&para;<br>speech on both sides of an issue to speech on neither. But&para;<br>I will take on faith that the matching funds provision may&para;<br>lead one or another privately funded candidate to stop&para;<br>spending at one or another moment in an election. Still,&para;<br>does that effect count as a severe burden on expression?&para;<br>By the measure of our prior decisions—which have upheld&para;<br>campaign reforms with an equal or greater impact on&para;<br>speech—the answer is no.&para;<br>Number one: Any system of public financing, including&para;<br>the lump-sum model upheld in Buckley, imposes a similar&para;<br>burden on privately funded candidates. Suppose Arizona&para;<br>were to do what all parties agree it could under Buckley—&para;<br>provide a single upfront payment (say, $150,000) to a&para;<br>participating candidate, rather than an initial payment&para;<br>(of $50,000) plus 94% of whatever his privately funded&para;<br>opponent spent, up to a ceiling (the same $150,000). That&para;<br>system would “diminis[h] the effectiveness” of a privately&para;<br>funded candidate’s speech at least as much, and in the&para;<br>same way: It would give his opponent, who presumably&para;<br>would not be able to raise that sum on his own, more&para;<br>money to spend. And so too, a lump-sum system may&para;<br>deter speech. A person relying on private resources might&para;<br>well choose not to enter a race at all, because he knows he&para;<br>will face an adequately funded opponent. And even if he&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. in No. 10–239, p. 54. The appellate court discerned even&para;<br>less evidence of any deterrent effect. Id., at 30 (“No Plaintiff . . . has&para;<br>pointed to any specific instance in which she or he has declined a&para;<br>contribution or failed to make an expenditure for fear of triggering&para;<br>matching funds”); see also id., at 28, 31, 34. I understand the majority&para;<br>to essentially concede this point (“ ‘it is never easy to prove a negative,’ ”&para;<br>ante, at 20) and to say it does not matter (“we do not need empirical&para;<br>evidence,” ibid.). So I will not belabor the issue by detailing the sub&para;<br>stantial testimony (much more than 6 pages worth) that the matching&para;<br>funds provision has not put a dent in privately funded candidates’&para;<br>spending.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM &para;<br>&para;<br>CLUB PAC v. BENNETT&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>decides to run, he likely will choose to speak in different&para;<br>ways—for example, by eschewing dubious, easy-to-answer&para;<br>charges—because his opponent has the ability to respond.&para;<br>Indeed, privately funded candidates may well find the&para;<br>lump-sum system more burdensome than Arizona’s (as&para;<br>suming the lump is big enough). Pretend you are financ&para;<br>ing your campaign through private donations. Would you&para;<br>prefer that your opponent receive a guaranteed, upfront&para;<br>payment of $150,000, or that he receive only $50,000, with&para;<br>the possibility—a possibility that you mostly get to con&para;<br>trol—of collecting another $100,000 somewhere down the&para;<br>road? Me too. That’s the first reason the burden on&para;<br>speech cannot command a different result in this case&para;<br>than in Buckley.&para;<br>Number two: Our decisions about disclosure and dis&para;<br>claimer requirements show the Court is wrong. Starting&para;<br>in Buckley and continuing through last Term, the Court&para;<br>has repeatedly declined to view these requirements as a sub&para;<br>stantial First Amendment burden, even though they dis&para;<br>courage some campaign speech. “It is undoubtedly true,”&para;<br>we stated in Buckley, that public disclosure obligations “will deter some individuals” from engaging in ex&para;<br>pressive activity. 424 U. S., at 68; see Davis, 554 U. S., at&para;<br>744. Yet we had no difficulty upholding these require&para;<br>ments there. And much more recently, in Citizens United&para;<br>and Doe v. Reed, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), we followed that&para;<br>precedent. “ ‘Disclosure requirements may burden the&para;<br>ability to speak,” we reasoned, but they “do not prevent&para;<br>anyone from speaking.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (quoting&para;<br>Citizens United, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 51)). So too&para;<br>here. Like a disclosure rule, the matching funds provision&para;<br>may occasionally deter, but “impose[s] no ceiling” on elec&para;<br>toral expression. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 51).&para;<br>The majority breezily dismisses this comparison, label&para;<br>ing the analogy “not even close” because disclosure re&para;<br>quirements result in no payment of money to a speaker’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>opponent. Ante, at 18. That is indeed the factual distinc&para;<br>tion: A matching fund provision, we can all agree, is not a&para;<br>disclosure rule. But the majority does not tell us why this&para;<br>difference matters. Nor could it. The majority strikes&para;<br>down the matching funds provision because of its ostensi&para;<br>ble effect—most notably, that it may deter a person from&para;<br>spending money in an election. But this Court has ac&para;<br>knowledged time and again that disclosure obligations&para;<br>have the selfsame effect. If that consequence does not&para;<br>trigger the most stringent judicial review in the one case,&para;<br>it should not do so in the other.&para;<br>Number three: Any burden that the Arizona law im&para;<br>poses does not exceed the burden associated with contri&para;<br>bution limits, which we have also repeatedly upheld. Con&para;<br>tribution limits, we have stated, “impose direct quantity&para;<br>restrictions on political communication and association,”&para;<br>Buckley, 424 U. S., at 18 (emphasis added), thus “ ‘signifi&para;<br>cant[ly] interfer[ing]’ ” with First Amendment interests,&para;<br>Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377,&para;<br>387 (2000) (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at 25). Rather&para;<br>than potentially deterring or “ ‘diminish[ing] the effective&para;<br>ness’ ” of expressive activity, ante, at 10 (quoting Davis,&para;<br>554 U. S., at 736), these limits stop it cold. Yet we have&para;<br>never subjected these restrictions to the most stringent&para;<br>review. See Buckley, 424 U. S., at 29–38. I doubt I have&para;<br>to reiterate that the Arizona statute imposes no restraints&para;<br>on any expressive activity. So the majority once again has&para;<br>no reason here to reach a different result.&para;<br>In this way, our campaign finance cases join our speech&para;<br>subsidy cases in supporting the constitutionality of Ari&para;<br>zona’s law. Both sets of precedents are in accord that a&para;<br>statute funding electoral speech in the way Arizona’s does&para;<br>imposes no First Amendment injury.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The majority thinks it has one case on its side—Davis v.&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM &para;<br>&para;<br>CLUB PAC v. BENNETT&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Federal Election Comm’n, 554 U. S. 724—and it pegs&para;<br>everything on that decision. See ante, at 9–12. But&para;<br>Davis relies on principles that fit securely within our&para;<br>First Amendment law and tradition—most unlike today’s&para;<br>opinion.&para;<br>As the majority recounts, Davis addressed the constitu&para;<br>tionality of federal legislation known as the Millionaire’s&para;<br>Amendment. Under that provision (which applied in elec&para;<br>tions not involving public financing), a candidate’s expen&para;<br>diture of more than $350,000 of his own money activated a&para;<br>change in applicable contribution limits. Before, each&para;<br>candidate in the race could accept $2,300 from any donor;&para;<br>but now, the opponent of the self-financing candidate&para;<br>could accept three times that much, or up to $6,900 per&para;<br>contributor. So one candidate’s expenditure of personal&para;<br>funds on campaign speech triggered discriminatory con&para;<br>tribution restrictions favoring that candidate’s opponent.&para;<br>Under the First Amendment, the similarity between&para;<br>Davis and this case matters far less than the differences.&para;<br>Here is the similarity: In both cases, one candidate’s cam&para;<br>paign expenditure triggered . . . something. Now here are&para;<br>the differences: In Davis, the candidate’s expenditure&para;<br>triggered a discriminatory speech restriction, which Con&para;<br>gress could not otherwise have imposed consistent with&para;<br>the First Amendment; by contrast, in this case, the candi&para;<br>date’s expenditure triggers a non-discriminatory speech&para;<br>subsidy, which all parties agree Arizona could have pro&para;<br>vided in the first instance. In First Amendment law, that&para;<br>difference makes a difference—indeed, it makes all the&para;<br>difference. As I have indicated before, two great fault&para;<br>lines run through our First Amendment doctrine: one,&para;<br>between speech restrictions and speech subsidies, and the&para;<br>other, between discriminatory and neutral government&para;<br>action. See supra, at 10–11. The Millionaire’s Amend&para;<br>ment fell on the disfavored side of both divides: To reiter&para;<br>ate, it imposed a discriminatory speech restriction.

That decision began,&para;<br>continued, and ended by focusing on the Millionaire&para;<br>Amendment’s “discriminatory contribution limits.” 554&para;<br>U. S., at 740. We made that clear in the very first sen&para;<br>tence of the opinion, where we summarized the question&para;<br>presented. Id., at 728 (“In this appeal, we consider the&para;<br>constitutionality of federal election law provisions that . . .&para;<br>impose different campaign contribution limits on candi&para;<br>dates”). And our focus on the law’s discriminatory restric&para;<br>tions was evident again when we examined how the&para;<br>Court’s prior holdings informed the case. Id., at 738 (“We&para;<br>have never upheld the constitutionality of a law that&para;<br>imposes different contribution limits for candidates”). And&para;<br>then again, when we concluded that the Millionaire’s&para;<br>Amendment could not stand. Id., at 740 (explaining that&para;<br>the “the activation of a scheme of discriminatory contribu&para;<br>tion limits” burdens speech). Our decision left no doubt&para;<br>(because we repeated the point many times over, see also&para;<br>id., at 729, 730, 739, 740, n. 7, 741, 744): The constitu&para;<br>tional problem with the Millionaire’s Amendment lay in&para;<br>its use of discriminatory speech restrictions.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 Of course, only publicly funded candidates receive the subsidy. But&para;<br>that is because only those candidates have agreed to abide by stringent&para;<br>spending caps (which privately funded candidates can exceed by any&para;<br>amount). And Buckley specifically approved that exchange as consis&para;<br>tent with the First Amendment. See 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65, 95. By&para;<br>contrast, Davis involved a scheme in which one candidate in a race&para;<br>received concrete fundraising advantages, in the form of asymmetrical&para;<br>contribution limits, just because his opponent had spent a certain&para;<br>amount of his own money.&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM &para;<br>&para;<br>CLUB PAC v. BENNETT&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>But what of the trigger mechanism—in Davis, as here, a&para;<br>candidate’s campaign expenditures? That, after all, is the&para;<br>only thing that this case and Davis share. If Davis had&para;<br>held that the trigger mechanism itself violated the First&para;<br>Amendment, then the case would support today’s holding.&para;<br>But Davis said nothing of the kind. It made clear that&para;<br>the trigger mechanism could not rescue the discriminatory&para;<br>contribution limits from constitutional invalidity; that the&para;<br>limits went into effect only after a candidate spent sub&para;<br>stantial personal resources rendered them no more per&para;<br>missible under the First Amendment. See id., at 739. But&para;<br>Davis did not call into question the trigger mechanism&para;<br>itself. Indeed, Davis explained that Congress could have&para;<br>used that mechanism to activate a non-discriminatory&para;<br>(i.e., across-the-board) increase in contribution limits; in&para;<br>that case, the Court stated, “Davis’ argument would&para;<br>plainly fail.” Id., at 737.8 The constitutional infirmity in&para;<br>Davis was not the trigger mechanism, but rather what lay&para;<br>on the other side of it—a discriminatory speech restriction.&para;<br>The Court’s response to these points is difficult to&para;<br>fathom. The majority concedes that “our decision in Davis&para;<br>focused on the asymmetrical contribution limits imposed&para;<br>by the Millionaire’s Amendment.” Ante, at 14. That was&para;<br>because, the majority explains, Davis presented only that&para;<br>issue. See ante, at 14. And yet, the majority insists (with&para;<br>out explaining how this can be true), the reach of Davis is&para;<br>not so limited. And in any event, the majority claims, the&para;<br>burden on speech is “greater in this case than in Davis.”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Notably,&para;<br>&para;<br>the Court found this conclusion obvious even though an&para;<br>across-the-board increase in contribution limits works to the compara&para;<br>tive advantage of the non-self-financing candidate—that is, the candi&para;<br>date who actually depends on contributions. Such a system puts the&para;<br>self-financing candidate to a choice: Do I stop spending, or do I allow&para;<br>the higher contribution limits (which will help my opponent) to kick in?&para;<br>That strategic choice parallels the one that the Arizona statute forces.&para;<br>See supra, at 15.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

The burden on speech in Davis—the penalty that cam&para;<br>paign spending triggered—was the discriminatory contri&para;<br>bution restriction, which Congress could not otherwise&para;<br>have imposed. By contrast, the thing triggered here is a&para;<br>non-discriminatory subsidy, of a kind this Court has ap&para;<br>proved for almost four decades. Maybe the majority is&para;<br>saying today that it had something like this case in mind&para;<br>all the time. But nothing in the logic of Davis controls this&para;<br>decision.9&para;<br>III&para;<br>For all these reasons, the Court errs in holding that the&para;<br>government action in this case substantially burdens&para;<br>speech and so requires the State to offer a compelling in&para;<br>terest. But in any event, Arizona has come forward with&para;<br>just such an interest, explaining that the Clean Elections&para;<br>Act attacks corruption and the appearance of corruption in&para;<br>the State’s political system. The majority’s denigration of&para;<br>this interest—the suggestion that it either is not real or&para;<br>does not matter—wrongly prevents Arizona from protect&para;<br>ing the strength and integrity of its democracy.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Our campaign finance precedents leave no doubt: Pre&para;<br>venting corruption or the appearance of corruption is a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The majority also briefly relies on Miami Herald Publishing Co. v.&para;<br>Tornillo, 418 U.

That law, we explained, overrode the newspaper’s own editorial&para;<br>judgment and forced the paper both to pay for and to convey a message&para;<br>with which it disagreed. See id., at 256–258. An analogy might be if&para;<br>Arizona forced privately funded candidates to purchase their opponents’&para;<br>posters, and then to display those posters in their own campaign offices.&para;<br>But that is very far from this case. The Arizona statute does not&para;<br>require petitioners to disseminate or fund any opposing speech; nor&para;<br>does it in any way associate petitioners with that speech.&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM&para;<br>CLUB PAC v.

National Con&para;<br>servative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 496–497&para;<br>(1985) (NCPAC). And so too, these precedents are clear:&para;<br>Public financing of elections serves this interest. See&para;<br>supra, at 4–5. As Buckley recognized, and as I earlier&para;<br>described, public financing “reduce[s] the deleterious&para;<br>influence of large contributions on our political process.”&para;<br>424 U. S., at 91; see id., at 96. When private contributions&para;<br>fuel the political system, candidates may make corrupt&para;<br>bargains to gain the money needed to win election. See&para;<br>NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 497. And voters, seeing the depend&para;<br>ence of candidates on large contributors (or on bundlers of&para;<br>smaller contributions), may lose faith that their represen&para;<br>tatives will serve the public’s interest. See Shrink Mis&para;<br>souri, 528 U. S., at 390 (the “assumption that large donors&para;<br>call the tune [may] jeopardize the willingness of voters to&para;<br>take part in democratic governance”). Public financing&para;<br>addresses these dangers by minimizing the importance of&para;<br>private donors in elections. Even the majority appears to&para;<br>agree with this premise. See ante, at 27 (“We have said&para;<br>that . . . ‘public financing as a means of eliminating the&para;<br>improper influence of large private contributions furthers&para;<br>a significant governmental interest’ ”).&para;<br>This compelling interest appears on the very face of&para;<br>Arizona’s public financing statute. Start with the title:&para;<br>The Citizens Clean Elections Act. Then proceed to the&para;<br>statute’s formal findings. The public financing program,&para;<br>the findings state, was “inten[ded] to create a clean elec&para;<br>tions system that will improve the integrity of Arizona&para;<br>state government by diminishing the influence of special&para;<br>interest money.” §16–940(A) (West 2006). That measure&para;<br>was needed because the prior system of private fundrais&para;<br>ing had “[u]ndermine[d] public confidence in the integrity&para;<br>of public officials;” allowed those officials “to accept large&para;<br>campaign contributions from private interests over which&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>they [had] governmental jurisdiction;” favored “a small&para;<br>number of wealthy special interests” over “the vast major&para;<br>ity of Arizona citizens;” and “[c]os[t] average taxpayers&para;<br>millions of dollars in the form of subsidies and special&para;<br>privileges for campaign contributors.” §16–940(B).10 The&para;<br>State, appearing before us, has reiterated its important&para;<br>anti-corruption interest. The Clean Elections Act, the&para;<br>State avers, “deters quid pro quo corruption and the ap&para;<br>pearance of corruption by providing Arizona candidates&para;<br>with an option to run for office without depending on&para;<br>outside contributions.” Brief for State Respondents 19.&para;<br>And so Arizona, like many state and local governments,&para;<br>has implemented public financing on the theory (which&para;<br>this Court has previously approved, see supra, at 5), that&para;<br>the way to reduce political corruption is to diminish the&para;<br>role of private donors in campaigns.11&para;<br>And that interest justifies the matching funds provision&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 The legislative findings also echo what the Buckley Court found&para;<br>true of public financing—that it “encourage[s] citizen participation in&para;<br>the political process” and “promote[s] freedom of speech” by enhancing&para;<br>the ability of candidates to “communicat[e] to voters.” §§16–940(A), (B).&para;<br>11 The majority briefly suggests that the State’s “austere contribution&para;<br>limits” lessen the need for public financing, see ante, at 26, but provides&para;<br>no support for that dubious claim. As Arizona and other jurisdictions&para;<br>have discovered, contribution limits may not eliminate the risk of&para;<br>corrupt dealing between candidates and donors, especially given the&para;<br>widespread practice of bundling small contributions into large pack&para;<br>ages. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31. For much this&para;<br>reason, Buckley upheld both limits on contributions to federal candi&para;<br>dates and public financing of presidential campaigns. See 424 U. S., at&para;<br>23–38, 90–108. Arizona, like Congress, was “surely entitled to con&para;<br>clude” that contribution limits were only a “partial measure,” id., at 28,&para;<br>and that a functional public financing system was also necessary to&para;<br>eliminate political corruption. In stating otherwise, the Court substi&para;<br>tutes its judgment for that of Arizona’s voters, contrary to our practice&para;<br>of declining to “second-guess a . . . determination as to the need for&para;<br>prophylactic measures where corruption is the evil feared.” Federal&para;<br>Election Comm’n v.

BENNETT&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>at issue because it is a critical facet of Arizona’s public&para;<br>financing program. The provision is no more than a dis&para;<br>bursement mechanism; but it is also the thing that makes&para;<br>the whole Clean Elections Act work. As described earlier,&para;<br>see supra, at 5–6, public financing has an Achilles heel—&para;<br>the difficulty of setting the subsidy at the right amount.&para;<br>Too small, and the grant will not attract candidates to the&para;<br>program; and with no participating candidates, the pro&para;<br>gram can hardly decrease corruption. Too large, and the&para;<br>system becomes unsustainable, or at the least an unneces&para;<br>sary drain on public resources. But finding the sweet-spot&para;<br>is near impossible because of variation, across districts&para;<br>and over time, in the political system. Enter the matching&para;<br>funds provision, which takes an ordinary lump-sum&para;<br>amount, divides it into thirds, and disburses the last two&para;<br>of these (to the extent necessary) via a self-calibrating&para;<br>mechanism. That provision is just a fine-tuning of the&para;<br>lump-sum program approved in Buckley—a fine-tuning, it&para;<br>bears repeating, that prevents no one from speaking and&para;<br>discriminates against no message. But that fine-tuning&para;<br>can make the difference between a wholly ineffectual&para;<br>program and one that removes corruption from the politi&para;<br>cal system.12 If public financing furthers a compelling&para;<br>interest—and according to this Court, it does—then so too&para;<br>does the disbursement formula that Arizona uses to make&para;<br>public financing effective. The one conclusion follows&para;<br>directly from the other.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 For this reason, the majority is quite wrong to say that the State’s&para;<br>interest in combating corruption does not support the matching fund&para;<br>provision’s application to a candidate’s expenditure of his own money or&para;<br>to an independent expenditure. Ante, at 25–26. The point is not that&para;<br>these expenditures themselves corrupt the political process. Rather,&para;<br>Arizona includes these, as well as all other, expenditures in the pro&para;<br>gram to ensure that participating candidates receive the funds neces&para;<br>sary to run competitive races—and so to attract those candidates in the&para;<br>first instance. That is in direct service of the State’s anti-corruption&para;<br>interest.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>27&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Except in this Court, where the inescapable logic of the&para;<br>State’s position is . . . virtually ignored. The Court, to be&para;<br>sure, repeatedly asserts that the State’s interest in pre&para;<br>venting corruption does not “sufficiently justif[y]” the&para;<br>mechanism it has chosen to disburse public moneys. Ante,&para;<br>at 28; see ante, at 27. Only one thing is missing from the&para;<br>Court’s response: any reasoning to support this conclusion.&para;<br>Nowhere does the majority dispute the State’s view that&para;<br>the success of its public financing system depends on the&para;<br>matching funds mechanism; and nowhere does the major&para;<br>ity contest that, if this mechanism indeed spells the differ&para;<br>ence between success and failure, the State’s interest in&para;<br>preventing corruption justifies its use. And so the major&para;<br>ity dismisses, but does not actually answer the State’s&para;<br>contention—even though that contention is the linchpin of&para;<br>the entire case. Assuming (against reason and precedent)&para;<br>that the matching funds provision substantially burdens&para;<br>speech, the question becomes whether the State has of&para;<br>fered a sufficient justification for imposing that burden.&para;<br>Arizona has made a forceful argument on this score,&para;<br>based on the need to establish an effective public fi&para;<br>nancing system. The majority does not even engage that&para;<br>reasoning.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The majority instead devotes most of its energy to trying&para;<br>to show that “level[ing] the playing field,” not fighting&para;<br>corruption, was the State’s real goal. Ante, at 22–23 (in&para;<br>ternal quotation marks omitted); see ante, at 22–24. But&para;<br>the majority’s distaste for “leveling” provides no excuse for&para;<br>striking down Arizona’s law.&para;<br>1&para;<br>For starters, the Court has no basis to question the&para;<br>sincerity of the State’s interest in rooting out political&para;<br>corruption. As I have just explained, that is the interest&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM &para;<br>&para;<br>CLUB PAC v. BENNETT&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>the State has asserted in this Court; it is the interest&para;<br>predominantly expressed in the “findings and declara&para;<br>tions” section of the statute; and it is the interest univer&para;<br>sally understood (stretching back to Teddy Roosevelt’s&para;<br>time) to support public financing of elections. See supra,&para;<br>at 4, 23–24. As against all this, the majority claims to&para;<br>have found three smoking guns that reveal the State’s&para;<br>true (and nefarious) intention to level the playing field.&para;<br>But the only smoke here is the majority’s, and it is the&para;<br>kind that goes with mirrors.&para;<br>The majority first observes that the matching funds&para;<br>provision is titled “ ‘Equal funding of candidates’ ” and that&para;<br>it refers to matching grants as “ ‘equalizing funds.’ ” Ante,&para;<br>at 23 (quoting §16–952). Well, yes. The statute provides&para;<br>for matching funds (above and below certain thresholds); a&para;<br>synonym for “match” is “equal”; and so the statute uses&para;<br>that term. In sum, the statute describes what the statute&para;<br>does. But the relevant question here (according to the&para;<br>majority’s own analysis) is why the statute does that&para;<br>thing—otherwise said, what interest the statute serves.&para;<br>The State explains that its goal is to prevent corruption,&para;<br>and nothing in the Act’s descriptive terms suggests any&para;<br>other objective.&para;<br>Next, the majority notes that the Act allows participat&para;<br>ing candidates to accept private contributions if (but only&para;<br>if) the State cannot provide the funds it has promised (for&para;<br>example, because of a budget crisis). Ante, at 23 (citing&para;<br>§16–954(F)). That provision, the majority argues, shows&para;<br>that when push comes to shove, the State cares more&para;<br>about “leveling” than about fighting corruption. Ante, at&para;<br>23. But this is a plain misreading of the law. All the&para;<br>statute does is assure participating candidates that they&para;<br>will not be left in the lurch if public funds suddenly be&para;<br>come unavailable. That guarantee helps persuade candi&para;<br>dates to enter the program by removing the risk of a state&para;<br>default. And so the provision directly advances the Act’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>29&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>goal of combating corruption.&para;<br>Finally, the Court remarks in a footnote that the Clean&para;<br>Elections Commission’s website once stated that the “ ‘Act&para;<br>was passed by the people of Arizona . . . to level the play&para;<br>ing field.’ ” Ante, at 24, n. 10. I can understand why&para;<br>the majority does not place much emphasis on this point.&para;<br>Some members of the majority have ridiculed the practice&para;<br>of relying on subsequent statements by legislators to&para;<br>demonstrate an earlier Congress’s intent in enacting a&para;<br>statute. See, e.g., Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617,&para;<br>631–632 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part); United&para;<br>States v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415, 434–435 (2009) (ROBERTS,&para;<br>C. J., dissenting). Yet here the majority makes a much&para;<br>stranger claim: that a statement appearing on a govern&para;<br>ment website in 2011 (written by who-knows-whom?)&para;<br>reveals what hundreds of thousands of Arizona’s voters&para;<br>sought to do in 1998 when they enacted the Clean Elec&para;<br>tions Act by referendum. Just to state that proposition is&para;<br>to know it is wrong.&para;<br>So the majority has no evidence—zero, none—that the&para;<br>objective of the Act is anything other than the interest&para;<br>that the State asserts, the Act proclaims, and the history&para;<br>of public financing supports: fighting corruption.&para;<br>2&para;<br>But suppose the majority had come up with some evi&para;<br>dence showing that Arizona had sought to “equalize elec&para;<br>toral opportunities.” Ante, at 24. Would that discovery&para;<br>matter? Our precedent says no, so long as Arizona had a&para;<br>compelling interest in eliminating political corruption&para;<br>(which it clearly did). In these circumstances, any interest&para;<br>of the State in “leveling” should be irrelevant. That inter&para;<br>est could not support Arizona’s law (assuming the law&para;<br>burdened speech), but neither would the interest invali&para;<br>date the legislation.&para;<br>To see the point, consider how the matter might arise.&para;<br>&para;<br>30&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA FREE ENTERPRISE CLUB’S FREEDOM &para;<br>&para;<br>CLUB PAC v. BENNETT&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Assume a State has two reasons to pass a statute affecting&para;<br>speech. It wants to reduce corruption. But in addition,&para;<br>it wishes to “level the playing field.” Under our First&para;<br>Amendment law, the interest in preventing corruption is&para;<br>compelling and may justify restraints on speech. But the&para;<br>interest in “leveling the playing field,” according to well&para;<br>established precedent, cannot support such legislation.13&para;<br>So would this statute (assuming it met all other constitu&para;<br>tional standards) violate the First Amendment?&para;<br>The answer must be no. This Court, after all, has never&para;<br>said that a law restricting speech (or any other constitu&para;<br>tional right) demands two compelling interests. One is&para;<br>enough. And this statute has one: preventing corruption.&para;<br>So it does not matter that equalizing campaign speech is&para;<br>an insufficient interest. The statute could violate the First&para;<br>Amendment only if “equalizing” qualified as a forbidden&para;<br>motive—a motive that itself could annul an otherwise&para;<br>constitutional law. But we have never held that to be so.&para;<br>And that should not be surprising: It is a “fundamental&para;<br>principle of constitutional adjudication,” from which we&para;<br>have deviated only in exceptional cases, “that this Court&para;<br>will not strike down an otherwise constitutional statute on&para;<br>the basis of an alleged illicit legislative motive.” United&para;<br>States v.

When a law is otherwise&para;<br>constitutional—when it either does not restrict speech or&para;<br>rests on an interest sufficient to justify any such restric&para;<br>tion—that is the end of the story.&para;<br>That proposition disposes of this case, even if Arizona&para;<br>had an adjunct interest here in equalizing electoral oppor&para;<br>tunities. No special rule of automatic invalidation applies&para;<br>to statutes having some connection to equality; like any&para;<br>other laws, they pass muster when supported by an im&para;<br>portant enough government interest.

So the hunt for evidence of “leveling” is a&para;<br>waste of time; Arizona’s law survives constitutional scru&para;<br>tiny no matter what that search would uncover.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>This case arose because Arizonans wanted their gov&para;<br>ernment to work on behalf of all the State’s people.

The legislation that&para;<br>Arizona’s voters enacted was the product of deep thought&para;<br>and care. It put into effect a public financing system&para;<br>that attracted large numbers of candidates at a sustain&para;<br>able cost to the State’s taxpayers. The system discrimi&para;<br>nated against no ideas and prevented no speech.
