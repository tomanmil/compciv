Argued November 2, 2009—Decided March 31, 2010&para;<br>After respondent Allstate refused to remit the interest due under New&para;<br>York law on petitioner Shady Grove’s insurance claim, Shady Grove&para;<br>filed this class action in diversity to recover interest Allstate owed it&para;<br>and others. Despite the class action provisions set forth in Federal&para;<br>Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the District Court held itself deprived of&para;<br>jurisdiction by N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. §901(b), which precludes a&para;<br>class action to recover a “penalty” such as statutory interest. Affirm&para;<br>ing, the Second Circuit acknowledged that a Federal Rule adopted in&para;<br>compliance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S.

Since&para;<br>§901(b) attempts to answer the same question, stating that Shady&para;<br>Grove’s suit “may not be maintained as a class action” because of the&para;<br>relief it seeks, that provision cannot apply in diversity suits unless&para;<br>Rule 23 is ultra vires. The Second Circuit’s view that §901(b) and&para;<br>Rule 23 address different issues is rejected. The line between eligibil&para;<br>ity and certifiability is entirely artificial and, in any event, Rule 23&para;<br>explicitly empowers a federal court to certify a class in every case&para;<br>meeting its criteria. Allstate’s arguments based on the exclusion of&para;<br>some federal claims from Rule 23’s reach pursuant to federal statutes&para;<br>and on §901’s structure are unpersuasive. Pp. 4–6.&para;<br>(c) The dissent’s claim that §901(b) can coexist with Rule 23 be&para;<br>cause it addresses only the remedy available to class plaintiffs is&para;<br>foreclosed by §901(b)’s text, notwithstanding its perceived purpose.&para;<br>The principle that courts should read ambiguous Federal Rules to&para;<br>avoid overstepping the authorizing statute, 28 U. S. C. §2072(b), does&para;<br>not apply because Rule 23 is clear. The dissent’s approach does not&para;<br>avoid a conflict between §901(b) and Rule 23 but instead would ren&para;<br>der Rule 23 partially invalid. Pp. 6–12.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE THOMAS, and&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concluded in Parts II–B and II–D:&para;<br>(a) The Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. §2072, not Erie, controls&para;<br>the validity of a Federal Rule of Procedure. Section 2072(b)’s re&para;<br>quirement that federal procedural rules “not abridge, enlarge or mod&para;<br>ify any substantive right” means that a Rule must “really regulat[e]&para;<br>procedure,—the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties rec&para;<br>ognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and&para;<br>redress for disregard or infraction of them,” Sibbach v. Wilson &amp; Co.,&para;<br>312 U. S. 1, 14. Though a Rule may incidentally affect a party’s&para;<br>rights, it is valid so long as it regulates only the process for enforcing&para;<br>those rights, and not the rights themselves, the available remedies,&para;<br>or the rules of decision for adjudicating either. Rule 23 satisfies that&para;<br>criterion, at least insofar as it allows willing plaintiffs to join their&para;<br>separate claims against the same defendants. Allstate’s arguments&para;<br>asserting §901(b)’s substantive impact are unavailing: It is not the&para;<br>substantive or procedural nature of the affected state law that mat&para;<br>ters, but that of the Federal Rule. See, e.g., id., at 14. Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>(b) Opening federal courts to class actions that cannot proceed in&para;<br>state court will produce forum shopping, but that is the inevitable re&para;<br>sult of the uniform system of federal procedure that Congress cre&para;<br>ated.

S., at 13–14. Pp. 16–22.&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS agreed that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23&para;<br>must apply because it governs whether a class must be certified, and&para;<br>it does not violate the Rules Enabling Act in this case. Pp. 1–22.&para;<br>(a) When the application of a federal rule would “abridge,&para;<br>enlarge or modify any substantive right,” 28 U. S. C. §2072(b), the&para;<br>federal rule cannot govern.

Shady Grove tendered a claim for the assigned bene­&para;<br>fits to Allstate, which under New York law had 30 days to&para;<br>pay the claim or deny it. See N. Y. Ins.

The District Court dismissed the suit for&para;<br>lack of jurisdiction. 466 F. Supp. 2d 467 (2006). It rea­&para;<br>soned that N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. §901(b), which pre­&para;<br>cludes a suit to recover a “penalty” from proceeding as a&para;<br>class action, applies in diversity suits in federal court,&para;<br>despite Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. Concluding&para;<br>that statutory interest is a “penalty” under New York law,&para;<br>it held that §901(b) prohibited the proposed class action.&para;<br>And, since Shady Grove conceded that its individual claim&para;<br>(worth roughly $500) fell far short of the amount-in­&para;<br>controversy requirement for individual suits under 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §1332(a), the suit did not belong in federal court.3&para;<br>The Second Circuit affirmed. 549 F. 3d 137 (2008). The&para;<br>court did not dispute that a federal rule adopted in com­&para;<br>pliance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C. §2072,&para;<br>would control if it conflicted with §901(b). But there was&para;<br>no conflict because (as we will describe in more detail&para;<br>below) the Second Circuit concluded that Rule 23 and&para;<br>§901(b) address different issues. Finding no federal rule&para;<br>on point, the Court of Appeals held that §901(b) is “sub­&para;<br>stantive” within the meaning of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,&para;<br>304 U.

Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Shady Grove had asserted jurisdiction under 28 U. S.

If it does, it governs—New York’s law not­&para;<br>withstanding—unless it exceeds statutory authorization or&para;<br>Congress’s rulemaking power. Id., at 5; see Hanna v.&para;<br>Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 463–464 (1965). We do not wade&para;<br>into Erie’s murky waters unless the federal rule is inappli­&para;<br>cable or invalid. See 380 U. S., at 469–471.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The question in dispute is whether Shady Grove’s suit&para;<br>may proceed as a class action. Rule 23 provides an an­&para;<br>swer. It states that “[a] class action may be maintained” if&para;<br>two conditions are met: The suit must satisfy the criteria&para;<br>set forth in subdivision (a) (i.e., numerosity, commonality,&para;<br>typicality, and adequacy of representation), and it also&para;<br>must fit into one of the three categories described in sub­&para;<br>division (b). Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b). By its terms this&para;<br>creates a categorical rule entitling a plaintiff whose suit&para;<br>meets the specified criteria to pursue his claim as a class&para;<br>action. (The Federal Rules regularly use “may” to confer&para;<br>categorical permission, see, e.g., Fed. Rules Civ. Proc.&para;<br>8(d)(2)–(3), 14(a)(1), 18(a)–(b), 20(a)(1)–(2), 27(a)(1),&para;<br>30(a)(1), as do federal statutes that establish procedural&para;<br>entitlements, see, e.g., 29 U. S. C. §626(c)(1); 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2000e–5(f)(1).) Thus, Rule 23 provides a one-size-fits-all&para;<br>formula for deciding the class-action question. Because&para;<br>§901(b) attempts to answer the same question—i.e., it&para;<br>states that Shady Grove’s suit “may not be maintained as&para;<br>a class action” (emphasis added) because of the relief it&para;<br>seeks—it cannot apply in diversity suits unless Rule 23 is&para;<br>ultra vires.&para;<br>The Second Circuit believed that §901(b) and Rule 23 do&para;<br>not conflict because they address different issues. Rule 23,&para;<br>it said, concerns only the criteria for determining whether&para;<br>a given class can and should be certified; section 901(b), on&para;<br>the other hand, addresses an antecedent question:&para;<br>whether the particular type of claim is eligible for class&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

See 549 F. 3d, at 143–144. Allstate embraces&para;<br>this analysis. Brief for Respondent 12–13.&para;<br>We disagree. To begin with, the line between eligibility&para;<br>and certifiability is entirely artificial. Both are precondi­&para;<br>tions for maintaining a class action. Allstate suggests that&para;<br>eligibility must depend on the “particular cause of action”&para;<br>asserted, instead of some other attribute of the suit, id., at&para;<br>12. But that is not so. Congress could, for example, pro­&para;<br>vide that only claims involving more than a certain num­&para;<br>ber of plaintiffs are “eligible” for class treatment in federal&para;<br>court. In other words, relabeling Rule 23(a)’s prerequi­&para;<br>sites “eligibility criteria” would obviate Allstate’s objec­&para;<br>tion—a sure sign that its eligibility-certifiability distinc­&para;<br>tion is made-to-order.&para;<br>There is no reason, in any event, to read Rule 23 as&para;<br>addressing only whether claims made eligible for class&para;<br>treatment by some other law should be certified as class&para;<br>actions. Allstate asserts that Rule 23 neither explicitly&para;<br>nor implicitly empowers a federal court “to certify a class&para;<br>in each and every case” where the Rule’s criteria are met.&para;<br>Id., at 13–14. But that is exactly what Rule 23 does: It&para;<br>says that if the prescribed preconditions are satisfied “[a]&para;<br>class action may be maintained” (emphasis added)—not “a&para;<br>class action may be permitted.” Courts do not maintain&para;<br>actions; litigants do. The discretion suggested by Rule 23’s&para;<br>“may” is discretion residing in the plaintiff: He may bring&para;<br>his claim in a class action if he wishes. And like the rest&para;<br>of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23 automati&para;<br>cally applies “in all civil actions and proceedings in the&para;<br>United States district courts,” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1. See&para;<br>Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 699–700 (1979).&para;<br>Allstate points out that Congress has carved out some&para;<br>federal claims from Rule 23’s reach, see, e.g., 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1252(e)(1)(B)—which shows, Allstate contends, that Rule&para;<br>23 does not authorize class actions for all claims, but&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.&para;<br>v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.&para;<br>CALIA&para;<br>, J.&para;<br>Opinion of S&para;<br>the&para;<br>Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rather leaves room for laws like §901(b). But Congress,&para;<br>unlike New York, has ultimate authority over the Federal&para;<br>Rules of Civil Procedure; it can create exceptions to an&para;<br>individual rule as it sees fit—either by directly amending&para;<br>the rule or by enacting a separate statute overriding it in&para;<br>certain instances. Cf. Henderson v. United States, 517&para;<br>U. S. 654, 668 (1996). The fact that Congress has created&para;<br>specific exceptions to Rule 23 hardly proves that the Rule&para;<br>does not apply generally. In fact, it proves the opposite. If&para;<br>Rule 23 did not authorize class actions across the board,&para;<br>the statutory exceptions would be unnecessary.&para;<br>Allstate next suggests that the structure of §901 shows&para;<br>that Rule 23 addresses only certifiability. Section 901(a),&para;<br>it notes, establishes class-certification criteria roughly&para;<br>analogous to those in Rule 23 (wherefore it agrees that&para;<br>subsection is pre-empted). But §901(b)’s rule barring class&para;<br>actions for certain claims is set off as its own subsection,&para;<br>and where it applies §901(a) does not. This shows, accord­&para;<br>ing to Allstate, that §901(b) concerns a separate subject.&para;<br>Perhaps it does concern a subject separate from the sub­&para;<br>ject of §901(a). But the question before us is whether it&para;<br>concerns a subject separate from the subject of Rule 23—&para;<br>and for purposes of answering that question the way New&para;<br>York has structured its statute is immaterial. Rule 23&para;<br>permits all class actions that meet its requirements, and a&para;<br>State cannot limit that permission by structuring one part&para;<br>of its statute to track Rule 23 and enacting another part&para;<br>that imposes additional requirements. Both of §901’s&para;<br>subsections undeniably answer the same question as Rule&para;<br>23: whether a class action may proceed for a given suit.&para;<br>Cf. Burlington, 480 U. S., at 7–8.&para;<br>The dissent argues that §901(b) has nothing to do with&para;<br>whether Shady Grove may maintain its suit as a class&para;<br>action, but affects only the remedy it may obtain if it wins.&para;<br>See post, at 8–17 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.).

Accordingly, the dissent says,&para;<br>Rule 23 and New York’s law may coexist in peace.&para;<br>We need not decide whether a state law that limits the&para;<br>remedies available in an existing class action would con­&para;<br>flict with Rule 23; that is not what §901(b) does. By its&para;<br>terms, the provision precludes a plaintiff from “main­&para;<br>tain[ing]” a class action seeking statutory penalties.&para;<br>Unlike a law that sets a ceiling on damages (or puts other&para;<br>remedies out of reach) in properly filed class actions,&para;<br>§901(b) says nothing about what remedies a court may&para;<br>award; it prevents the class actions it covers from coming&para;<br>into existence at all.4 Consequently, a court bound by&para;<br>§901(b) could not certify a class action seeking both statu­&para;<br>tory penalties and other remedies even if it announces in&para;<br>advance that it will refuse to award the penalties in the&para;<br>event the plaintiffs prevail; to do so would violate the&para;<br>statute’s clear prohibition on “maintain[ing]” such suits as&para;<br>class actions.&para;<br>The dissent asserts that a plaintiff can avoid §901(b)’s&para;<br>barrier by omitting from his complaint (or removing) a&para;<br>request for statutory penalties. See post, at 14–15. Even&para;<br>assuming all statutory penalties are waivable,5 the fact&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Contrary to the dissent’s implication, post, at 13, we express no view&para;<br>as to whether state laws that set a ceiling on damages recoverable in a&para;<br>single suit, see App. A to Brief for Respondent, are pre-empted.&para;<br>Whether or not those laws conflict with Rule 23, §901(b) does conflict&para;<br>because it addresses not the remedy, but the procedural right to main­&para;<br>tain a class action. As Allstate and the dissent note, several federal&para;<br>statutes also limit the recovery available in class actions. See, e.g., 12&para;<br>U. S. C. §2605(f)(2)(B); 15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)(B); 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1854(c)(1).

Likewise, we have upheld rules au­&para;<br>thorizing imposition of sanctions upon those who file&para;<br>frivolous appeals, see Burlington, supra, at 8 (Fed.

Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc., 498&para;<br>U. S. 533, 551–554 (1991) (Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11). Each&para;<br>of these rules had some practical effect on the parties’&para;<br>rights, but each undeniably regulated only the process for&para;<br>enforcing those rights; none altered the rights themselves,&para;<br>the available remedies, or the rules of decision by which&para;<br>the court adjudicated either.&para;<br>Applying that criterion, we think it obvious that rules&para;<br>allowing multiple claims (and claims by or against multi­&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

Proc. 18 (joinder of claims), 20 (joinder&para;<br>of parties), 42(a) (consolidation of actions). Such rules&para;<br>neither change plaintiffs’ separate entitlements to relief&para;<br>nor abridge defendants’ rights; they alter only how the&para;<br>claims are processed. For the same reason, Rule 23—at&para;<br>least insofar as it allows willing plaintiffs to join their&para;<br>separate claims against the same defendants in a class&para;<br>action—falls within §2072(b)’s authorization. A class&para;<br>action, no less than traditional joinder (of which it is a&para;<br>species), merely enables a federal court to adjudicate&para;<br>claims of multiple parties at once, instead of in separate&para;<br>suits. And like traditional joinder, it leaves the parties’&para;<br>legal rights and duties intact and the rules of decision&para;<br>unchanged.&para;<br>Allstate contends that the authorization of class actions&para;<br>is not substantively neutral: Allowing Shady Grove to sue&para;<br>on behalf of a class “transform[s] [the] dispute over a five&para;<br>hundred dollar penalty into a dispute over a five million&para;<br>dollar penalty.” Brief for Respondent 1. Allstate’s aggre­&para;<br>gate liability, however, does not depend on whether the&para;<br>suit proceeds as a class action. Each of the 1,000-plus&para;<br>members of the putative class could (as Allstate acknowl­&para;<br>edges) bring a freestanding suit asserting his individual&para;<br>claim. It is undoubtedly true that some plaintiffs who&para;<br>would not bring individual suits for the relatively small&para;<br>sums involved will choose to join a class action. That has&para;<br>no bearing, however, on Allstate’s or the plaintiffs’ legal&para;<br>rights. The likelihood that some (even many) plaintiffs&para;<br>will be induced to sue by the availability of a class action&para;<br>is just the sort of “incidental effec[t]” we have long held&para;<br>does not violate §2072(b), Mississippi Publishing, supra,&para;<br>at 445.&para;<br>Allstate argues that Rule 23 violates §2072(b) because&para;<br>the state law it displaces, §901(b), creates a right that&para;<br>the Federal Rule abridges—namely, a “substantive&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Brief for Respondent 31. To&para;<br>begin with, we doubt that that is so. Nothing in the text of&para;<br>§901(b) (which is to be found in New York’s procedural&para;<br>code) confines it to claims under New York law; and of&para;<br>course New York has no power to alter substantive rights&para;<br>and duties created by other sovereigns. As we have said,&para;<br>the consequence of excluding certain class actions may be&para;<br>to cap the damages a defendant can face in a single suit,&para;<br>but the law itself alters only procedure. In that respect,&para;<br>§901(b) is no different from a state law forbidding simple&para;<br>joinder. As a fallback argument, Allstate argues that even&para;<br>if §901(b) is a procedural provision, it was enacted “for&para;<br>substantive reasons,” id., at 24 (emphasis added). Its end&para;<br>was not to improve “the conduct of the litigation process&para;<br>itself” but to alter “the outcome of that process.” Id., at 26.&para;<br>The fundamental difficulty with both these arguments is&para;<br>that the substantive nature of New York’s law, or its&para;<br>substantive purpose, makes no difference. A Federal Rule&para;<br>of Procedure is not valid in some jurisdictions and invalid&para;<br>in others—or valid in some cases and invalid in others—&para;<br>depending upon whether its effect is to frustrate a state&para;<br>substantive law (or a state procedural law enacted for&para;<br>substantive purposes). That could not be clearer in&para;<br>Sibbach:&para;<br>“The petitioner says the phrase [‘substantive rights’ in&para;<br>the Rules Enabling Act] connotes more; that by its use&para;<br>Congress intended that in regulating procedure this&para;<br>Court should not deal with important and substantial&para;<br>rights theretofore recognized.

A state procedural rule is not pre­&para;<br>empted, according to the concurrence, so long&para;<br>as it is “so bound up with,” or “sufficiently intertwined&para;<br>with,” a substantive state-law right or remedy “that it&para;<br>defines the scope of that substantive right or remedy,”&para;<br>post, at 4, 13.&para;<br>This analysis squarely conflicts with Sibbach, which&para;<br>established the rule we apply.

It is&para;<br>clear from the context, however, that this passage referred to the Erie&para;<br>prohibition of court-created rules that displace state law. The opinion&para;<br>unquestionably dealt with the Federal Rules’ compliance with §2072(b),&para;<br>and it adopted the standard we apply here to resolve the question,&para;<br>which does not depend on whether individual applications of the Rule&para;<br>abridge or modify state-law rights. See 312 U. S., at 13–14. To the&para;<br>extent Sibbach did not address the Federal Rules’ validity vis-à-vis&para;<br>contrary state law, Hanna surely did, see 380 U.

Post, at 13, n. 13. This mistakes what&para;<br>the Federal Rule regulates for its incidental effects. As we have ex­&para;<br>plained, supra, at 12–13, most Rules have some effect on litigants’&para;<br>substantive rights or their ability to obtain a remedy, but that does not&para;<br>mean the Rule itself regulates those rights or remedies.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

In any event,&para;<br>the concurrence’s account of our shunning of Sibbach is greatly exag­&para;<br>gerated. Hanna did not merely cite the case, but recognized it as&para;<br>establishing the governing rule. 380 U. S., at 464–465, 470–471.&para;<br>Mississippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U. S. 438, 445–446&para;<br>(1946), likewise cited Sibbach and applied the same test, examining the&para;<br>Federal Rule, not the state law it displaced. True, Burlington Northern&para;<br>R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1 (1987), and for that matter Business&para;<br>Guides, Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc., 498 U. S.&para;<br>533 (1991), did not cite Sibbach. But both cited and followed Hanna—&para;<br>which as noted held out Sibbach as setting forth the governing rule.&para;<br>See Burlington Northern, supra, at 5–6, 8; Business Guides, supra, at&para;<br>552–554. Thus, while Sibbach itself may appear infrequently in the&para;<br>U. S.

Nor does it cast doubt on Sibbach’s&para;<br>straightforward test: As the concurrence notes, Hanna cited Sibbach for&para;<br>that statement, 380 U. S., at 473, showing it saw no inconsistency&para;<br>between the two.&para;<br>13 The concurrence is correct, post, at 10, n. 9, that under our disposi­&para;<br>tion any rule that “really regulates procedure,” Sibbach, supra, at 14,&para;<br>will pre-empt a conflicting state rule, however “bound up” the latter is&para;<br>with substantive law. The concurrence is wrong, however, that that&para;<br>result proves our interpretation of §2072(b) implausible, post, at 10,&para;<br>n. 9. The result is troubling only if one stretches the term “substantive&para;<br>rights” in §2072(b) to mean not only state-law rights themselves, but&para;<br>also any state-law procedures closely connected to them. Neither the&para;<br>text nor our precedent supports that expansive interpretation. The&para;<br>examples the concurrence offers—statutes of limitations, burdens of&para;<br>proof, and standards for appellate review of damages awards—do not&para;<br>make its broad definition of substantive rights more persuasive. They&para;<br>merely illustrate that in rare cases it may be difficult to determine&para;<br>whether a rule “really regulates” procedure or substance. If one con­&para;<br>cludes the latter, there is no pre-emption of the state rule; the Federal&para;<br>Rule itself is invalid.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

But as the concurrence ac­&para;<br>knowledges, post, at 11, the basic difficulty is unavoidable:&para;<br>The statute itself refers to “substantive right[s],” §2072(b),&para;<br>so there is no escaping the substance-procedure distinc­&para;<br>tion. What is more, the concurrence’s approach does&para;<br>nothing to diminish the difficulty, but rather magnifies it&para;<br>many times over.

At the end of the day, one&para;<br>must come face to face with the decision whether or not&para;<br>the state policy (with which a putatively procedural state&para;<br>rule may be “bound up”) pertains to a “substantive right or&para;<br>remedy,” post, at 19—that is, whether it is substance or&para;<br>procedure.15 The more one explores the alternatives to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>The concurrence’s concern would make more sense if many Federal&para;<br>Rules that effectively alter state-law rights “bound up with procedures”&para;<br>would survive under Sibbach.

At both steps&para;<br>of the inquiry, there is a critical question about what the&para;<br>state law and the federal rule mean.&para;<br>The court must first determine whether the scope of the&para;<br>federal rule is “ ‘sufficiently broad’ ” to “ ‘control the issue’ ”&para;<br>before the court, “thereby leaving no room for the opera&para;<br>tion” of seemingly conflicting state law. See Burlington&para;<br>Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4–5 (1987); Walker&para;<br>v. Armco Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 749–750, and n. 9&para;<br>(1980). If the federal rule does not apply or can operate&para;<br>alongside the state rule, then there is no “Ac[t] of Con&para;<br>gress” governing that particular question, 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1652, and the court must engage in the traditional Rules&para;<br>of Decision Act inquiry under Erie and its progeny. In&para;<br>some instances, the “plain meaning” of a federal rule will&para;<br>not come into “ ‘direct collision’ ” with the state law, and&para;<br>both can operate. Walker, 446 U. S., at 750, n. 9, 749. In&para;<br>other instances, the rule “when fairly construed,” Burling&para;<br>ton Northern R. Co., 480 U.

Indeed, the mandate that&para;<br>federal rules “shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any&para;<br>substantive right” evinces the opposite intent, as does&para;<br>Congress’ decision to delegate the creation of rules to this&para;<br>Court rather than to a political branch, see 19 C. Wright,&para;<br>A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure&para;<br>§4509, p. 265 (2d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Wright).&para;<br>Thus, the second step of the inquiry may well bleed back&para;<br>into the first. When a federal rule appears to abridge,&para;<br>enlarge, or modify a substantive right, federal courts must&para;<br>consider whether the rule can reasonably be interpreted to&para;<br>avoid that impermissible result. See, e.g., Semtek Int’l Inc.&para;<br>v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U.

See 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2072(b) (mandating that federal rules “shall not” alter&para;<br>“any substantive right” (emphasis added)); Hanna, 380&para;<br>U.

I respectfully disagree.7&para;<br>This interpretation of the Enabling Act is consonant with&para;<br>the Act’s first limitation to “general rules of practice and&para;<br>procedure,” §2072(a). But it ignores the second limitation&para;<br>that such rules also “not abridge, enlarge or modify any&para;<br>substantive right,” §2072(b) (emphasis added),8 and in so&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 This&para;<br>&para;<br>understanding of the Enabling Act has been the subject of sub&para;<br>stantial academic criticism, and rightfully so. See, e.g., Wright §4509,&para;<br>at 264, 269–270, 272; Ely, The Irrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv.&para;<br>L. Rev. 693, 719 (1974) (hereinafter Ely); see also R. Fallon, J. Man&para;<br>ning, D. Meltzer, &amp; D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler’s, The Federal&para;<br>Courts and the Federal System 593, n. 6 (6th ed. 2009) (discussing Ely).&para;<br>8 JUSTICE SCALIA concedes as much, see ante, at 18–19, but argues&para;<br>that insofar as I allow for the possibility that a federal rule might&para;<br>violate the Enabling Act when it displaces a seemingly procedural state&para;<br>rule, my approach is itself “unfaithful to the statute’s terms,” which&para;<br>cover “substantive rights” but not “procedural rules,” ante, at 19, n. 11&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). This is not an objection to my&para;<br>interpretation of the Enabling Act—that courts must look to whether a&para;<br>federal rule alters substantive rights in a given case—but simply to the&para;<br>way I would apply it, allowing for the possibility that a state rule that&para;<br>regulates something traditionally considered to be procedural might&para;<br>actually define a substantive right. JUSTICE SCALIA’s objection, more&para;<br>over, misses the key point: In some instances, a state rule that appears&para;<br>procedural really is not. A rule about how damages are reviewed on&para;<br>appeal may really be a damages cap. See Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 427.&para;<br>A rule that a plaintiff can bring a claim for only three years may really&para;<br>be a limit on the existence of the right to seek redress.

It also ig&para;<br>nores the separation-of-powers presumption, see Wright&para;<br>§4509, at 265, and federalism presumption, see Wyeth, 555&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8), that counsel against judicially&para;<br>created rules displacing state substantive law.9&para;<br>——————&para;<br>one might describe as “procedural,” but they nonetheless define sub&para;<br>stantive rights. Thus, if a federal rule displaced such a state rule, the&para;<br>federal rule would have altered the State’s “substantive rights.”&para;<br>9 The plurality’s interpretation of the Enabling Act appears to mean&para;<br>that no matter how bound up a state provision is with the State’s own&para;<br>rights or remedies, any contrary federal rule that happens to regulate&para;<br>“the manner and the means by which the litigants’ rights are enforced,”&para;<br>ante, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), must govern. There are&para;<br>many ways in which seemingly procedural rules may displace a State’s&para;<br>formulation of its substantive law. For example, statutes of limitations,&para;<br>although in some sense procedural rules, can also be understood as a&para;<br>temporal limitation on legally created rights; if this Court were to&para;<br>promulgate a federal limitations period, federal courts would still, in&para;<br>some instances, be required to apply state limitations periods. Simi&para;<br>larly, if the federal rules altered the burden of proof in a case, this could&para;<br>eviscerate a critical aspect—albeit one that deals with how a right is&para;<br>enforced—of a State’s framework of rights and remedies. Or if a federal&para;<br>rule about appellate review displaced a state rule about how damages&para;<br>are reviewed on appeal, the federal rule might be pre-empting a state&para;<br>damages cap. Cf. Gasperini, 518 U. S., at 427.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA responds that some of these federal rules might be&para;<br>invalid under his view of the Enabling Act because they may not “really&para;<br>regulat[e] procedure.” Ante, at 20, n. 13 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). This response, of course, highlights how empty the plurality’s&para;<br>test really is. See n. 10, infra. The response is also limited to those&para;<br>rules that can be described as “regulat[ing]” substance, ante, at 13; it&para;<br>does not address those federal rules that alter the right at issue in the&para;<br>litigation, see Sibbach v. Wilson &amp; Co., 312 U. S. 1, 13–14 (1941), only&para;<br>when they displace particular state laws. JUSTICE SCALIA speculates&para;<br>that “Congress may well have accepted” the occasional alteration of&para;<br>substantive rights “as the price of a uniform system of federal proce&para;<br>dure.” Ante, at 20–21, n. 13.

First, JUSTICE SCALIA worries that if fed&para;<br>eral courts inquire into the effect of federal rules on state&para;<br>law, it will enmesh federal courts in difficult determina&para;<br>tions about whether application of a given rule would&para;<br>displace a state determination about substantive rights.&para;<br>See ante, at 15, 21–22, and nn. 14, 15. I do not see why an&para;<br>Enabling Act inquiry that looks to state law necessarily is&para;<br>more taxing than JUSTICE SCALIA’s.10 But in any event,&para;<br>that inquiry is what the Enabling Act requires: While it&para;<br>may not be easy to decide what is actually a “substantive&para;<br>right,” “the designations substantive and procedural be&para;<br>come important, for the Enabling Act has made them so.”&para;<br>Ely 723; see also Wright §4509, at 266. The question,&para;<br>therefore, is not what rule we think would be easiest on&para;<br>federal courts. The question is what rule Congress estab&para;<br>lished. Although, JUSTICE SCALIA may generally prefer&para;<br>easily administrable, bright-line rules, his preference does&para;<br>not give us license to adopt a second-best interpretation of&para;<br>the Rules Enabling Act. Courts cannot ignore text and&para;<br>——————&para;<br>“shall not” alter “any” substantive right. §2072(b).&para;<br>10 It will be rare that a federal rule that is facially valid under 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2072 will displace a State’s definition of its own substantive&para;<br>rights. See Wright §4509, at 272 (observing that “unusual cases&para;<br>occasionally might arise in which . . . because of an unorthodox state&para;<br>rule of law, application of a Civil Rule . . . would intrude upon state&para;<br>substantive rights”). JUSTICE SCALIA’s interpretation, moreover, is not&para;<br>much more determinative than mine. Although it avoids courts’ having&para;<br>to evaluate state law, it tasks them with figuring out whether a federal&para;<br>rule is really “procedural.” It is hard to know the answer to that&para;<br>question and especially hard to resolve it without considering the&para;<br>nature and functions of the state law that the federal rule will displace.&para;<br>The plurality’s “ ‘test’ is no test at all—in a sense, it is little more than&para;<br>the statement that a matter is procedural if, by revelation, it is proce&para;<br>dural.” Id., §4509, at 264.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

But the plurality&para;<br>misreads that opinion. As Justice Harlan observed in&para;<br>Hanna, “shorthand formulations which have appeared in&para;<br>earlier opinions are prone to carry untoward results that&para;<br>frequently arise from oversimplification.” 380 U. S., at&para;<br>475 (concurring opinion). To understand Sibbach, it is&para;<br>first necessary to understand the issue that was before the&para;<br>Court. The petitioner raised only the facial question&para;<br>whether “Rules 35 and 37 [of the Federal Rules of Civil&para;<br>Procedure] are . . . within the mandate of Congress to this&para;<br>court” and not the specific question of “the obligation of&para;<br>federal courts to apply the substantive law of a state.”11&para;<br>312 U. S., at 9. The Court, therefore, had no occasion to&para;<br>consider whether the particular application of the Federal&para;<br>Rules in question would offend the Enabling Act.12&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 The petitioner in Sibbach argued only that federal rules could not&para;<br>validly address subjects involving “important questions of policy,” Supp.&para;<br>Brief of Petitioner, O. T. 1940, No. 28, p. 7; see also Reply to Brief of&para;<br>Respondent, O. T. 1940, No. 28, p. 2 (summarizing that the petitioner&para;<br>argued only that “[t]he right not to be compelled to submit to a physical&para;<br>examination” is “a ‘substantive’ right forbidden by Congress” to be&para;<br>addressed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, “even though in&para;<br>theory the right is not of the character determinative of litigation”). In&para;<br>the petitioner’s own words, “[t]his contention. . . [did] not in itself&para;<br>involve the [applicable] law of Illinois,” ibid., and the petitioner in her&para;<br>briefing referenced the otherwise applicable state law only “to show&para;<br>that [she] was in a position to make the contention,” ibid., that is, to&para;<br>show that the federal court was applying a federal rule and not, under&para;<br>the Rules of Decision Act, applying state law, see id., at 3.&para;<br>12 The plurality defends its view by including a long quote from two&para;<br>paragraphs of Sibbach. Ante, at 15–16. But the quoted passage of&para;<br>Sibbach describes only a facial inquiry into whether federal rules may&para;<br>“deal with” particular subject matter. 312 U. S., at 13. The plurality’s&para;<br>block quote, moreover, omits half of one of the quoted paragraphs, in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Nor, in Sibbach, was any further analysis necessary to&para;<br>the resolution of the case because the matter at issue,&para;<br>requiring medical exams for litigants, did not pertain to&para;<br>“substantive rights” under the Enabling Act. Although&para;<br>most state rules bearing on the litigation process are&para;<br>adopted for some policy reason, few seemingly “proce&para;<br>dural” rules define the scope of a substantive right or&para;<br>remedy. The matter at issue in Sibbach reflected compet&para;<br>ing federal and state judgments about privacy interests.&para;<br>Those privacy concerns may have been weighty and in&para;<br>some sense substantive; but they did not pertain to the&para;<br>scope of any state right or remedy at issue in the litiga&para;<br>tion. Thus, in response to the petitioner’s argument in&para;<br>Sibbach that “substantive rights” include not only “rights&para;<br>sought to be adjudicated by the litigants” but also “general&para;<br>principle[s]” or “question[s] of public policy that the legis&para;<br>lature is able to pass upon,” id., at 2–3, we held that “the&para;<br>phrase ‘substantive rights’ ” embraces only state rights,&para;<br>such as the tort law in that case, that are sought to be&para;<br>enforced in the judicial proceedings. Id., at 13–14. If the&para;<br>Federal Rule had in fact displaced a state rule that was&para;<br>sufficiently intertwined with a state right or remedy, then&para;<br>perhaps the Enabling Act analysis would have been differ&para;<br>ent.13 Our subsequent cases are not to the contrary.14&para;<br>——————&para;<br>which the Court explained that the term “substantive rights” in the&para;<br>Enabling Act “certainly embraces such rights” as “rights conferred by&para;<br>law to be protected and enforced,” such as “the right not to be injured in&para;<br>one’s person by another’s negligence” and “to redress [such] infraction.”&para;<br>Ibid. But whether a federal rule, for example, enlarges the right “to&para;<br>redress [an] infraction,” will depend on the state law that it displaces.&para;<br>13 Put another way, even if a federal rule in most cases “really regu&para;<br>lates procedure,” Sibbach, 312 U. S., at 14, it does not “really regulat[e]&para;<br>procedure” when it displaces those rare state rules that, although&para;<br>“procedural” in the ordinary sense of the term, operate to define the&para;<br>rights and remedies available in a case. This is so because what is&para;<br>procedural in one context may be substantive in another. See Hanna,&para;<br>380 U. S., at 471; Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, 108 (1945).&para;<br>14 Although this Court’s decision in Hanna cited Sibbach, that is of&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.&para;<br>v. ALLSTATE INS.

Post, at 12. As explained above, I&para;<br>readily acknowledge that if a federal rule displaces a state&para;<br>rule that is “ ‘procedural’ in the ordinary sense of the&para;<br>term,” S. A. Healy Co., 60 F. 3d, at 310, but sufficiently&para;<br>interwoven with the scope of a substantive right or rem&para;<br>edy, there would be an Enabling Act problem, and the&para;<br>federal rule would have to give way. In my view, however,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>little significance. Hanna did not hold that any seemingly procedural&para;<br>federal rule will always govern, even when it alters a substantive state&para;<br>right; nor, as in Sibbach, was the argument that I now make before the&para;<br>Court. Indeed, in Hanna we cited Sibbach’s statement that the Ena&para;<br>bling Act prohibits federal rules that alter the rights to be adjudicated&para;<br>by the litigants, 312 U. S., at 13–14, for the proposition that “a court, in&para;<br>measuring a Federal Rule against the standards contained in the&para;<br>Enabling Act . . . need not wholly blind itself to the degree to which the&para;<br>Rule makes the character and result of the federal litigation stray from&para;<br>the course it would follow in state courts,” 380 U. S., at 473. And most&para;<br>of our subsequent decisions that have squarely addressed the frame&para;<br>work for applying federal rules in diversity cases have not mentioned&para;<br>Sibbach at all but cited only Hanna.

But in that case, we contemplated only that the&para;<br>Federal Rule in question might have “incidental effects . . . upon the&para;<br>rights of litigants,” explaining that “[t]he fact that the application of&para;<br>Rule 4(f) will operate to subject petitioner’s rights to adjudication by&para;<br>the district court for northern Mississippi” rather than southern Mis&para;<br>sissippi “will undoubtedly affect those rights.” 326 U.

Rule&para;<br>23, therefore, must apply unless its application would&para;<br>abridge, enlarge, or modify New York rights or remedies.&para;<br>Notwithstanding the plain language of Rule 23, I under&para;<br>stand the dissent to find that Rule 23 does not govern the&para;<br>question of class certification in this matter because New&para;<br>York has made a substantive judgment that such a class&para;<br>should not be certified, as a means of proscribing damages.&para;<br>Although, as discussed infra, at 17–20, I do not accept the&para;<br>dissent’s view of §901(b), I also do not see how the dis&para;<br>sent’s interpretation of Rule 23 follows from that view.15 I&para;<br>——————&para;<br>15 Nor do I see how it follows from the dissent’s premises that a class&para;<br>cannot be certified. The dissent contends that §901(b) is a damages&para;<br>“limitation,” post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12, 25, or “proscription,” post, at 12,&para;<br>n. 6, 21, whereas Rule 23 “does not command that a particular remedy&para;<br>be available when a party sues in a representative capacity,” post, at&para;<br>11, and that consequently both provisions can apply. Yet even if the&para;<br>dissent’s premises were correct, Rule 23 would still control the question&para;<br>whether petitioner may certify a class, and §901(b) would be relevant&para;<br>only to determine whether petitioner, at the conclusion of a class-action&para;<br>lawsuit, may collect statutory damages.&para;<br>It may be that if the dissent’s interpretation of §901(b) were correct,&para;<br>this class could not (or has not) alleged sufficient damages for the&para;<br>federal court to have jurisdiction, see 28 U. S. C. §1332(d)(6). But that&para;<br>issue was not raised in respondent’s motion to dismiss (from which the&para;<br>case comes to this Court), and it was not squarely presented to the&para;<br>Court. In any event, although the lead plaintiff has “acknowledged&para;<br>that its individual claim” is for less than the required amount in&para;<br>controversy, see 549 F. 3d 137, 140 (CA2 2008), we do not know what&para;<br>actual damages the entire class can allege. Thus, even if the Court&para;<br>were to adopt all of the dissent’s premises, I believe the correct disposi&para;<br>tion would be to vacate and remand for further consideration of&para;<br>whether the required amount in controversy has or can be met.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

But that is&para;<br>not what the dissent has done. Simply because a rule&para;<br>should be read in light of federalism concerns, it does not&para;<br>follow that courts may rewrite the rule.&para;<br>At bottom, the dissent’s interpretation of Rule 23 seems&para;<br>to be that Rule 23 covers only those cases in which its&para;<br>application would create no Erie problem. The dissent&para;<br>would apply the Rules of Decision Act inquiry under Erie&para;<br>even to cases in which there is a governing federal rule,&para;<br>and thus the Act, by its own terms, does not apply. But&para;<br>“[w]hen a situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules,&para;<br>the question facing the court is a far cry from the typical,&para;<br>relatively unguided Erie choice.” Hanna, 380 U.

Although it reflects a laudable concern to pro&para;<br>tect “state regulatory policies,” post, at 5 (internal quota&para;<br>tion marks omitted), JUSTICE GINSBURG’s approach would,&para;<br>in my view, work an end run around Congress’ system of&para;<br>uniform federal rules, see 28 U.

Federal courts can and should interpret&para;<br>federal rules with sensitivity to “state prerogatives,” post,&para;<br>at 4; but even when “state interests . . . warrant our re&para;<br>spectful consideration,” post, at 8, federal courts cannot&para;<br>rewrite the rules. If my dissenting colleagues feel strongly&para;<br>that §901(b) is substantive and that class certification&para;<br>should be denied, then they should argue within the Ena&para;<br>bling Act’s framework.

This inquiry is not always a simple one because&para;<br>“[i]t is difficult to conceive of any rule of procedure that&para;<br>cannot have a significant effect on the outcome of a case,”&para;<br>Wright §4508, at 232–233, and almost “any rule can be&para;<br>said to have . . . ‘substantive effects,’ affecting society’s&para;<br>distribution of risks and rewards,” Ely 724, n. 170. Faced&para;<br>with a federal rule that dictates an answer to a tradition&para;<br>ally procedural question and that displaces a state rule,&para;<br>one can often argue that the state rule was really some&para;<br>part of the State’s definition of its rights or remedies.&para;<br>In my view, however, the bar for finding an Enabling&para;<br>Act problem is a high one. The mere fact that a state law&para;<br>is designed as a procedural rule suggests it reflects a&para;<br>judgment about how state courts ought to operate and not&para;<br>a judgment about the scope of state-created rights and&para;<br>remedies. And for the purposes of operating a federal&para;<br>court system, there are costs involved in attempting to&para;<br>discover the true nature of a state procedural rule and&para;<br>allowing such a rule to operate alongside a federal rule&para;<br>that appears to govern the same question. The mere&para;<br>possibility that a federal rule would alter a state-created&para;<br>right is not sufficient. There must be little doubt.&para;<br>The text of CPLR §901(b) expressly and unambiguously&para;<br>applies not only to claims based on New York law but also&para;<br>to claims based on federal law or the law of any other&para;<br>State. And there is no interpretation from New York&para;<br>courts to the contrary. It is therefore hard to see how&para;<br>§901(b) could be understood as a rule that, though proce&para;<br>dural in form, serves the function of defining New York’s&para;<br>rights or remedies. This is all the more apparent because&para;<br>lawsuits under New York law could be joined in federal&para;<br>class actions well before New York passed §901(b) in 1975,&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P. A.&para;<br>v. ALLSTATE INS. CO.&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>and New York had done nothing to prevent that. It is&para;<br>true, as the dissent points out, that there is a limited&para;<br>amount of legislative history that can be read to suggest&para;<br>that the New York officials who supported §901(b) wished&para;<br>to create a “limitation” on New York’s “statutory dam&para;<br>ages.” Post, at 8. But, as JUSTICE SCALIA notes, that is&para;<br>not the law that New York adopted.16 See ante, at 7–8&para;<br>(opinion of the Court).&para;<br>The legislative history, moreover, does not clearly de&para;<br>scribe a judgment that §901(b) would operate as a limita&para;<br>tion on New York’s statutory damages. In evaluating that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>16 In its Erie analysis, the dissent observes that when sovereigns&para;<br>create laws, the enacting legislatures sometimes assume those laws&para;<br>will apply only within their territory. See post, at 18–20. That is a true&para;<br>fact, but it does not do very much work for the dissent’s position. For&para;<br>one thing, as the dissent observes, this Erie analysis is relevant only if&para;<br>there is no conflict between Rule 23 and §901(b), and the court can thus&para;<br>apply both. Post, at 17. But because, in my view, Rule 23 applies, the&para;<br>only question is whether it would violate the Enabling Act. See Hanna,&para;<br>380 U. S., at 471.&para;<br>And that inquiry is different from the Rules of&para;<br>Decision Act, or Erie, inquiry. See id., at 469–471.&para;<br>The dissent’s citations, moreover, highlight simply that when inter&para;<br>preting statutes, context matters. Thus, we sometimes presume that&para;<br>laws cover only domestic conduct and sometimes do not, depending&para;<br>upon, inter alia, whether it makes sense in a given situation to assume&para;<br>that “the character of an act as lawful or unlawful must be determined&para;<br>wholly by the law of the [place] where the act is done,” American&para;<br>Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U. S. 347, 356 (1909). But in the&para;<br>context of §901(b), a presumption against extraterritoriality makes&para;<br>little sense. That presumption applies almost only to laws governing&para;<br>what people can or cannot do. Section 901(b), however, is not directed&para;<br>to the conduct of persons but is instead directed to New York courts.&para;<br>Thus, §901(b) is, by its own terms, not extraterritorial insofar as it&para;<br>states that it governs New York courts. It is possible that the New&para;<br>York Legislature simply did not realize that New York courts hear&para;<br>claims under other sources of law and that other courts hear claims&para;<br>under New York law, and therefore mistakenly believed that they had&para;<br>written a limit on New York remedies. But because New York set up&para;<br>§901(b) as a general rule about how its courts operate, my strong&para;<br>presumption is to the contrary.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>legislative history, it is necessary to distinguish between&para;<br>procedural rules adopted for some policy reason and seem&para;<br>ingly procedural rules that are intimately bound up in the&para;<br>scope of a substantive right or remedy. Although almost&para;<br>every rule is adopted for some reason and has some effect&para;<br>on the outcome of litigation, not every state rule “defines&para;<br>the dimensions of [a] claim itself,” post, at 12. New York&para;<br>clearly crafted §901(b) with the intent that only certain&para;<br>lawsuits—those for which there were not statutory penal&para;<br>ties—could be joined in class actions in New York courts.&para;<br>That decision reflects a policy judgment about which&para;<br>lawsuits should proceed in New York courts in a class&para;<br>form and which should not. As JUSTICE GINSBURG care&para;<br>fully outlines, see post, at 8–10, §901(b) was “apparently”&para;<br>adopted in response to fears that the class-action proce&para;<br>dure, applied to statutory penalties, would lead to “ annihi&para;<br>lating punishment of the defendant.” V. Alexander, Prac&para;<br>tice Commentaries, C901:11, reprinted in 7B McKinney’s&para;<br>Consolidated Laws of New York Ann., p. 104 (2006) (in&para;<br>ternal quotation marks omitted); see also Sperry v.&para;<br>Crompton Corp., 8 N. Y. 3d 204, 211, 863 N. E. 2d 1012,&para;<br>1015 (2007). But statements such as these are not par&para;<br>ticularly strong evidence that §901(b) serves to define who&para;<br>can obtain a statutory penalty or that certifying such a&para;<br>class would enlarge New York’s remedy. Any device that&para;<br>makes litigation easier makes it easier for plaintiffs to&para;<br>recover damages.&para;<br>In addition to the fear of excessive recoveries, some&para;<br>opponents of a broad class-action device “argued that there&para;<br>was no need to permit class actions in order to encourage&para;<br>litigation . . . when statutory penalties . . . provided an&para;<br>aggrieved party with a sufficient economic incentive to&para;<br>pursue a claim.” Id., at 211, 863 N.

But those opponents may have felt merely&para;<br>that, for any number of reasons, New York courts should&para;<br>not conduct trials in the class format when that format is&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>SHADY GROVE ORTHOPEDIC ASSOCIATES, P.

But some people believe that&para;<br>class actions are inefficient or at least unfair, insofar as&para;<br>they join together slightly disparate claims or force courts&para;<br>to adjudicate unwieldy lawsuits. It is not for us to dismiss&para;<br>the possibility that New York legislators shared in those&para;<br>beliefs and thus wanted to exclude the class vehicle when&para;<br>it appeared to be unnecessary.&para;<br>The legislative history of §901 thus reveals a classically&para;<br>procedural calibration of making it easier to litigate claims&para;<br>in New York courts (under any source of law) only when it&para;<br>is necessary to do so, and not making it too easy when the&para;<br>class tool is not required. This is the same sort of calcula&para;<br>tion that might go into setting filing fees or deadlines for&para;<br>briefs. There is of course a difference of degree between&para;<br>those examples and class certification, but not a difference&para;<br>of kind; the class vehicle may have a greater practical&para;<br>effect on who brings lawsuits than do low filing fees, but&para;<br>that does not transform it into a damages “proscription,”&para;<br>post, at 12, n. 6, 21, or “limitation,” post, at 7, n. 2, 8, 9, 12,&para;<br>25.18&para;<br>——————&para;<br>17 To be sure, one could imagine the converse story, that a legislature&para;<br>would create statutory penalties but dictate that such penalties apply&para;<br>only when necessary to overcome the costs and inconvenience of filing a&para;<br>lawsuit, and thus are not necessary in a class action. But it is hard to&para;<br>see how that narrative applies to New York, given that New York’s&para;<br>penalty provisions, on their face, apply to all plaintiffs, be they class or&para;<br>individual, and that §901(b) addresses penalties that are created under&para;<br>any source of state or federal law.&para;<br>18 JUSTICE GINSBURG asserts that class certification in this matter&para;<br>would “transform a $500 case into a $5,000,000 award.” Post, at 1. But&para;<br>in fact, class certification would transform 10,000 $500 cases into one&para;<br>$5,000,000 case. It may be that without class certification, not all of&para;<br>the potential plaintiffs would bring their cases. But that is true of any&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

At the time of the litiga&para;<br>tion, Rule 23, now Rule 23.1, addressed a plaintiff’s insti&para;<br>tution of a derivative action in federal court. Although the&para;<br>Federal Rule specified prerequisites to a stockholder’s&para;<br>maintenance of a derivative action, the Court found no&para;<br>conflict between the Rule and the state statute in ques&para;<br>tion; the requirements of both could be enforced, the Court&para;<br>observed.

We held&para;<br>that Federal Rule 41(b), which provided that an involun&para;<br>tary dismissal “operate[d] as an adjudication on the mer&para;<br>its,” did not bar maintenance of the renewed action in&para;<br>Maryland. To hold that Rule 41(b) precluded the Mary&para;<br>land courts from entertaining the case, we said, “would&para;<br>arguably violate the jurisdictional limitation of the Rules&para;<br>Enabling Act,” 531 U.

The New York Legislature could have&para;<br>embedded the limitation in every provision creating a&para;<br>cause of action for which a penalty is authorized; §901(b)&para;<br>operates as shorthand to the same effect. It is as much a&para;<br>part of the delineation of the claim for relief as it would be&para;<br>were it included claim by claim in the New York Code.&para;<br>The Court single-mindedly focuses on whether a suit&para;<br>“may” or “may not” be maintained as a class action.

No. 109–14, p. 4 (2005) (CAFA prevents lawyers&para;<br>from “gam[ing] the procedural rules [to] keep nationwide&para;<br>or multi-state class actions in state courts whose judges&para;<br>have reputations for readily certifying classes.” (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted)); id., at 22 (disapproving “the ‘I&para;<br>never met a class action I didn’t like’ approach to class&para;<br>certification” that “is prevalent in state courts in some&para;<br>localities”). In other words, Congress envisioned fewer—&para;<br>not more—class actions overall. Congress surely never&para;<br>anticipated that CAFA would make federal courts a mecca&para;<br>for suits of the kind Shady Grove has launched: class&para;<br>actions seeking state-created penalties for claims arising&para;<br>under state law—claims that would be barred from class&para;<br>treatment in the State’s own courts.
