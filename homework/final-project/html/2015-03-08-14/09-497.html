JACKSON&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–497.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued April 26, 2010—Decided June 21, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent Jackson filed an employment-discrimination suit against&para;<br>petitioner Rent-A-Center, his former employer, in a Nevada Federal&para;<br>District Court. Rent-A-Center filed a motion, under the Federal Ar&para;<br>bitration Act (FAA), to dismiss or stay the proceedings, 9 U. S. C. §3,&para;<br>and to compel arbitration, §4, based on the arbitration agreement&para;<br>(Agreement) Jackson signed as a condition of his employment. Jack&para;<br>son opposed the motion on the ground that the Agreement was unen&para;<br>forceable in that it was unconscionable under Nevada law. The Dis&para;<br>trict Court granted Rent-A-Center’s motion. The Ninth Circuit&para;<br>reversed in relevant part.&para;<br>Held: Under the FAA, where an agreement to arbitrate includes an&para;<br>agreement that the arbitrator will determine the enforceability of the&para;<br>agreement, if a party challenges specifically the enforceability of that&para;<br>particular agreement, the district court considers the challenge, but if&para;<br>a party challenges the enforceability of the agreement as a whole, the&para;<br>challenge is for the arbitrator. Pp. 3–12.&para;<br>(a) Section 2 of the FAA places arbitration agreements on an equal&para;<br>footing with other contracts, Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v.&para;<br>Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 443, and requires courts to enforce them ac&para;<br>cording to their terms, Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of&para;<br>Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 478, “save&para;<br>upon such grounds as exist under law or in equity for the revocation&para;<br>of any contract,” §2. Here, the Agreement included two relevant arbi&para;<br>tration provisions: it provided for arbitration of all disputes arising&para;<br>out of Jackson’s employment, including discrimination claims, and it&para;<br>gave the “Arbitrator . . . exclusive authority to resolve any dispute re&para;<br>lating to the [Agreement’s] enforceability . . . including . . . any claim&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.” Rent-ACenter seeks enforcement of the second provision, which delegates to&para;<br>the arbitrator the “gateway” question of enforceability. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 83–85. The&para;<br>court must enforce the delegation provision under §§3 and 4 unless it&para;<br>is unenforceable under §2. Pp. 3–6.&para;<br>(b) There are two types of validity challenges under §2: one “chal&para;<br>lenges specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate,” and&para;<br>“[t]he other challenges the contract as a whole,” Buckeye, supra, at&para;<br>444. Only the first is relevant to a court’s determination of an arbi&para;<br>tration agreement’s enforceability, see, e.g., Prima Paint Corp. v.&para;<br>Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403–404, because under §2&para;<br>“an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the con&para;<br>tract,” Buckeye, supra, at 445. That does not mean that agreements&para;<br>to arbitrate are unassailable. If a party challenges the validity under&para;<br>§2 of the precise agreement to arbitrate at issue, the federal court&para;<br>must consider the challenge before ordering compliance with the&para;<br>agreement under §4. That is no less true when the precise agree&para;<br>ment to arbitrate is itself part of a larger arbitration agreement. Be&para;<br>cause here the agreement to arbitrate enforceability (the delegation&para;<br>provision) is severable from the remainder of the Agreement, unless&para;<br>Jackson challenged the delegation provision specifically, it must be&para;<br>treated as valid under §2 and enforced under §§3 and 4. Pp. 6–9.&para;<br>(c) The District Court correctly concluded that Jackson challenged&para;<br>only the validity of the contract as a whole. In his brief to this Court&para;<br>he raised a challenge to the delegation provision for the first time,&para;<br>but that is too late and will not be considered. See 14 Penn Plaza&para;<br>LLC v.

S. C. §§1–16, a district court may decide&para;<br>a claim that an arbitration agreement is unconscionable,&para;<br>where the agreement explicitly assigns that decision to the&para;<br>arbitrator.&para;<br>I&para;<br>On February 1, 2007, the respondent here, Antonio&para;<br>Jackson, filed an employment-discrimination suit under&para;<br>Rev. Stat. §1977, 42 U. S. C. §1981, against his former&para;<br>employer in the United States District Court for the Dis&para;<br>trict of Nevada. The defendant and petitioner here, RentA-Center, West, Inc., filed a motion under the FAA to&para;<br>dismiss or stay the proceedings, 9 U. S. C. §3, and to com&para;<br>pel arbitration, §4. Rent-A-Center argued that the Mutual&para;<br>Agreement to Arbitrate Claims (Agreement), which Jack&para;<br>son signed on February 24, 2003 as a condition of his&para;<br>employment there, precluded Jackson from pursuing his&para;<br>claims in court. The Agreement provided for arbitration of&para;<br>all “past, present or future” disputes arising out of Jack&para;<br>son’s employment with Rent-A-Center, including “claims&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>for discrimination” and “claims for violation of any federal&para;<br>. . . law.” App. 29–30. It also provided that “[t]he Arbitra&para;<br>tor, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency,&para;<br>shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute&para;<br>relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability&para;<br>or formation of this Agreement including, but not limited&para;<br>to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void&para;<br>or voidable.” Id., at 34.&para;<br>Jackson opposed the motion on the ground that “the&para;<br>arbitration agreement in question is clearly unenforceable&para;<br>in that it is unconscionable” under Nevada law. Id., at 40.&para;<br>Rent-A-Center responded that Jackson’s unconscionability&para;<br>claim was not properly before the court because Jackson&para;<br>had expressly agreed that the arbitrator would have ex&para;<br>clusive authority to resolve any dispute about the enforce&para;<br>ability of the Agreement. It also disputed the merits of&para;<br>Jackson’s unconscionability claims.&para;<br>The District Court granted Rent-A-Center’s motion to&para;<br>dismiss the proceedings and to compel arbitration. The&para;<br>court found that the Agreement “ ‘ “clearly and unmistak&para;<br>enly [sic]” ’ ” gives the arbitrator exclusive authority to&para;<br>decide whether the Agreement is enforceable, App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 4a. (quoting Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds,&para;<br>Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 83 (2002)), and, because Jackson chal&para;<br>lenged the validity of the Agreement as a whole, the issue&para;<br>was for the arbitrator, App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a (citing&para;<br>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440,&para;<br>444–445 (2006)). The court noted that even if it were to&para;<br>examine the merits of Jackson’s unconscionability claims,&para;<br>it would have rejected the claim that the agreement to&para;<br>split arbitration fees was substantively unconscionable&para;<br>under Nevada law. It did not address Jackson’s proce&para;<br>dural or other substantive unconscionability arguments.&para;<br>Without oral argument, a divided panel of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in part, affirmed in&para;<br>part, and remanded. 581 F. 3d 912 (2009). The court&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>reversed on the question of who (the court or arbitrator)&para;<br>had the authority to decide whether the Agreement is&para;<br>enforceable. It noted that “Jackson does not dispute that&para;<br>the language of the Agreement clearly assigns the arbitra&para;<br>bility determination to the arbitrator,” but held that where&para;<br>“a party challenges an arbitration agreement as uncon&para;<br>scionable, and thus asserts that he could not meaningfully&para;<br>assent to the agreement, the threshold question of uncon&para;<br>scionability is for the court.” Id., at 917. The Ninth Cir&para;<br>cuit affirmed the District Court’s alternative conclusion&para;<br>that the fee-sharing provision was not substantively un&para;<br>conscionable and remanded for consideration of Jackson’s&para;<br>other unconscionability arguments. Id., at 919–920, and&para;<br>n. 3. Judge Hall dissented on the ground that “the ques&para;<br>tion of the arbitration agreement’s validity should have&para;<br>gone to the arbitrator, as the parties ‘clearly and unmis&para;<br>takably provide[d]’ in their agreement.” Id., at 921.&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 558 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The FAA reflects the fundamental principle that arbi&para;<br>tration is a matter of contract. Section 2, the “primary&para;<br>substantive provision of the Act,” Moses H. Cone Memorial&para;<br>Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24 (1983),&para;<br>provides:&para;<br>“A written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a&para;<br>transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitra&para;<br>tion a controversy thereafter arising out of such con&para;<br>tract . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,&para;<br>save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for&para;<br>the revocation of any contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2.&para;<br>The FAA thereby places arbitration agreements on an&para;<br>equal footing with other contracts, Buckeye, supra, at 443,&para;<br>and requires courts to enforce them according to their&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>terms, Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees&para;<br>of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 478&para;<br>(1989). Like other contracts, however, they may be invali&para;<br>dated by “generally applicable contract defenses, such as&para;<br>fraud, duress, or unconscionability.” Doctor’s Associates,&para;<br>Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687 (1996).&para;<br>The Act also establishes procedures by which federal&para;<br>courts implement §2’s substantive rule. Under §3, a party&para;<br>may apply to a federal court for a stay of the trial of an&para;<br>action “upon any issue referable to arbitration under an&para;<br>agreement in writing for such arbitration.” Under §4, a&para;<br>party “aggrieved” by the failure of another party “to arbi&para;<br>trate under a written agreement for arbitration” may&para;<br>petition a federal court “for an order directing that such&para;<br>arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such&para;<br>agreement.” The court “shall” order arbitration “upon&para;<br>being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbi&para;<br>tration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>The Agreement here contains multiple “written provi&para;<br>sion[s]” to “settle by arbitration a controversy,” §2. Two&para;<br>are relevant to our discussion. First, the section titled&para;<br>“Claims Covered By The Agreement” provides for arbitra&para;<br>tion of all “past, present or future” disputes arising out of&para;<br>Jackson’s employment with Rent-A-Center. App. 29.&para;<br>Second, the section titled “Arbitration Procedures” pro&para;<br>vides that “[t]he Arbitrator . . . shall have exclusive au&para;<br>thority to resolve any dispute relating to the . . . enforce&para;<br>ability . . . of this Agreement including, but not limited to&para;<br>any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or&para;<br>voidable.” Id., at 32, 34. The current “controversy” be&para;<br>tween the parties is whether the Agreement is uncon&para;<br>scionable. It is the second provision, which delegates&para;<br>resolution of that controversy to the arbitrator, that RentA-Center seeks to enforce. Adopting the terminology used&para;<br>by the parties, we will refer to it as the delegation provi&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sion.&para;<br>The delegation provision is an agreement to arbitrate&para;<br>threshold issues concerning the arbitration agreement.&para;<br>We have recognized that parties can agree to arbitrate&para;<br>“gateway” questions of “arbitrability,” such as whether the&para;<br>parties have agreed to arbitrate or whether their agree&para;<br>ment covers a particular controversy. See, e.g., Howsam,&para;<br>537 U. S., at 83–85; Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle,&para;<br>539 U. S. 444, 452 (2003) (plurality opinion). This line of&para;<br>cases merely reflects the principle that arbitration is a&para;<br>matter of contract.1 See First Options of Chicago, Inc. v.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 There is one caveat. First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514&para;<br>U. S. 938, 944 (1995), held that “[c]ourts should not assume that the&para;<br>parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is ‘clea[r] and&para;<br>unmistakabl[e]’ evidence that they did so.” The parties agree the&para;<br>heightened standard applies here. See Brief for Petitioner 21; Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 54. The District Court concluded the “Agreement to&para;<br>Arbitrate clearly and unmistakenly [sic] provides the arbitrator with&para;<br>the exclusive authority to decide whether the Agreement to Arbitrate is&para;<br>enforceable.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a. The Ninth Circuit noted that&para;<br>Jackson did not dispute that the text of the Agreement was clear and&para;<br>unmistakable on this point. 581 F. 3d 912, 917 (2009). He also does&para;<br>not dispute it here. What he argues now, however, is that it is not&para;<br>“clear and unmistakable” that his agreement to that text was valid,&para;<br>because of the unconscionability claims he raises. See Brief for Re&para;<br>spondent 54–55. The dissent makes the same argument. See post, at&para;<br>5–8 (opinion of STEVENS, J.).&para;<br>This mistakes the subject of the First Options “clear and unmistak&para;<br>able” requirement. It pertains to the parties’ manifestation of intent,&para;<br>not the agreement’s validity. As explained in Howsam v. Dean Witter&para;<br>Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 83 (2002), it is an “interpretive rule,” based&para;<br>on an assumption about the parties’ expectations. In “circumstance[s]&para;<br>where contracting parties would likely have expected a court to have&para;<br>decided the gateway matter,” ibid., we assume that is what they agreed&para;<br>to. Thus, “[u]nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide&para;<br>otherwise, the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to&para;<br>be decided by the court, not the arbitrator.” AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. v.&para;<br>Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986).&para;<br>The validity of a written agreement to arbitrate (whether it is legally&para;<br>binding, as opposed to whether it was in fact agreed to—including, of&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 943 (1995). An agreement to arbi&para;<br>trate a gateway issue is simply an additional, antecedent&para;<br>agreement the party seeking arbitration asks the federal&para;<br>court to enforce, and the FAA operates on this additional&para;<br>arbitration agreement just as it does on any other. The&para;<br>additional agreement is valid under §2 “save upon such&para;<br>grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of&para;<br>any contract,” and federal courts can enforce the agree&para;<br>ment by staying federal litigation under §3 and compelling&para;<br>arbitration under §4. The question before us, then, is&para;<br>whether the delegation provision is valid under §2.&para;<br>B&para;<br>There are two types of validity challenges under §2:&para;<br>“One type challenges specifically the validity of the&para;<br>agreement to arbitrate,” and “[t]he other challenges the&para;<br>contract as a whole, either on a ground that directly af&para;<br>fects the entire agreement (e.g., the agreement was&para;<br>fraudulently induced), or on the ground that the illegality&para;<br>of one of the contract’s provisions renders the whole con&para;<br>tract invalid.” Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 444. In a line of&para;<br>cases neither party has asked us to overrule, we held that&para;<br>only the first type of challenge is relevant to a court’s&para;<br>determination whether the arbitration agreement at issue&para;<br>is enforceable.2 See Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin&para;<br>Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403–404 (1967); Buckeye, supra, at&para;<br>——————&para;<br>course, whether it was void for unconscionability) is governed by §2’s&para;<br>provision that it shall be valid “save upon such grounds as exist at law&para;<br>or equity for the revocation of any contract.” Those grounds do not&para;<br>include, of course, any requirement that its lack of unconscionability&para;<br>must be “clear and unmistakable.” And they are not grounds that First&para;<br>Options added for agreements to arbitrate gateway issues; §2 applies to&para;<br>all written agreements to arbitrate.&para;<br>2 The issue of the agreement’s “validity” is different from the issue&para;<br>whether any agreement between the parties “was ever concluded,” and,&para;<br>as in Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440 (2006),&para;<br>we address only the former. Id., at 444, n. 1.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>444–446; Preston v. Ferrer, 552 U. S. 346, 353–354 (2008).&para;<br>That is because §2 states that a “written provision” “to&para;<br>settle by arbitration a controversy” is “valid, irrevocable,&para;<br>and enforceable” without mention of the validity of the&para;<br>contract in which it is contained. Thus, a party’s chal&para;<br>lenge to another provision of the contract, or to the con&para;<br>tract as a whole, does not prevent a court from enforcing a&para;<br>specific agreement to arbitrate. “[A]s a matter of substan&para;<br>tive federal arbitration law, an arbitration provision is&para;<br>severable from the remainder of the contract.” Buckeye,&para;<br>546 U. S., at 445; see also id., at 447 (the severability rule&para;<br>is based on §2).&para;<br>But that agreements to arbitrate are severable does not&para;<br>mean that they are unassailable. If a party challenges the&para;<br>validity under §2 of the precise agreement to arbitrate at&para;<br>issue, the federal court must consider the challenge before&para;<br>ordering compliance with that agreement under §4. In&para;<br>Prima Paint, for example, if the claim had been “fraud in&para;<br>the inducement of the arbitration clause itself,” then the&para;<br>court would have considered it. 388 U. S., at 403–404.&para;<br>“To immunize an arbitration agreement from judicial&para;<br>challenge on the ground of fraud in the inducement would&para;<br>be to elevate it over other forms of contract,” id., at 404,&para;<br>n. 12. In some cases the claimed basis of invalidity for the&para;<br>contract as a whole will be much easier to establish than&para;<br>the same basis as applied only to the severable agreement&para;<br>to arbitrate. Thus, in an employment contract many&para;<br>elements of alleged unconscionability applicable to the&para;<br>entire contract (outrageously low wages, for example)&para;<br>would not affect the agreement to arbitrate alone. But&para;<br>even where that is not the case—as in Prima Paint itself,&para;<br>where the alleged fraud that induced the whole contract&para;<br>equally induced the agreement to arbitrate which was part&para;<br>of that contract—we nonetheless require the basis of&para;<br>challenge to be directed specifically to the agreement to&para;<br>arbitrate before the court will intervene.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Here, the “written provision . . . to settle by arbitration a&para;<br>controversy,” 9 U. S. C. §2, that Rent-A-Center asks us to&para;<br>enforce is the delegation provision—the provision that&para;<br>gave the arbitrator “exclusive authority to resolve any&para;<br>dispute relating to the . . . enforceability . . . of this&para;<br>Agreement,” App. 34. The “remainder of the contract,”&para;<br>Buckeye, supra, at 445, is the rest of the agreement to&para;<br>arbitrate claims arising out of Jackson’s employment with&para;<br>Rent-A-Center. To be sure this case differs from Prima&para;<br>Paint, Buckeye, and Preston, in that the arbitration provi&para;<br>sions sought to be enforced in those cases were contained&para;<br>in contracts unrelated to arbitration—contracts for con&para;<br>sulting services, see Prima Paint, supra, at 397, check&para;<br>cashing services, see Buckeye, supra, at 442, and “personal&para;<br>management” or “talent agent” services, see Preston,&para;<br>supra, at 352. In this case, the underlying contract is&para;<br>itself an arbitration agreement. But that makes no differ&para;<br>ence.3 Application of the severability rule does not depend&para;<br>on the substance of the remainder of the contract. Section&para;<br>2 operates on the specific “written provision” to “settle by&para;<br>arbitration a controversy” that the party seeks to enforce.&para;<br>Accordingly, unless Jackson challenged the delegation&para;<br>provision specifically, we must treat it as valid under §2,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent calls this a “breezy assertion,” post, at 1, but it seems to&para;<br>us self-evident. When the dissent comes to discussing the point, post,&para;<br>at 11, it gives no logical reason why an agreement to arbitrate one&para;<br>controversy (an employment-discrimination claim) is not severable from&para;<br>an agreement to arbitrate a different controversy (enforceability).&para;<br>There is none. Since the dissent accepts that the invalidity of one&para;<br>provision within an arbitration agreement does not necessarily invali&para;<br>date its other provisions, post, at 7, n. 7, it cannot believe in some sort&para;<br>of magic bond between arbitration provisions that prevents them from&para;<br>being severed from each other. According to the dissent, it is fine to&para;<br>sever an invalid provision within an arbitration agreement when&para;<br>severability is a matter of state law, but severability is not allowed&para;<br>when it comes to applying Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg.&para;<br>Co., 388 U. S. 395 (1967).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and must enforce it under §§3 and 4, leaving any chal&para;<br>lenge to the validity of the Agreement as a whole for the&para;<br>arbitrator.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The District Court correctly concluded that Jackson&para;<br>challenged only the validity of the contract as a whole.&para;<br>Nowhere in his opposition to Rent-A-Center’s motion to&para;<br>compel arbitration did he even mention the delegation&para;<br>provision. See App. 39–47. Rent-A-Center noted this fact&para;<br>in its reply: “[Jackson’s response] fails to rebut or other&para;<br>wise address in any way [Rent-A-Center’s] argument that&para;<br>the Arbitrator must decide [Jackson’s] challenge to&para;<br>the enforceability of the Agreement. Thus, [Rent-ACenter’s] argument is uncontested.” Id., at 50 (emphasis in&para;<br>original).&para;<br>The arguments Jackson made in his response to Rent-ACenter’s motion to compel arbitration support this conclu&para;<br>sion. Jackson stated that “the entire agreement seems&para;<br>drawn to provide [Rent-A-Center] with undue advantages&para;<br>should an employment-related dispute arise.” Id., at 44&para;<br>(emphasis added). At one point, he argued that the limita&para;<br>tions on discovery “further suppor[t] [his] contention that&para;<br>the arbitration agreement as a whole is substantively&para;<br>unconscionable.” Ibid. (emphasis added). And before this&para;<br>Court, Jackson describes his challenge in the District&para;<br>Court as follows: He “opposed the motion to compel on the&para;<br>ground that the entire arbitration agreement, including the&para;<br>delegation clause, was unconscionable.” Brief for Respon&para;<br>dent 55 (emphasis added). That is an accurate description&para;<br>of his filings.&para;<br>As required to make out a claim of unconscionability&para;<br>under Nevada law, see 581 F. 3d, at 919, he contended&para;<br>that the Agreement was both procedurally and substan&para;<br>tively unconscionable. It was procedurally unconscion&para;<br>able, he argued, because it “was imposed as a condition of&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>employment and was non-negotiable.” App. 41. But we&para;<br>need not consider that claim because none of Jackson’s&para;<br>substantive unconscionability challenges was specific to&para;<br>the delegation provision. First, he argued that the Agree&para;<br>ment’s coverage was one sided in that it required arbitra&para;<br>tion of claims an employee was likely to bring—contract,&para;<br>tort, discrimination, and statutory claims—but did not&para;<br>require arbitration of claims Rent-A-Center was likely to&para;<br>bring—intellectual property, unfair competition, and trade&para;<br>secrets claims. Id., at 42–43. This one-sided-coverage&para;<br>argument clearly did not go to the validity of the delega&para;<br>tion provision.&para;<br>Jackson’s other two substantive unconscionability ar&para;<br>guments assailed arbitration procedures called for by the&para;<br>contract—the fee-splitting arrangement and the limita&para;<br>tions on discovery—procedures that were to be used dur&para;<br>ing arbitration under both the agreement to arbitrate&para;<br>employment-related disputes and the delegation provision.&para;<br>It may be that had Jackson challenged the delegation&para;<br>provision by arguing that these common procedures as&para;<br>applied to the delegation provision rendered that provision&para;<br>unconscionable, the challenge should have been consid&para;<br>ered by the court. To make such a claim based on the&para;<br>discovery procedures, Jackson would have had to argue&para;<br>that the limitation upon the number of depositions causes&para;<br>the arbitration of his claim that the Agreement is unen&para;<br>forceable to be unconscionable. That would be, of course, a&para;<br>much more difficult argument to sustain than the argu&para;<br>ment that the same limitation renders arbitration of his&para;<br>factbound employment-discrimination claim unconscion&para;<br>able. Likewise, the unfairness of the fee-splitting ar&para;<br>rangement may be more difficult to establish for the arbi&para;<br>tration of enforceability than for arbitration of more&para;<br>complex and fact-related aspects of the alleged employ&para;<br>ment discrimination. Jackson, however, did not make any&para;<br>arguments specific to the delegation provision; he argued&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that the fee-sharing and discovery procedures rendered&para;<br>the entire Agreement invalid.&para;<br>Jackson’s appeal to the Ninth Circuit confirms that he&para;<br>did not contest the validity of the delegation provision in&para;<br>particular. His brief noted the existence of the delegation&para;<br>provision, Brief for Appellant in No. 07–16164, p. 3, but&para;<br>his unconscionability arguments made no mention of it,&para;<br>id., at 3–7. He also repeated the arguments he had made&para;<br>before the District Court, see supra, at 9, that the “entire&para;<br>agreement” favors Rent-A-Center and that the limitations&para;<br>on discovery further his “contention that the arbitration&para;<br>agreement as a whole is substantively unconscionable,”&para;<br>Brief for Appellant 7–8. Finally, he repeated the argu&para;<br>ment made in his District Court filings, that under state&para;<br>law the unconscionable clauses could not be severed from&para;<br>the arbitration agreement, see id., at 8–9.4 The point of&para;<br>this argument, of course, is that the Agreement as a whole&para;<br>is unconscionable under state law.&para;<br>Jackson repeated that argument before this Court. At&para;<br>oral argument, counsel stated: “There are certain elements&para;<br>of the arbitration agreement that are unconscionable and,&para;<br>under Nevada law, which would render the entire arbitra&para;<br>tion agreement unconscionable.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 43 (em&para;<br>phasis added). And again, he stated, “we’ve got both&para;<br>certain provisions that are unconscionable, that under&para;<br>Nevada law render the entire agreement unconscionable&para;<br>. . . , and that’s what the Court is to rely on.” Id., at 43–44&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Jackson’s argument fails. The severability rule is a “matter of sub&para;<br>stantive federal arbitration law,” and we have repeatedly “rejected the&para;<br>view that the question of ‘severability’ was one of state law, so that if&para;<br>state law held the arbitration provision not to be severable a challenge&para;<br>to the contract as a whole would be decided by the court.” Buckeye, 546&para;<br>U.

Its breezy assertion that&para;<br>the subject matter of the contract at issue—in this case, an&para;<br>arbitration agreement and nothing more—“makes no&para;<br>difference,” ante, at 7, is simply wrong. This written&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>arbitration agreement is but one part of a broader em&para;<br>ployment agreement between the parties, just as the&para;<br>arbitration clause in Prima Paint was but one part of a&para;<br>broader contract for services between those parties. Thus,&para;<br>that the subject matter of the agreement is exclusively&para;<br>arbitration makes all the difference in the Prima Paint&para;<br>analysis.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§1–16, parties generally have substantial leeway to&para;<br>define the terms and scope of their agreement to settle&para;<br>disputes in an arbitral forum. “[A]rbitration is,” after all,&para;<br>“simply a matter of contract between the parties; it is a&para;<br>way to resolve those disputes—but only those disputes—&para;<br>that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.”&para;<br>First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938,&para;<br>943 (1995). The FAA, therefore, envisions a limited role&para;<br>for courts asked to stay litigation and refer disputes to&para;<br>arbitration.&para;<br>Certain issues—the kind that “contracting parties would&para;<br>likely have expected a court to have decided”—remain&para;<br>within the province of judicial review.

Howsam, 537 U. S., at 83. Quintessential&para;<br>gateway matters include “whether the parties have a valid&para;<br>arbitration agreement at all,” Bazzle, 539 U.

In&para;<br>this case we are concerned with the first of these catego&para;<br>ries: whether the parties have a valid arbitration agree&para;<br>ment. This is an issue the FAA assigns to the courts.2&para;<br>Section 2 of the FAA dictates that covered arbitration&para;<br>agreements “shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,&para;<br>save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the&para;<br>revocation of any contract.” 9 U.

Casarotto, 517 U.

When&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Although it is not clear from our precedents, I understand “gateway&para;<br>matters” and “questions of arbitrability” to be roughly synonymous, if&para;<br>not exactly so. At the very least, the former includes all of the latter.&para;<br>2 Gateway issues involving the scope of an otherwise valid arbitration&para;<br>agreement also have a statutory origin. Section 3 of the FAA provides&para;<br>that “upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit . . . is&para;<br>referable to arbitration under such an agreement,” a court “shall . . .&para;<br>stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had.” 9&para;<br>U. S. C. §3.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the parties have purportedly done so, courts must examine&para;<br>two distinct rules to decide whether the delegation is&para;<br>valid.&para;<br>The first line of cases looks to the parties’ intent. In&para;<br>AT&amp;T Technologies, we stated that “question[s] of arbi&para;<br>trability” may be delegated to the arbitrator, so long as the&para;<br>delegation is clear and unmistakable. 475 U. S., at 649.&para;<br>We reaffirmed this rule, and added some nuance, in First&para;<br>Options. Against the background presumption that ques&para;<br>tions of arbitrability go to the court, we stated that federal&para;<br>courts should “generally” apply “ordinary state-law princi&para;<br>ples that govern the formation of contracts” to assess&para;<br>“whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter&para;<br>(including arbitrability).” 514 U. S., at 944. But, we&para;<br>added, a more rigorous standard applies when the inquiry&para;<br>is whether the parties have “agreed to arbitrate arbitrabil&para;<br>ity”: “Courts should not assume that the parties agreed to&para;<br>arbitrate arbitrability unless there is clear and unmistak&para;<br>able evidence that they did so.”3 Ibid. (internal quotation&para;<br>marks and brackets omitted). JUSTICE BREYER’s unani&para;<br>mous opinion for the Court described this standard as a&para;<br>type of “revers[e]” “presumption”4—one in favor of a judi&para;<br>cial, rather than an arbitral, forum. Id., at 945. Clear and&para;<br>unmistakable “evidence” of agreement to arbitrate arbi&para;<br>trability might include, as was urged in First Options, a&para;<br>course of conduct demonstrating assent,5 id., at 946, or, as&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 We&para;<br>&para;<br>have not expressly decided whether the First Options delegation&para;<br>principle would apply to questions of arbitrability that implicate §2&para;<br>concerns, i.e., grounds for contract revocation. I do not need to weigh in&para;<br>on this issue in order to resolve the present case.&para;<br>4 It is a “revers[e]” presumption because it is counter to the presump&para;<br>tion we usually apply in favor of arbitration when the question con&para;<br>cerns whether a particular dispute falls within the scope of a conced&para;<br>edly binding arbitration agreement. First Options, 514 U. S., at 944–&para;<br>945.&para;<br>5 In First Options we found no clear and unmistakable assent to dele&para;<br>gate to the arbitrator questions of arbitrability, given the parties’&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>is urged in this case, an express agreement to do so. In&para;<br>any event, whether such evidence exists is a matter for the&para;<br>court to determine.&para;<br>The second line of cases bearing on who decides the&para;<br>validity of an arbitration agreement, as the Court ex&para;<br>plains, involves the Prima Paint rule. See ante, at 6. That&para;<br>rule recognizes two types of validity challenges. One type&para;<br>challenges the validity of the arbitration agreement itself,&para;<br>on a ground arising from an infirmity in that agreement.&para;<br>The other challenges the validity of the arbitration agree&para;<br>ment tangentially—via a claim that the entire contract (of&para;<br>which the arbitration agreement is but a part) is invalid&para;<br>for some reason. See Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 444. Under&para;<br>Prima Paint, a challenge of the first type goes to the court;&para;<br>a challenge of the second type goes to the arbitrator. See&para;<br>388 U. S., at 403–404; see also Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 444–&para;<br>445. The Prima Paint rule is akin to a pleading standard,&para;<br>whereby a party seeking to challenge the validity of an&para;<br>arbitration agreement must expressly say so in order to&para;<br>get his dispute into court.&para;<br>In sum, questions related to the validity of an arbitra&para;<br>tion agreement are usually matters for a court to resolve&para;<br>before it refers a dispute to arbitration. But questions of&para;<br>arbitrability may go to the arbitrator in two instances: (1)&para;<br>when the parties have demonstrated, clearly and unmis&para;<br>takably, that it is their intent to do so; or (2) when the&para;<br>validity of an arbitration agreement depends exclusively&para;<br>on the validity of the substantive contract of which it is a&para;<br>part.&para;<br>II&para;<br>We might have resolved this case by simply applying the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>conduct. Respondents in that case had participated in the arbitration,&para;<br>but only to object to proceeding in arbitration and to challenge the&para;<br>arbitrators’ jurisdiction. That kind of participation—in protest, to&para;<br>preserve legal claims—did not constitute unmistakable assent to be&para;<br>bound by the result. Id., at 946–947.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>First Options rule: Does the arbitration agreement at&para;<br>issue “clearly and unmistakably” evince petitioner’s and&para;<br>respondent’s intent to submit questions of arbitrability to&para;<br>the arbitrator?6 The answer to that question is no. Re&para;<br>spondent’s claim that the arbitration agreement is uncon&para;<br>scionable undermines any suggestion that he “clearly” and&para;<br>“unmistakably” assented to submit questions of arbitrabil&para;<br>ity to the arbitrator. See Restatement (Second) of Con&para;<br>tracts §208, Comment d (1979) (“[G]ross inequality of&para;<br>bargaining power, together with terms unreasonably&para;<br>favorable to the stronger party, may confirm indications&para;<br>that the transaction involved elements of deception or&para;<br>compulsion, or may show that the weaker party had no&para;<br>meaningful choice, no real alternative, or did not in fact&para;<br>assent or appear to assent to the unfair terms”); American&para;<br>Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U. S. 219, 249 (1995)&para;<br>(O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in&para;<br>part) (“[A] determination that a contract is ‘unconscion&para;<br>able’ may in fact be a determination that one party did not&para;<br>intend to agree to the terms of the contract”).7 The fact&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Respondent&para;<br>&para;<br>has challenged whether he “meaningfully agreed to the&para;<br>terms of the form Agreement to Arbitrate, which he contends is proce&para;<br>durally and substantively unconscionable.” 581 F. 3d 912, 917 (CA9&para;<br>2009). Even if First Options relates only to “manifestations of intent,”&para;<br>as the Court states, see ante, at 5–6, n. 1 (emphasis deleted), whether&para;<br>there has been meaningful agreement surely bears some relation to&para;<br>whether one party has manifested intent to be bound to an agreement.&para;<br>7 The question of unconscionability in this case is one of state law.&para;<br>See, e.g., Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 492, n. 9 (1987). Under&para;<br>Nevada law, unconscionability requires a showing of “ ‘both procedural&para;<br>and substantive unconscionability,’ ” but “less evidence of substantive&para;<br>unconscionability is required in cases involving great procedural&para;<br>unconscionability.” D. R. Horton, Inc. v. Green, 120 Nev. 549, 553–554,&para;<br>96 P. 3d 1159, 1162 (2004). I understand respondent to have claimed,&para;<br>in accord with Nevada law, that the arbitration agreement contained&para;<br>substantively unconscionable provisions, and was also the product of&para;<br>procedural unconscionability as a whole. See Brief for Respondent 3&para;<br>(“[Respondent] argued that the clause is procedurally unconscionable&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that the agreement’s “delegation” provision suggests&para;<br>assent is beside the point, because the gravamen of re&para;<br>spondent’s claim is that he never consented to the terms in&para;<br>his agreement.&para;<br>In other words, when a party raises a good-faith validity&para;<br>challenge to the arbitration agreement itself, that issue&para;<br>must be resolved before a court can say that he clearly and&para;<br>unmistakably intended to arbitrate that very validity&para;<br>question. This case well illustrates the point: If respon&para;<br>dent’s unconscionability claim is correct—i.e., if the terms&para;<br>of the agreement are so one-sided and the process of its&para;<br>making so unfair—it would contravene the existence of&para;<br>clear and unmistakable assent to arbitrate the very ques&para;<br>tion petitioner now seeks to arbitrate. Accordingly, it is&para;<br>necessary for the court to resolve the merits of respon&para;<br>dent’s unconscionability claim in order to decide whether&para;<br>the parties have a valid arbitration agreement under §2.&para;<br>Otherwise, that section’s preservation of revocation issues&para;<br>for the Court would be meaningless.&para;<br>This is, in essence, how I understand the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals to have decided the issue below. See 581 F. 3d 912,&para;<br>917 (CA9 2009) (“[W]e hold that where, as here, a party&para;<br>challenges an arbitration agreement as unconscionable,&para;<br>and thus asserts that he could not meaningfully assent to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>because he was in a position of unequal bargaining power when it was&para;<br>imposed as a condition of employment”); id., at 3–4 (identifying three&para;<br>distinct provisions of the agreement that were substantively uncon&para;<br>scionable); accord, 581 F. 3d, at 917.&para;<br>Some of respondent’s arguments, however, could be understood as&para;<br>attacks not on the enforceability of the agreement as a whole but&para;<br>merely on the fairness of individual contract terms. Such term-specific&para;<br>challenges would generally be for the arbitrator to resolve (at least so&para;<br>long as they do not go to the identity of the arbitrator or the ability of a&para;<br>party to initiate arbitration). Cf. Restatement (Second) of Contracts&para;<br>§208 (1979) (providing that “a contract or term thereof [may be] uncon&para;<br>scionable” and that in the latter case “the remainder of the contract&para;<br>without the unconscionable term” may be enforced).&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the agreement, the threshold question of unconscionability&para;<br>is for the court”). I would therefore affirm its judgment,&para;<br>leaving, as it did, the merits of respondent’s unconscion&para;<br>ability claim for the District Court to resolve on remand.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Rather than apply First Options, the Court takes us&para;<br>down a different path, one neither briefed by the parties&para;<br>nor relied upon by the Court of Appeals. In applying&para;<br>Prima Paint, the Court has unwisely extended a “fantas&para;<br>tic” and likely erroneous decision. 388 U. S., at 407&para;<br>(Black, J., dissenting).8&para;<br>As explained at the outset, see supra, at 3–7, this case&para;<br>lies at a seeming crossroads in our arbitration jurispru&para;<br>dence. It implicates cases such as First Options, which&para;<br>address whether the parties intended to delegate ques&para;<br>tions of arbitrability, and also those cases, such as Prima&para;<br>Paint, which address the severability of a presumptively&para;<br>valid arbitration agreement from a potentially invalid&para;<br>contract. The question of “Who decides?”—arbitrator or&para;<br>court—animates both lines of cases, but they are driven by&para;<br>different concerns. In cases like First Options, we are&para;<br>concerned with the parties’ intentions. In cases like Prima&para;<br>Paint, we are concerned with how the parties challenge&para;<br>the validity of the agreement.&para;<br>Under the Prima Paint inquiry, recall, we consider&para;<br>whether the parties are actually challenging the validity&para;<br>of the arbitration agreement, or whether they are chal&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Justice Black quite reasonably characterized the Court’s holding in&para;<br>Prima Paint as “fantastic,” id., at 407 (dissenting opinion), because the&para;<br>holding was, in his view, inconsistent with the text of §2 of the FAA,&para;<br>388 U. S., at 412, as well as the intent of the draftsmen of the legisla&para;<br>tion, id., at 413–416. Nevertheless, the narrow holding in that case has&para;<br>been followed numerous times, see Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v.&para;<br>Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440 (2006), and Preston v. Ferrer, 552 U.

In the latter circumstance,&para;<br>we assume there is no infirmity per se with the arbitration&para;<br>agreement, i.e., there are no grounds for revocation of the&para;<br>arbitration agreement itself under §2 of the FAA. Accord&para;<br>ingly, we commit the parties’ general contract dispute to&para;<br>the arbitrator, as agreed.&para;<br>The claim in Prima Paint was that one party would not&para;<br>have agreed to contract with the other for services had it&para;<br>known the second party was insolvent (a fact known but&para;<br>not disclosed at the time of contracting). 388 U. S., at 398.&para;<br>There was, therefore, allegedly fraud in the inducement of&para;<br>the contract—a contract which also delegated disputes to&para;<br>an arbitrator. Despite the fact that the claim raised would&para;<br>have, if successful, rendered the embedded arbitration&para;<br>clause void, the Court held that the merits of the dispute&para;<br>were for the arbitrator, so long as the claim of “fraud in&para;<br>the inducement” did not go to validity of “the arbitration&para;<br>clause itself.” Id., at 403 (emphasis added). Because, in&para;<br>Prima Paint, “no claim ha[d] been advanced by Prima&para;<br>Paint that [respondent] fraudulently induced it to enter&para;<br>into the agreement to arbitrate,” and because the arbitra&para;<br>tion agreement was broad enough to cover the dispute, the&para;<br>arbitration agreement was enforceable with respect to the&para;<br>controversy at hand. Id., at 406.&para;<br>The Prima Paint rule has been denominated as one&para;<br>related to severability. Our opinion in Buckeye, set out&para;<br>these guidelines:&para;<br>“First, as a matter of substantive federal arbitration&para;<br>law, an arbitration provision is severable from the&para;<br>remainder of the contract. Second, unless the chal&para;<br>lenge is to the arbitration clause itself, the issue of the&para;<br>contract’s validity is considered by the arbitrator in&para;<br>the first instance.” 546 U. S., at 445–446.&para;<br>Whether the general contract defense renders the entire&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>agreement void or voidable is irrelevant. Id., at 446. All&para;<br>that matters is whether the party seeking to present the&para;<br>issue to a court has brought a “discrete challenge,” Preston&para;<br>v. Ferrer, 552 U. S. 346, 354 (2008), “to the validity of the&para;<br>. . . arbitration clause.” Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 449.&para;<br>Prima Paint and its progeny allow a court to pluck from&para;<br>a potentially invalid contract a potentially valid arbitra&para;<br>tion agreement. Today the Court adds a new layer of&para;<br>severability—something akin to Russian nesting dolls—&para;<br>into the mix: Courts may now pluck from a potentially&para;<br>invalid arbitration agreement even narrower provisions&para;<br>that refer particular arbitrability disputes to an arbitra&para;<br>tor. See ante, at 6–7. I do not think an agreement to&para;<br>arbitrate can ever manifest a clear and unmistakable&para;<br>intent to arbitrate its own validity. But even assuming&para;<br>otherwise, I certainly would not hold that the Prima Paint&para;<br>rule extends this far.&para;<br>In my view, a general revocation challenge to a stand&para;<br>alone arbitration agreement is, invariably, a challenge to&para;<br>the “ ‘making’ ” of the arbitration agreement itself, Prima&para;<br>Paint, 388 U. S., at 403, and therefore, under Prima Paint,&para;<br>must be decided by the court. A claim of procedural un&para;<br>conscionability aims to undermine the formation of the&para;<br>arbitration agreement, much like a claim of unconscion&para;<br>ability aims to undermine the clear-and-unmistakable&para;<br>intent requirement necessary for a valid delegation of a&para;<br>“discrete” challenge to the validity of the arbitration agree&para;<br>ment itself, Preston, 552 U. S., at 354. Moreover, because&para;<br>we are dealing in this case with a challenge to an inde&para;<br>pendently executed arbitration agreement—rather than a&para;<br>clause contained in a contract related to another subject&para;<br>matter—any challenge to the contract itself is also, neces&para;<br>sarily, a challenge to the arbitration agreement.9 They are&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 As respondent asserted in his opposition to petitioner’s motion to&para;<br>compel arbitration, “the lack of mutuality regarding the type of claims&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>one and the same.&para;<br>The Court, however, reads the delegation clause as a&para;<br>distinct mini-arbitration agreement divisible from the&para;<br>contract in which it resides—which just so happens also to&para;<br>be an arbitration agreement. Ante, at 6–7. Although the&para;<br>Court simply declares that it “makes no difference” that&para;<br>the underlying subject matter of the agreement is itself an&para;<br>arbitration agreement, ante, at 7, that proposition does not&para;<br>follow from—rather it is at odds with—Prima Paint’s&para;<br>severability rule.&para;<br>Had the parties in this case executed only one contract,&para;<br>on two sheets of paper—one sheet with employment&para;<br>terms, and a second with arbitration terms—the contract&para;<br>would look much like the one in Buckeye. There would be&para;<br>some substantive terms, followed by some arbitration&para;<br>terms, including what we now call a delegation clause—&para;<br>i.e., a sentence or two assigning to the arbitrator any&para;<br>disputes related to the validity of the arbitration provi&para;<br>sion. See Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 442. If respondent then&para;<br>came into court claiming that the contract was illegal as a&para;<br>whole for some reason unrelated to the arbitration provi&para;<br>sion, the Prima Paint rule would apply, and such a gen&para;<br>eral challenge to the subject matter of the contract would&para;<br>go to the arbitrator. Such a challenge would not call into&para;<br>question the making of the arbitration agreement or its&para;<br>invalidity per se.&para;<br>Before today, however, if respondent instead raised a&para;<br>challenge specific to “the validity of the agreement to&para;<br>arbitrate”—for example, that the agreement to arbitrate&para;<br>was void under state law—the challenge would have gone&para;<br>to the court. That is what Buckeye says. See 546 U. S., at&para;<br>444. But the Court now declares that Prima Paint’s plead&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>that must be arbitrated, the fee provision, and the discovery provision, &para;<br>&para;<br>so permeate the Defendant’s arbitration agreement that it would be&para;<br>&para;<br>impossible to sever the offending provisions.” App. 45. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ing rule requires more: A party must lodge a challenge&para;<br>with even greater specificity than what would have satis&para;<br>fied the Prima Paint Court. A claim that an entire arbi&para;<br>tration agreement is invalid will not go to the court unless&para;<br>the party challenges the particular sentences that delegate&para;<br>such claims to the arbitrator, on some contract ground&para;<br>that is particular and unique to those sentences. See ante,&para;<br>at 8–10.&para;<br>It would seem the Court reads Prima Paint to require,&para;<br>as a matter of course, infinite layers of severability: We&para;<br>must always pluck from an arbitration agreement the&para;<br>specific delegation mechanism that would—but for present&para;<br>judicial review—commend the matter to arbitration, even&para;<br>if this delegation clause is but one sentence within one&para;<br>paragraph within a standalone agreement. And, most&para;<br>importantly, the party must identify this one sentence and&para;<br>lodge a specific challenge to its validity. Otherwise, he&para;<br>will be bound to pursue his validity claim in arbitration.&para;<br>Even if limited to separately executed arbitration&para;<br>agreements, however, such an infinite severability rule is&para;<br>divorced from the underlying rationale of Prima Paint.&para;<br>The notion that a party may be bound by an arbitration&para;<br>clause in a contract that is nevertheless invalid may be&para;<br>difficult for any lawyer—or any person—to accept, but this&para;<br>is the law of Prima Paint. It reflects a judgment that the&para;<br>“ ‘national policy favoring arbitration,’ ” Preston, 552 U. S.,&para;<br>at 353, outweighs the interest in preserving a judicial&para;<br>forum for questions of arbitrability—but only when ques&para;<br>tions of arbitrability are bound up in an underlying dis&para;<br>pute. Prima Paint, 388 U. S., at 404. When the two are so&para;<br>bound up, there is actually no gateway matter at all: The&para;<br>question “Who decides” is the entire ball game. Were a&para;<br>court to decide the fraudulent inducement question in&para;<br>Prima Paint, in order to decide the antecedent question of&para;<br>the validity of the included arbitration agreement, then it&para;<br>would also, necessarily, decide the merits of the underly&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ing dispute. Same, too, for the question of illegality in&para;<br>Buckeye; on its way to deciding the arbitration agree&para;<br>ment’s validity, the court would have to decide whether&para;<br>the contract was illegal, and in so doing, it would decide&para;<br>the merits of the entire dispute.&para;<br>In this case, however, resolution of the unconscionability&para;<br>question will have no bearing on the merits of the underly&para;<br>ing employment dispute. It will only, as a preliminary&para;<br>matter, resolve who should decide the merits of that dis&para;<br>pute. Resolution of the unconscionability question will,&para;<br>however, decide whether the arbitration agreement itself&para;<br>is “valid” under “such grounds as exist at law or in equity&para;<br>for the revocation of any contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2. As&para;<br>Prima Paint recognizes, the FAA commits those gateway&para;<br>matters, specific to the arbitration agreement, to the&para;<br>court. 388 U. S., at 403–404. Indeed, it is clear that the&para;<br>present controversy over whether the arbitration agree&para;<br>ment is unconscionable is itself severable from the merits&para;<br>of the underlying dispute, which involves a claim of em&para;<br>ployment discrimination. This is true for all gateway&para;<br>matters, and for this reason Prima Paint has no applica&para;<br>tion in this case.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>While I may have to accept the “fantastic” holding in&para;<br>Prima Paint, id., at 407 (Black, J., dissenting), I most&para;<br>certainly do not accept the Court’s even more fantastic&para;<br>reasoning today. I would affirm the judgment of the Court&para;<br>of Appeals, and therefore respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
