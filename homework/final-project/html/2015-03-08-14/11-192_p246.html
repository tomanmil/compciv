S. C.&para;<br>§1681 et seq. He sought damages under §1681n and asserted jurisdiction under §1681p, as well as under the Little Tucker Act, which&para;<br>grants district courts “original jurisdiction, concurrent with the United States Court of Federal Claims, of . . . [a]ny. . . civil action or claim&para;<br>against the United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded&para;<br>. . . upon . . . any Act of Congress,” 28 U. S. C. §1346(a)(2). In dismissing the suit, the District Court held that FCRA did not explicitly&para;<br>waive the Federal Government’s sovereign immunity. Bormes appealed to the Federal Circuit, which vacated the District Court’s decision, holding that the Little Tucker Act provided the Government’s&para;<br>consent to suit because the underlying statute—FCRA—could fairly&para;<br>be interpreted as mandating a right of recovery in damages.&para;<br>Held: The Little Tucker Act does not waive the Government’s sovereign&para;<br>immunity with respect to FCRA damages actions. Pp. 4–11.&para;<br>(a) The Little Tucker Act and its companion statute, the Tucker&para;<br>Act, provide the Federal Government’s consent to suit for certain&para;<br>money-damages claims “premised on other sources of law,” United&para;<br>States v. Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. 287, 290. The general terms of the&para;<br>Tucker Acts are displaced, however, when a law imposing monetary&para;<br>liability has its own judicial remedies. In that event, the specific remedial scheme establishes the exclusive framework for determining&para;<br>the scope of liability under the statute. See, e.g., Hinck v. United&para;<br>States, 550 U.

Its detailed remedial scheme sets “out&para;<br>a carefully circumscribed, time-limited, plaintiff-specific” cause of action, and “also precisely define[s] the appropriate forum,” 550 U.

FCRA authorizes aggrieved consumers to hold “any person”&para;<br>who “willfully” or “negligent[ly]” fails to comply with the Act’s requirements liable for specified damages, 15 U. S. C. §§1681n(a),&para;<br>1681o; requires enforcement claims to be brought within a specified&para;<br>limitations period, §1681p; and provides that jurisdiction will lie “in&para;<br>any appropriate United States district court, without regard to the&para;<br>amount in controversy,” ibid.

[a]ny. . . civil action or claim against the&para;<br>United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded&para;<br>. . . upon . . . any Act of Congress.” We consider whether&para;<br>the Little Tucker Act waives the sovereign immunity of&para;<br>the United States with respect to damages actions for&para;<br>violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15&para;<br>U. S. C. §1681 et seq.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Fair Credit Reporting Act has as one of its purposes&para;<br>to “protect consumer privacy.” Safeco Ins. Co. of America&para;<br>v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 52 (2007); see 84 Stat. 1128, 15&para;<br>U. S. C. §1681. To that end, FCRA provides, among other&para;<br>things, that “no person that accepts credit cards or debit&para;<br>cards for the transaction of business shall print more than&para;<br>the last 5 digits of the card number or the expiration date&para;<br>upon any receipt provided to the cardholder at the point of&para;<br>the sale or transaction.” §1681c(g)(1) (emphasis added).&para;<br>The Act defines “person” as “any individual, partnership,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. BORMES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>corporation, trust, estate, cooperative, association, government or governmental subdivision or agency, or other&para;<br>entity.” §1681a(b).&para;<br>FCRA imposes civil liability for willful or negligent&para;<br>noncompliance with its requirements: “Any person who&para;<br>willfully fails to comply” with the Act “with respect to any&para;<br>consumer,” “is liable to that consumer” for actual damages&para;<br>or damages “of not less than $100 and not more than&para;<br>$1,000,” as well as punitive damages, attorney’s fees, and&para;<br>costs. §1681n(a); see also §1681o (civil liability for negligent noncompliance). The Act includes a jurisdictional&para;<br>provision, which provides that “[a]n action to enforce any&para;<br>liability created under this subchapter may be brought&para;<br>in any appropriate United States district court, without&para;<br>regard to the amount in controversy, or in any other court&para;<br>of competent jurisdiction” within the earlier of “2 years&para;<br>after the date of discovery by the plaintiff of the violation&para;<br>that is the basis for such liability” or “5 years after the&para;<br>date on which the violation that is the basis for such liability occurs.” §1681p.&para;<br>Respondent James X. Bormes is an attorney who filed&para;<br>a putative class action against the United States in the&para;<br>United States District Court for the Northern District of&para;<br>Illinois seeking damages under FCRA. Bormes alleged&para;<br>that he paid a $350 federal-court filing fee for a client&para;<br>using his own credit card on Pay.gov, an Internet-based&para;<br>system used by federal courts and dozens of federal agencies to process online payment transactions. According&para;<br>to Bormes, his Pay.gov electronic receipt included the last&para;<br>four digits of his credit card, in addition to its expiration&para;<br>date, in willful violation of §1681c(g)(1). He claimed that&para;<br>he and thousands of similarly situated persons were entitled to recover damages under §1681n, and asserted jurisdiction under §1681p, as well as under the Little Tucker&para;<br>Act, 28 U. S. C. §1346(a)(2).&para;<br>The District Court dismissed the suit, holding that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>FCRA does not contain the explicit waiver of sovereign&para;<br>immunity necessary to permit a damages suit against the&para;<br>United States. 638 F. Supp. 2d 958, 962 (ND Ill. 2009).&para;<br>The court did not address the Little Tucker Act as an&para;<br>asserted basis for jurisdiction. Respondent appealed to&para;<br>the Federal Circuit, which has exclusive jurisdiction “of an&para;<br>appeal from a final decision of a district court of the&para;<br>United States . . . if the jurisdiction of that court was&para;<br>based, in whole or in part, on” the Little Tucker Act. 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §1295(a)(2). Arguing that the Little Tucker Act’s&para;<br>jurisdictional grant did not apply to respondent’s suit,&para;<br>the Government moved to transfer the appeal to the&para;<br>Seventh Circuit.&para;<br>The Federal Circuit denied the transfer motion and&para;<br>went on to vacate the District Court’s decision. Without&para;<br>deciding whether FCRA itself contained the requisite&para;<br>waiver of sovereign immunity, the court held that the&para;<br>Little Tucker Act provided the Government’s consent to&para;<br>suit for violation of FCRA. The court explained that the&para;<br>Little Tucker Act applied because FCRA “ ‘can fairly be&para;<br>interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal&para;<br>Government for the damage sustained.’ ” 626 F. 3d 574,&para;<br>578 (2010) (quoting United States v. White Mountain&para;<br>Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 472 (2003)). This “fair interpretation” rule, the court explained, “demands a showing&para;<br>‘demonstrably lower’ than the initial waiver of sovereign&para;<br>immunity” contained in the Little Tucker Act itself. 626&para;<br>F. 3d, at 578. The court reasoned that FCRA satisfied the&para;<br>“fair interpretation” rule because its damages provision&para;<br>applies to “any person” who willfully violates its requirements, 15 U. S. C. §1681n(a), and the Act elsewhere defines “person” to include “any . . . government,” §1681a(b).&para;<br>626 F. 3d, at 580. The Federal Circuit remanded to the&para;<br>District Court for further proceedings. We granted certiorari, 565 U. S. ___ (2012).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. BORMES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>Sovereign immunity shields the United States from suit&para;<br>absent a consent to be sued that is “ ‘unequivocally expressed.’ ” United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S.&para;<br>30, 33–34 (1992) (quoting Irwin v. Department of Veterans&para;<br>Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95 (1990); some internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). The Little Tucker Act is one statute that&para;<br>unequivocally provides the Federal Government’s consent&para;<br>to suit for certain money-damages claims. United States v.&para;<br>Mitchell, 463 U. S. 206, 216 (1983) (Mitchell II ). Subject&para;<br>to exceptions not relevant here, the Little Tucker Act&para;<br>provides that “district courts shall have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the United States Court of Federal&para;<br>Claims,” of a “civil action or claim against the United&para;<br>States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded either&para;<br>upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress, or any&para;<br>regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for&para;<br>liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding&para;<br>in tort.” 28 U. S. C. §1346(a)(2).1 The Little Tucker Act&para;<br>and its companion statute, the Tucker Act, §1491(a)(1),2&para;<br>do not themselves “creat[e] substantive rights,” but “are&para;<br>simply jurisdictional provisions that operate to waive&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 It is undisputed that this class action satisfied the Little Tucker&para;<br>Act’s amount-in-controversy limitation. We have held that to require&para;<br>only that the “claims of individual members of the clas[s] do not exceed&para;<br>$10,000.” United States v. Will, 449 U. S. 200, 211, n. 10 (1980).&para;<br>2 Whereas the Little Tucker Act creates jurisdiction in the district&para;<br>courts concurrent with the Court of Federal Claims for covered claims&para;<br>of $10,000 or less, the Tucker Act assigns jurisdiction to the Court of&para;<br>Federal Claims regardless of monetary amount. As relevant here, the&para;<br>scope of the two statutes is otherwise the same. The third statute in&para;<br>the Tucker Act trio, the Indian Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. §1505, “confers a&para;<br>like waiver for Indian tribal claims that ‘otherwise would be cognizable&para;<br>in the Court of Federal Claims if the claimant were not an Indian&para;<br>tribe.’ ” United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465,&para;<br>472 (2003) (quoting §1505).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. 287,&para;<br>290 (2009).&para;<br>Bormes argues that whether or not FCRA itself unambiguously waives sovereign immunity, the Little Tucker Act&para;<br>authorizes his FCRA damages claim against the United&para;<br>States. The question, then, is whether a damages claim&para;<br>under FCRA “falls within the terms of the Tucker Act,” so&para;<br>that “the United States has presumptively consented to&para;<br>suit.” Mitchell II, supra, at 216. It does not. Where, as in&para;<br>FCRA, a statute contains its own self-executing remedial&para;<br>scheme, we look only to that statute to determine whether&para;<br>Congress intended to subject the United States to damages liability.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Court of Claims was established, and the Tucker&para;<br>Act enacted, to open a judicial avenue for certain monetary claims against the United States. Before the creation&para;<br>of the Court of Claims in 1855, see Act of Feb. 24, 1855&para;<br>(1855 Act), ch. 122, §1, 10 Stat. 612, it was not uncommon&para;<br>for statutes to impose monetary obligations on the United&para;<br>States without specifying a means of judicial enforcement.3 As a result, claimants routinely petitioned Congress for private bills to recover money owed by the Federal&para;<br>Government. See Mitchell II, supra, at 212 (citing P.&para;<br>Bator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro &amp; H. Wechsler, Hart and&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 For example, the Act of March 30, 1814, provided that every noncommissioned U. S. army officer who “may be captured by the enemy,&para;<br>shall be entitled to receive during his captivity . . . the same pay,&para;<br>subsistence, and allowance to which he may be entitled whilst in the&para;<br>actual service of the United States.” §14, 3 Stat. 115, repealed in 1962&para;<br>by Pub. L. 87–649, §14, 76 Stat. 498. The 1814 Act clearly “command[ed] the payment of a specified amount of money by the United&para;<br>States,” Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S. 879, 923 (1988) (SCALIA, J.,&para;<br>dissenting), but did not designate a means of judicial relief in the event&para;<br>the Government failed to pay.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. BORMES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 98&para;<br>(2d ed. 1973)). As this individualized legislative process&para;<br>became increasingly burdensome for Congress, the Court&para;<br>of Claims was created “to relieve the pressure on Congress&para;<br>caused by the volume of private bills.” Glidden Co. v.&para;<br>Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530, 552 (1962) (plurality opinion). The&para;<br>1855 Act authorized the Court of Claims to hear claims&para;<br>against the United States “founded upon any law of Congress,” §1, 10 Stat. 612, and thus allowed claimants to&para;<br>sue the Federal Government for monetary relief premised&para;<br>on other sources of law. (Specialized legislation remained&para;<br>necessary to authorize the payments approved by the&para;<br>Court of Claims until 1863, when Congress empowered the&para;<br>court to enter final judgments. See Act of Mar. 3, 1863&para;<br>(1863 Act), ch. 92, 12 Stat. 765; Mitchell II, supra, at 212–&para;<br>214 (recounting the history of the Court of Claims)).&para;<br>Enacted in 1887, the Tucker Act was the successor&para;<br>statute to the 1855 and 1863 Acts and replaced most of&para;<br>their provisions. See Act of Mar. 3, 1887 (1887 Act), ch.&para;<br>359, 24 Stat. 505; Mitchell II, supra, at 213–214. Like the&para;<br>1855 Act before it, the Tucker Act provided the Federal&para;<br>Government’s consent to suit in the Court of Claims for&para;<br>claims “founded upon . . . any law of Congress.” 1887 Act&para;<br>§1, 24 Stat. 505. Section 2 of the 1887 Act created concurrent jurisdiction in the district courts for claims of up to&para;<br>$1,000. The Tucker Act’s jurisdictional grant, and accompanying immunity waiver, supplied the missing ingredient&para;<br>for an action against the United States for the breach of&para;<br>monetary obligations not otherwise judicially enforceable.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 For purposes of this case, the current versions of the Tucker Act and&para;<br>Little Tucker Act resemble the 1887 Act. Compare 28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(1)&para;<br>(permitting suits “founded . . . upon . . . any Act of Congress”) with&para;<br>Tucker Act §1, 24 Stat. 505 (permitting suits “founded upon . . . any law&para;<br>of Congress, except for pensions”). The prior functions of the Court of&para;<br>Claims are now divided between the Court of Federal Claims at the&para;<br>trial level and the Federal Circuit at the appellate.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

In that event, the&para;<br>specific remedial scheme establishes the exclusive framework for the liability Congress created under the statute.&para;<br>Because a “precisely drawn, detailed statute pre-empts&para;<br>more general remedies,” Hinck v. United States, 550 U. S.&para;<br>501, 506 (2007) (quoting EC Term of Years Trust v. United&para;<br>States, 550 U. S. 429, 434 (2007); internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted), FCRA’s self-executing remedial scheme supersedes the gap-filling role of the Tucker Act.&para;<br>We have long recognized that an additional remedy in&para;<br>the Court of Claims is foreclosed when it contradicts the&para;<br>limits of a precise remedial scheme. In Nichols v. United&para;<br>States, 7 Wall. 122, 131 (1869), the issue was whether the&para;<br>1855 Act authorized suit in the Court of Claims for improper assessment of duties on imported liquor that had&para;<br>already been paid without protest. The Court held that it&para;<br>did not. The revenue laws already provided a remedy: An&para;<br>aggrieved merchant could sue to recover the tax, but only&para;<br>after paying the duty under protest. Act of Feb. 26, 1845,&para;<br>ch. 22, 5 Stat. 727. The Court rejected the supposition&para;<br>that “Congress, after having carefully constructed a revenue system, with ample provisions to redress wrong,&para;<br>intended to give to the taxpayer and importer a further&para;<br>and different remedy.” 7 Wall., at 131. Permitting suit&para;<br>under the 1855 Act, the Court concluded, would frustrate&para;<br>congressional intent with respect to the specific remedial&para;<br>scheme already in place. The 1855 Act was confined to a&para;<br>gap-filling role. As we said in a later case, “the general&para;<br>laws which govern the Court of Claims may be resorted&para;<br>to for relief ” only because “[n]o special remedy has been&para;<br>provided” to enforce a payment to which the claimant was&para;<br>entitled. United States v. Kaufman, 96 U. S. 567, 569&para;<br>(1878). Where the “liability is one created by statute,” the&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. BORMES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“special remedy provided by the same statute is exclusive.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>Our more recent cases have consistently held that statutory schemes with their own remedial framework exclude&para;<br>alternative relief under the general terms of the Tucker&para;<br>Act. See, e.g., Hinck, supra; United States v. Fausto, 484&para;<br>U. S. 439 (1988); United States v. Erika, Inc., 456 U. S.&para;<br>201 (1982). Respondent contends that in each of those&para;<br>cases Congress had unambiguously demonstrated its&para;<br>intent to foreclose additional review by the Court of Federal Claims—whereas here, no similar intent to preclude&para;<br>Tucker Act jurisdiction is apparent. See Brief for Respondent 27–28. But our precedents collectively stand for&para;<br>a more basic proposition: Where a specific statutory&para;<br>scheme provides the accoutrements of a judicial action, the&para;<br>metes and bounds of the liability Congress intended to&para;<br>create can only be divined from the text of the statute&para;<br>itself.5&para;<br>In Hinck, for example, we held that the Tax Court provides the exclusive forum for suits under 26 U. S. C.&para;<br>§6404(h), which authorizes judicial review of the Secretary’s decision not to abate interest under §6404(e)(1). We&para;<br>relied on “our past recognition that when Congress enacts&para;<br>a specific remedy when no remedy was previously recognized . . . the remedy provided is generally regarded as&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 We therefore need not resolve the parties’ disagreement about&para;<br>whether certain inconsistencies between the Little Tucker Act and&para;<br>FCRA can be reconciled. Compare 28 U. S. C. §1346(a)(2) (no claims in&para;<br>district court “exceeding $10,000 in amount”) with 15 U. S. C. §1681p&para;<br>(claims may be brought in district court “without regard to the amount&para;<br>in controversy”); compare 28 U. S. C. §2501 (claims must be filed in the&para;<br>Court of Federal Claims within six years of accrual) with 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1681p (claims under FCRA must be filed within the earlier of two&para;<br>years after discovery or five years after the alleged violation). Reconcilable or not, FCRA governs. The Government also contends that the&para;<br>Tucker Act does not apply because §§1681n and 1681o sound in tort.&para;<br>We do not decide the merits of that alternative argument.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>exclusive.” 550 U. S., at 506. Section 6404(h), we concluded, “fits the bill”: it “provides a forum for adjudication,&para;<br>a limited class of potential plaintiffs, a statute of limitations, a standard of review, and authorization for judicial&para;<br>relief.” Ibid. It did not matter that Congress “fail[ed]&para;<br>explicitly to define the Tax Court’s jurisdiction as exclusive.” Ibid. We found it “quite plain that the terms of&para;<br>§6404(h)—a ‘precisely drawn, detailed statute’ filling a&para;<br>perceived hole in the law—control all requests for review&para;<br>of §6404(e)(1) determinations.” Ibid.&para;<br>Like §6404(h), FCRA creates a detailed remedial&para;<br>scheme. Its provisions “set out a carefully circumscribed,&para;<br>time-limited, plaintiff-specific” cause of action, and “also&para;<br>precisely define the appropriate forum.” Id., at 507. It&para;<br>authorizes aggrieved consumers to hold “any person” who&para;<br>“willfully” or “negligent[ly]” fails to comply with the Act’s&para;<br>requirements liable for specified damages. 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§1681n(a), 1681o. Claims to enforce liability must be&para;<br>brought within a specified limitations period, §1681p, and&para;<br>jurisdiction will lie “in any appropriate United States district court, without regard to the amount in controversy,&para;<br>or in any other court of competent jurisdiction.” Ibid.&para;<br>Without resort to the Tucker Act, FCRA enables claimants&para;<br>to pursue in court the monetary relief contemplated by the&para;<br>statute.&para;<br>Plaintiffs cannot, therefore, mix and match FCRA’s&para;<br>provisions with the Little Tucker Act’s immunity waiver to&para;<br>create an action against the United States. Since FCRA&para;<br>is a detailed remedial scheme, only its own text can determine whether the damages liability Congress crafted&para;<br>extends to the Federal Government. To hold otherwise—&para;<br>to permit plaintiffs to remedy the absence of a waiver of&para;<br>sovereign immunity in specific, detailed statutes by pleading general Tucker Act jurisdiction—would transform the&para;<br>sovereign-immunity landscape.&para;<br>The Federal Circuit was therefore wrong to conclude&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. BORMES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that the Tucker Act justified applying a “less stringent”&para;<br>sovereign-immunity analysis to FCRA than our cases&para;<br>require. 626 F. 3d, at 582. It distorted our case law in&para;<br>applying to FCRA the immunity-waiver standard we&para;<br>expressed in White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S., at&para;<br>472: whether the statute “ ‘can fairly be interpreted as&para;<br>mandating compensation by the Federal Government for&para;<br>the damage sustained.’ ” 626 F. 3d, at 578. That is the&para;<br>test for determining whether a statute that imposes an&para;<br>obligation but does not provide the elements of a cause of&para;<br>action qualifies for suit under the Tucker Act—more specifically, whether the failure to perform an obligation&para;<br>undoubtedly imposed on the Federal Government creates&para;<br>a right to monetary relief. See White Mountain Apache&para;<br>Tribe, supra; Mitchell II, 463 U. S. 206. That test is not&para;<br>relevant when a “mandate of compensation” is contained&para;<br>in a statute that provides a detailed judicial remedy&para;<br>against those who are subject to its requirements. FCRA&para;<br>is such a statute. By using the “fair interpretation” test to&para;<br>determine whether FCRA’s civil liability provisions apply&para;<br>to the United States, the Federal Circuit directed the test&para;<br>to a purpose for which it was not designed and leapfrogged&para;<br>the threshold concern that the Tucker Act cannot be superimposed on an existing remedial scheme.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>We do not decide here whether FCRA itself waives the&para;<br>Federal Government’s immunity to damages actions under&para;<br>§1681n. That question is for the Seventh Circuit to consider once this case is transferred to it on remand. But&para;<br>whether or not FCRA contains the necessary waiver of&para;<br>immunity, any attempt to append a Tucker Act remedy to&para;<br>the statute’s existing remedial scheme interferes with its&para;<br>intended scope of liability.&para;<br>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and&para;<br>the case remanded with instructions to transfer the case to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit&para;<br>for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
