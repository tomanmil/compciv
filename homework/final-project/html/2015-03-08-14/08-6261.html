When we granted&para;<br>certiorari, we rephrased the question presented to focus on&para;<br>that issue: “Whether an action for criminal contempt in a&para;<br>congressionally created court may constitutionally be&para;<br>brought in the name and pursuant to the power of a pri&para;<br>vate person, rather than in the name and pursuant to the&para;<br>power of the United States.” 558 U. S ___ (2009). The&para;<br>answer to that question is no. The terrifying force of the&para;<br>criminal justice system may only be brought to bear&para;<br>against an individual by society as a whole, through a&para;<br>prosecution brought on behalf of the government. The&para;<br>court below held otherwise, relying on a dissenting opinion&para;<br>in one of our cases, and on the litigating position of the&para;<br>United States, which the Solicitor General has properly&para;<br>abandoned in this Court. See Brief for United States as&para;<br>Amicus Curiae 12–13, n. 3. We should correct the lower&para;<br>court’s error and return the case to that court to resolve&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the remaining questions.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In March 1999, Wykenna Watson was assaulted by her&para;<br>then-boyfriend, John Robertson. App. 40. Watson sought&para;<br>and secured a civil protective order against Robertson,&para;<br>prohibiting him from approaching within 100 feet of her&para;<br>and from assaulting, threatening, harassing, physically&para;<br>abusing, or contacting her. Id., at 20. At the same time,&para;<br>the United States Attorney’s Office (USAO) was independ&para;<br>ently pursuing criminal charges against Robertson arising&para;<br>from the assault.&para;<br>On June 26, Robertson violated the protective order by&para;<br>again violently assaulting Watson. On July 8, he was&para;<br>indicted for the previous March incident; shortly thereaf&para;<br>ter, the USAO offered, and Robertson accepted, a plea&para;<br>agreement resolving those charges. Id., at 26–30. At the&para;<br>top of the boilerplate plea form, the Assistant U. S. Attor&para;<br>ney added in longhand: “In exchange for Mr. Robertson’s&para;<br>plea of guilty to attempt[ed] aggravated assault, the gov’t&para;<br>agrees to: DISMISS the [remaining] charges[,] [and] [n]ot&para;<br>pursue any charges concerning an incident on 6-26-99.”&para;<br>Id., at 28. The Superior Court accepted Robertson’s plea&para;<br>and sentenced him to 1 to 3 years’ imprisonment. Id., at&para;<br>30, 46, 53.&para;<br>A few months later, Watson filed a motion to initiate&para;<br>criminal contempt proceedings against Robertson for&para;<br>violating the civil protective order, based on the June 26&para;<br>assault. See D. C. Code §16–1005(f) (2009 Supp.); D. C.&para;<br>Super. Ct. Domestic Violence Rule 12(d) (Lexis 2010); In re&para;<br>Robertson, 940 A. 2d 1050, 1053 (D. C. 2008). After a 2&para;<br>day bench trial, the court found Robertson guilty on three&para;<br>counts of criminal contempt and sentenced him to three&para;<br>consecutive 180-day terms of imprisonment, suspending&para;<br>execution of the last in favor of five years’ probation. The&para;<br>court also ordered Robertson to pay Watson roughly&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>$10,000 in restitution. App. 2, 63–64. Robertson filed a&para;<br>motion to vacate the judgment, which the court denied.&para;<br>Robertson appealed. Criminal contempt prosecutions,&para;<br>he argued, “are between the public and the defendant,”&para;<br>and thus could “only be brought in the name of the rele&para;<br>vant sovereign, . . . the United States.” Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>8, 10 (quoting Brief for Appellant in No. 00–FM–1269 etc.&para;<br>(D. C.), pp. 20–21, and 940 A. 2d, at 1057; internal quota&para;<br>tion marks omitted). So viewed, the prosecution based on&para;<br>the June 26 incident could not be brought, because the&para;<br>plea agreement barred the “gov[ernmen]t” from pursuing&para;<br>any charges arising from that incident.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals rejected Robertson’s arguments, in&para;<br>a two-step holding. Step one: “the criminal contempt&para;<br>prosecution in this case was conducted as a private action&para;<br>brought in the name and interest of Ms. Watson, not as a&para;<br>public action brought in the name and interest of the&para;<br>United States or any other governmental entity.” 940&para;<br>A. 2d, at 1057–1058 (internal quotation marks and brack&para;<br>ets omitted). Step two: because the criminal contempt&para;<br>prosecution was brought as an exercise of private power,&para;<br>that prosecution did not implicate a plea agreement that&para;<br>bound only the government. Id., at 1059–1060.&para;<br>We granted certiorari to review the first step of that&para;<br>holding.&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Our decision in United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688&para;<br>(1993), provides the answer to the question presented&para;<br>here. The question in Dixon was one of double jeopardy—&para;<br>whether a private party’s prosecution for criminal con&para;<br>tempt barred the Government’s subsequent prosecution&para;<br>for the “same criminal offense.” Id., at 696. The private&para;<br>prosecution in that case was brought under the same D. C.&para;<br>contempt law at issue here. Id., at 692 (citing D. C. Code&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>§16–1005 (1989)).&para;<br>We thought it “obvious” in Dixon that double jeopardy&para;<br>protections barred the Government’s subsequent prosecu&para;<br>tion. 509 U. S., at 696. The Double Jeopardy Clause, of&para;<br>course, bars the second prosecution for the same offense&para;<br>only if that prosecution is brought by the same sovereign&para;<br>as the first. See Heath v. Alabama, 474 U. S. 82, 88–89&para;<br>(1985). Thus, the only possible way the Government’s&para;<br>second prosecution could have offended the Double Jeop&para;<br>ardy Clause is if the Court understood the criminal con&para;<br>tempt prosecution to be the Government’s first prosecu&para;<br>tion—i.e., one brought on behalf of the Government. See&para;<br>United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 451 (1989) (“The&para;<br>protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause are not trig&para;<br>gered by litigation between private parties”), overruled on&para;<br>other grounds by Hudson v. United States, 522 U. S. 93&para;<br>(1997).&para;<br>That we treated the criminal contempt prosecution in&para;<br>Dixon as an exercise of government power should not be&para;<br>surprising. More than two centuries ago, Blackstone&para;<br>wrote that the king is “the proper person to prosecute for&para;<br>all public offenses and breaches of the peace, being the&para;<br>person injured in the eye of the law.” 1 W. Blackstone,&para;<br>Commentaries *268. Blackstone repeated that principle&para;<br>throughout his fourth book. See, e.g., 4 id., at *2, *8, *177.&para;<br>Not long after Blackstone, then-Representative John&para;<br>Marshall agreed, stating on the House floor that “adminis&para;<br>ter[ing] criminal judgment . . . is a duty to be performed at&para;<br>the demand of the nation, and with which the nation has a&para;<br>right to dispense. If judgment . . . is to be pronounced, it&para;<br>must be at the prosecution of the nation.” 10 Annals of&para;<br>Cong. 615 (1800).&para;<br>This principle has deep historical roots. See, e.g., 1 F.&para;<br>Wharton, Criminal Law §10, p. 11 (9th ed. 1885) (“Penal&para;<br>justice . . . is a distinctive prerogative of the State, to be&para;<br>exercised in the service [of] the State”); see also J. Locke,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Second Treatise of Civil Government §88, pp. 43–44 (J.&para;<br>Gough ed. 1947) (“[E]very man who has entered into civil&para;<br>society, and is become a member of any commonwealth,&para;<br>has thereby quitted his power to punish offences against&para;<br>the law of nature in prosecution of his own private judg&para;<br>ment[.] . . . [H]e has given a right to the commonwealth to&para;<br>employ his force for the execution of the judgments of the&para;<br>commonwealth” (footnote omitted)). As this Court has&para;<br>said before, “[c]rimes and offenses against the laws of any&para;<br>State can only be defined, prosecuted and pardoned by the&para;<br>sovereign authority of that State.” Huntington v. Attrill,&para;<br>146 U. S. 657, 669 (1892); see also Heath, supra, at 88&para;<br>(“The dual sovereignty doctrine [of the Double Jeopardy&para;<br>Clause] is founded on the common-law conception of crime&para;<br>as an offense against the sovereignty of the government”).&para;<br>These core principles are embodied in the Constitution.&para;<br>The protections our Bill of Rights affords those facing&para;<br>criminal prosecution apply to “any person,” “any criminal&para;<br>case,” and “all criminal prosecutions.” Amdts. 5, 6 (em&para;<br>phasis added). But those protections apply only against&para;<br>the government; “[i]ndividual invasion of individual rights”&para;<br>is not covered. Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 11 (1883)&para;<br>(Fourteenth Amendment). If the safeguards of the Bill of&para;<br>Rights are to be available in “all criminal prosecutions,”&para;<br>then any such prosecution must be considered to be one on&para;<br>behalf of the government—otherwise the constitutional&para;<br>limits do not apply. “The Constitution constrains govern&para;<br>mental action ‘by whatever instruments or in whatever&para;<br>modes that action may be taken,’ ” Lebron v. National&para;<br>Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 392 (1995)&para;<br>(quoting Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 346–347 (1880)),&para;<br>but the action still must be governmental action.&para;<br>The court below, however, rejected this understanding,&para;<br>concluding that Watson’s “criminal contempt prosecution”&para;<br>was not “a public action” but “a private action,” such that&para;<br>it was not covered by an agreement binding the govern&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ment. 940 A. 2d, at 1057–1058 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). But as we have explained, “[t]he purpose of a&para;<br>criminal court is not to provide a forum for the ascertain&para;<br>ment of private rights. Rather it is to vindicate the public&para;<br>interest in the enforcement of the criminal law while at&para;<br>the same time safeguarding the rights of the individual&para;<br>defendant.” Standefer v. United States, 447 U. S. 10, 25&para;<br>(1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>The holding below gives rise to a broad array of unset&para;<br>tling questions. Take the Due Process Clause. It guaran&para;<br>tees particular rights in criminal prosecutions because the&para;<br>prosecutor is a state actor, carrying out a “duty on the part&para;<br>of the Government.” Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 433&para;<br>(1995) (emphasis added). But if the criminal prosecution&para;<br>is instead viewed as “a private action,” not an exercise of&para;<br>sovereign power, how would those rights attach? Cf.&para;<br>DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., 489&para;<br>U. S. 189, 195–196 (1989). What about Brady v. Mary&para;<br>land, 373 U. S. 83 (1963)? The private prosecutor is likely&para;<br>to have evidence pertinent to the proceeding—particularly&para;<br>if, as here, the private prosecutor is also the victim of the&para;<br>crime. But if the prosecutor is not exercising governmen&para;<br>tal authority, what would be the constitutional basis for&para;<br>any Brady obligations? May the private prosecutor inter&para;<br>view the defendant without Miranda warnings, since she&para;<br>is not acting on behalf of any sovereign but only in a pri&para;<br>vate capacity? See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436&para;<br>(1966).&para;<br>Our entire criminal justice system is premised on the&para;<br>notion that a criminal prosecution pits the government&para;<br>against the governed, not one private citizen against&para;<br>another. The ruling below is a startling repudiation of&para;<br>that basic understanding.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Despite the foregoing, the Court of Appeals determined&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that Watson brought this criminal prosecution under her&para;<br>authority as a private citizen. 940 A. 2d, at 1058. To&para;<br>reach that conclusion, the court relied on Justice Black&para;<br>mun’s separate opinion in Dixon. See 940 A. 2d, at 1057&para;<br>(“As Justice Blackmun said in United States v. Dixon,&para;<br>criminal contempt is ‘a special situation.’ [Dixon, 509&para;<br>U. S., at 742 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and&para;<br>dissenting in part)]. . . . ‘[T]he purpose of contempt is not&para;<br>to punish an offense against the community at large but&para;<br>rather to punish the specific offense of disobeying a court&para;<br>order.’ [Ibid.]” (citation omitted)). In fact, the court&para;<br>quoted from Justice Blackmun’s separate opinion no fewer&para;<br>than four times. Id., at 1057.&para;<br>Justice Blackmun’s opinion, however, was a partial&para;<br>concurrence in the judgment and partial dissent, and it&para;<br>garnered only one vote. Moreover, the portion of the&para;<br>opinion relied upon by the court below was the dissenting&para;<br>part. A majority of the Court squarely rejected Justice&para;<br>Blackmun’s view, and did so in plain terms. See Dixon,&para;<br>509 U. S., at 699–701 (opinion of SCALIA, J., joined by&para;<br>KENNEDY, J.); see id., at 720 (White, J., joined by STEVENS&para;<br>and Souter, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dis&para;<br>senting in part).&para;<br>Before this Court, Watson understandably retreats from&para;<br>Justice Blackmun’s dissenting opinion. Instead, she ar&para;<br>gues that “[i]n England and in America at the time of the&para;<br>Founding, prosecutions by victims of crime and their&para;<br>families were the rule, not the exception.” Brief for Re&para;<br>spondent 38–39. But such prosecutions, though brought&para;<br>by a private party, were commonly understood as an&para;<br>exercise of sovereign power—the private party acting on&para;<br>behalf of the sovereign, seeking to vindicate a public&para;<br>wrong.&para;<br>In England, for example, private parties could initiate&para;<br>criminal prosecutions, but the Crown—entrusted with the&para;<br>constitutional responsibility for law enforcement—could&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>enter a nolle prosequi to halt the prosecution. See, e.g.,&para;<br>King v. Guerchy, 1 Black W. 545, 96 Eng. Rep. 315 (K. B.&para;<br>1765); King v. Fielding, 2 Burr. 719, 720, 97 Eng. Rep. 531&para;<br>(K. B. 1759); see also King v. State, 43 Fla. 211, 223, 31 So.&para;<br>254, 257 (1901) (Private prosecutions in England were&para;<br>understood to be “conducted on behalf of the crown by the&para;<br>privately retained counsel of private prosecutors”); P. Dev&para;<br>lin, The Criminal Prosecution in England 21 (1958).&para;<br>Watson’s arguments based on American precedent fail&para;<br>largely for the same reason: To say that private parties&para;<br>could (and still can, in some places) exercise some control&para;<br>over criminal prosecutions says nothing to rebut the&para;<br>widely accepted principle that those private parties neces&para;<br>sarily acted (and now act) on behalf of the sovereign. See,&para;<br>e.g., Cronan ex rel. State v. Cronan, 774 A. 2d 866, 877&para;<br>(R. I. 2001) (“[A]ttorneys conducting private prosecutions&para;<br>stand in the shoes of the state”); State v. Westbrook, 279&para;<br>N. C. 18, 36, 181 S. E. 2d 572, 583 (1971) (“The prosecut&para;<br>ing attorney, whether the solicitor or privately employed&para;<br>counsel, represents the State”); Sidman, The Outmoded&para;<br>Concept of Private Prosecution, 25 Am. U. L. Rev. 754, 774&para;<br>(1976) (“[T]he privately retained attorney becomes, in&para;<br>effect, a temporary public prosecutor”). Indeed, many of&para;<br>the state court authorities Watson herself cites expressly&para;<br>recognize this fundamental point. See, e.g., Katz v. Com&para;<br>monwealth, 379 Mass. 305, 312, 399 N. E. 2d 1055, 1060&para;<br>(1979) (“[I]t is clear with respect to the criminal aspects of&para;<br>the present case that the Commonwealth . . . is the ad&para;<br>verse party”).&para;<br>We have no need to take issue with that proposition, but&para;<br>this case is different. The whole point of the ruling below&para;<br>was that this was not a “public action” that happened to&para;<br>be litigated by a private party, but “a private action&para;<br>brought in the name and interest of [Ms.] Watson.” 940&para;<br>A. 2d, at 1057–1058. That holding was critical in explain&para;<br>ing why Watson’s criminal action was not barred by a plea&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>agreement that bound the government.&para;<br>Moving beyond criminal prosecutions generally, Watson&para;<br>next contends that contempt prosecutions are unique, and&para;<br>thus should be exempt from the general rule. See Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 24. If Watson means to argue that modern&para;<br>criminal contempts are not “crimes,” that view was&para;<br>squarely rejected by this Court in Bloom v. Illinois, 391&para;<br>U. S. 194 (1968). See id., at 199–200 (holding that a&para;<br>criminal contempt prosecution is a criminal prosecution&para;<br>for the purposes of the Sixth Amendment); see also id., at&para;<br>201 (“Criminal contempt is a crime in the ordinary sense”);&para;<br>United States v. Providence Journal Co., 485 U. S. 693,&para;<br>700 (1988) (“The fact that the allegedly criminal conduct&para;<br>concerns the violation of a court order instead of common&para;<br>law or a statutory prohibition does not render the prosecu&para;<br>tion any less an exercise of the sovereign power of the&para;<br>United States”).&para;<br>In any event, even if contempt prosecutions might not&para;<br>always count as “crimes,” this one undoubtedly does, as&para;<br>Watson herself concedes. Brief for Respondent 34 (“[T]his&para;<br>case was clearly a criminal contempt proceeding from&para;<br>beginning to end”). That concession is well taken, given&para;<br>that whether a particular punishment is criminal or civil&para;<br>is “a matter of statutory construction,” Hudson, 522 U. S.,&para;<br>at 99, and that the relevant provisions here make clear&para;<br>that contempt proceedings like this one are criminal, see&para;<br>D. C. Code §16–1005(f) (“[C]riminal contempt shall be&para;<br>punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment&para;<br>for not more than 180 days, or both”); see also D. C. Super.&para;<br>Ct. Domestic Violence Rule 12(d) (labeled “Motion to adju&para;<br>dicate criminal contempt,” and describing the violation as&para;<br>“criminal contempt”). As Justice Holmes put it for the&para;<br>Court: “These contempts are infractions of the law, visited&para;<br>with punishment as such. If such acts are not criminal,&para;<br>we are in error as to the most fundamental characteristic&para;<br>of crimes as that word has been understood in English&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>speech.” Gompers v. United States, 233 U. S. 604, 610&para;<br>(1914).&para;<br>The United States bears some responsibility for leading&para;<br>the court below astray. In that court, the Government&para;<br>argued that the criminal contempt prosecution was “ ‘a&para;<br>private action brought in the name and interest of [Ms.]&para;<br>Watson, not . . . a public action brought in the name and&para;<br>interest of the United States or any other governmental&para;<br>entity.’ ” 940 A. 2d, at 1056 (quoting Brief for United&para;<br>States in No. 00–FM–925 etc. (D. C.)). The court below&para;<br>quoted that precise language in stating its conclusion. See&para;<br>940 A. 2d, at 1057–1058 (same).&para;<br>Before this Court, the Solicitor General has properly&para;<br>abandoned that position, and does not defend the lower&para;<br>court’s decision on this issue. See Brief for United States&para;<br>as Amicus Curiae 12–13, n. 3 (“[T]he United States no&para;<br>longer believes the contempt prosecution at issue can be&para;<br>understood as a purely ‘private action’ ”). We should do&para;<br>our part and correct the ruling of the court below.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The ultimate issue in this case, of course, is whether the&para;<br>criminal contempt prosecution Watson initiated in Janu&para;<br>ary 2000 violated the plea agreement Robertson signed&para;<br>with the USAO in July 1999. The Court of Appeals said&para;<br>“no,” based solely on its determination that Watson was&para;<br>exercising private—not sovereign—power.&para;<br>With that&para;<br>determination in hand, the ultimate plea agreement ques&para;<br>tion was straightforward: If Watson was wielding purely&para;<br>private power, a plea agreement that by its terms bound&para;<br>only the “gov[ernmen]t” would not bind her.&para;<br>With a proper view of Watson’s role in this case, how&para;<br>ever, the plea agreement question becomes significantly&para;<br>more difficult. The Solicitor General argues that the&para;<br>agreement does not bar the contempt prosecution, even if&para;<br>that prosecution is correctly viewed as on behalf of the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sovereign. Id., at 29–32. The difficult aspects of that legal&para;<br>issue, however, should not cause us to shy away from&para;<br>answering the fundamental threshold question whether a&para;<br>criminal prosecution may be brought on behalf and in the&para;<br>interest of a private party. Having decided that threshold&para;<br>question in favor of Robertson, I would remand to the&para;<br>court below to consider the plea agreement from the&para;<br>proper starting point.&para;<br>In light of all the foregoing, it is worth stressing that the&para;<br>majority’s determination not to decide that question “car&para;<br>ries with it no implication whatever regarding the Court’s&para;<br>views on the merits.” Maryland v.
