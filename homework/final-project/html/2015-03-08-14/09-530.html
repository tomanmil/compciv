NELSON ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–530.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 5, 2010—Decided January 19, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a&para;<br>workforce of both federal civil servants and Government contract em&para;<br>ployees. Respondents are contract employees at NASA’s Jet Propul&para;<br>sion Laboratory (JPL), which is operated by the California Institute&para;<br>of Technology (Cal Tech). Respondents were not subject to Govern&para;<br>ment background checks at the time they were hired, but that&para;<br>changed when the President ordered the adoption of uniform identifi&para;<br>cation standards for both federal civil servants and contractor em&para;<br>ployees. The Department of Commerce mandated that contract em&para;<br>ployees with long-term access to federal facilities complete a standard&para;<br>background check, typically the National Agency Check with Inquir&para;<br>ies (NACI), by October 2007. NASA modified its contract with Cal&para;<br>Tech to reflect the new requirement, and JPL announced that em&para;<br>ployees who did not complete the NACI process in time would be de&para;<br>nied access to JPL and face termination by Cal Tech.&para;<br>The NACI process, long used for prospective civil servants, begins&para;<br>with the employee filling out a standard form (here, Standard Form&para;<br>85, the Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions (SF–85)). SF–85&para;<br>asks whether an employee has “used, possessed, supplied, or manu&para;<br>factured illegal drugs” in the last year. If so, the employee must pro&para;<br>vide details, including information about “treatment or counseling re&para;<br>ceived.” The employee must also sign a release authorizing the&para;<br>Government to obtain personal information from schools, employers,&para;<br>and others during its investigation. Once SF–85 is completed, the&para;<br>Government sends the employee’s references a questionnaire (Form&para;<br>42) that asks open-ended questions about whether they have “any&para;<br>reason to question” the employee’s “honesty or trustworthiness,” or&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NASA v. NELSON&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>have “adverse information” concerning a variety of other matters. All&para;<br>SF–85 and Form 42 responses are subject to the protections of the&para;<br>Privacy Act.&para;<br>With the deadline for completing the NACI process drawing near,&para;<br>respondents brought suit, claiming, as relevant here, that the back&para;<br>ground-check process violates a constitutional right to informational&para;<br>privacy. The District Court declined to issue a preliminary injunc&para;<br>tion, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. It held that SF–85’s inquiries&para;<br>into recent drug involvement furthered the Government’s interest in&para;<br>combating illegal-drug use, but that the drug “treatment or counsel&para;<br>ing” question furthered no legitimate interest and was thus likely to&para;<br>be held unconstitutional. It also held that Form 42’s open-ended&para;<br>questions were not narrowly tailored to meet the Government’s inter&para;<br>ests in verifying contractors’ identities and ensuring JPL’s security,&para;<br>and thus also likely violated respondents’ informational-privacy&para;<br>rights.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. In two cases decided over 30 years ago, this Court referred&para;<br>broadly to a constitutional privacy “interest in avoiding disclosure of&para;<br>personal matters.” Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599–600; Nixon v.&para;<br>Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 457. In Whalen, the&para;<br>Court upheld a New York law permitting the collection of names and&para;<br>addresses of persons prescribed dangerous drugs, finding that the&para;<br>statute’s “security provisions,” which protected against “public disclo&para;<br>sure” of patient information, 462 U. S., at 600–601, were sufficient to&para;<br>protect a privacy interest “arguably . . . root[ed] in the Constitution,”&para;<br>id., at 605. In Nixon, the Court upheld a law requiring the former&para;<br>President to turn over his presidential papers and tape recordings for&para;<br>archival review and screening, concluding that the federal Act at is&para;<br>sue, like the statute in Whalen, had protections against “undue dis&para;<br>semination of private materials.” 433 U. S, at 458. Since Nixon, the&para;<br>Court has said little else on the subject of a constitutional right to in&para;<br>formational privacy. Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>2. Assuming, without deciding, that the Government’s challenged&para;<br>inquiries implicate a privacy interest of constitutional significance,&para;<br>that interest, whatever its scope, does not prevent the Government&para;<br>from asking reasonable questions of the sort included on SF–85 and&para;<br>Form 42 in an employment background investigation that is subject&para;<br>to the Privacy Act’s safeguards against public disclosure. Pp. 10–24.&para;<br>(a) The forms are reasonable in light of the Government interests&para;<br>at stake. Pp. 11–19.&para;<br>(1) Judicial review of the forms must take into account the con&para;<br>text in which the Government’s challenged inquiries arise. When the&para;<br>Government acts in its capacity “as proprietor” and manager of its&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>“internal operation,” Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367&para;<br>U. S. 886, 896, it has a much freer hand than when it regulates as to&para;<br>citizens generally. The questions respondents challenge are part of a&para;<br>standard background check of the sort used by millions of private&para;<br>employers. The Government has been conducting employment inves&para;<br>tigations since the Republic’s earliest days, and the President has&para;<br>had statutory authority to assess an applicant’s fitness for the civil&para;<br>service since 1871. Standard background investigations similar to&para;<br>those at issue became mandatory for federal civil-service candidates&para;<br>in 1953, and the investigations challenged here arose from a decision&para;<br>to extend that requirement to federal contract employees. This his&para;<br>tory shows that the Government has an interest in conducting basic&para;<br>background checks in order to ensure the security of its facilities and&para;<br>to employ a competent, reliable workforce to carry out the people’s&para;<br>business. The interest is not diminished by the fact that respondents&para;<br>are contract employees. There are no meaningful distinctions in the&para;<br>duties of NASA’s civil-service and contractor employees, especially at&para;<br>JPL, where contract employees do work that is critical to NASA’s&para;<br>mission and that is funded with a multibillion dollar taxpayer in&para;<br>vestment. Pp. 12–15.&para;<br>(2) The challenged questions on SF–85 and Form 42 are rea&para;<br>sonable, employment-related inquiries that further the Government’s&para;<br>interests in managing its internal operations. SF–85’s “treatment or&para;<br>counseling” question is a followup question to a reasonable inquiry&para;<br>about illegal-drug use. In context, the drug-treatment inquiry is also&para;<br>a reasonable, employment-related inquiry. The Government, recog&para;<br>nizing that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and medical issue,&para;<br>seeks to separate out those drug users who are taking steps to ad&para;<br>dress and overcome their problems. Thus, it uses responses to the&para;<br>drug-treatment question as a mitigating factor in its contractor cre&para;<br>dentialing decisions. The Court rejects the argument that the Gov&para;<br>ernment has a constitutional burden to demonstrate that its em&para;<br>ployment background questions are “necessary” or the least&para;<br>restrictive means of furthering its interests. So exacting a standard&para;<br>runs directly contrary to Whalen. See 429 U. S., at 596–597. Pp. 16–&para;<br>18.&para;<br>(3) Like SF–85’s drug-treatment question, Form 42’s open&para;<br>ended questions are reasonably aimed at identifying capable employ&para;<br>ees who will faithfully conduct the Government’s business. Asking&para;<br>an applicant’s designated references broad questions about job suit&para;<br>ability is an appropriate tool for separating strong candidates from&para;<br>weak ones. The reasonableness of such questions is illustrated by&para;<br>their pervasiveness in the public and private sectors. Pp. 18–19.&para;<br>(b) In addition to being reasonable in light of the Government in&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>NASA v. NELSON&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>terests at stake, SF–85 and Form 42 are also subject to substantial&para;<br>protections against disclosure to the public. Whalen and Nixon rec&para;<br>ognized that a “statutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted&para;<br>disclosures” generally allays privacy concerns created by government&para;<br>“accumulation” of “personal information” for “public purposes.”&para;<br>Whalen, supra, at 605. Respondents attack only the Government’s&para;<br>collection of information, and here, as in Whalen and Nixon, the in&para;<br>formation collected is shielded by statute from unwarranted disclo&para;<br>sure. The Privacy Act—which allows the Government to maintain&para;<br>only those records “relevant and necessary to accomplish” a purpose&para;<br>authorized by law, 5 U. S. C. §552a(e)(1); requires written consent be&para;<br>fore the Government may disclose an individual’s records, §552a(b);&para;<br>and imposes criminal liability for willful violations of its nondisclo&para;<br>sure obligations, §552a(i)(1)—“evidence[s] a proper concern” for indi&para;<br>vidual privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at 458–459.&para;<br>Respondents’ claim that the statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act’s&para;<br>disclosure bar, see §§552a(b)(1)–(12), leave its protections too porous&para;<br>to supply a meaningful check against unwarranted disclosures. But&para;<br>that argument rests on an incorrect reading of Whalen, Nixon, and&para;<br>the Privacy Act. Pp. 19–23.&para;<br>&para;<br>530 F. 3d 865, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

Roe,&para;<br>429 U. S. 589, 599–600 (1977); Nixon v. Administrator of&para;<br>General Services, 433 U. S. 425, 457 (1977). Respondents&para;<br>in this case, federal contract employees at a Government&para;<br>laboratory, claim that two parts of a standard employment&para;<br>background investigation violate their rights under&para;<br>Whalen and Nixon. Respondents challenge a section of a&para;<br>form questionnaire that asks employees about treatment&para;<br>or counseling for recent illegal-drug use. They also object&para;<br>to certain open-ended questions on a form sent to employ&para;<br>ees’ designated references.&para;<br>We assume, without deciding, that the Constitution&para;<br>protects a privacy right of the sort mentioned in Whalen&para;<br>and Nixon. We hold, however, that the challenged por&para;<br>tions of the Government’s background check do not violate&para;<br>this right in the present case.

L. 111–314, §3, 124 Stat. 3333, 51 U. S. C.&para;<br>§20112(a)(1). NASA’s workforce numbers in the tens of&para;<br>thousands of employees. While many of these workers are&para;<br>federal civil servants, a substantial majority are employed&para;<br>directly by Government contractors. Contract employees&para;<br>play an important role in NASA’s mission, and their du&para;<br>ties are functionally equivalent to those performed by civil&para;<br>servants.&para;<br>One NASA facility, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)&para;<br>in Pasadena, California, is staffed exclusively by contract&para;<br>employees. NASA owns JPL, but the California Institute&para;<br>of Technology (Cal Tech) operates the facility under a&para;<br>Government contract. JPL is the lead NASA center for&para;<br>deep-space robotics and communications.

App. 82 (Complaint for Injunctive and Declara&para;<br>tory Relief).4 The District Court denied respondents’&para;<br>motion for a preliminary injunction, but the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>granted an injunction pending appeal, 506 F. 3d 713&para;<br>(2007), and later reversed the District Court’s order. The&para;<br>court held that portions of both SF–85 and Form 42 are&para;<br>likely unconstitutional and should be preliminarily en&para;<br>joined. 512 F. 3d 1134, vacated and superseded, 530 F. 3d&para;<br>865 (2008).&para;<br>Turning first to SF–85, the Court of Appeals noted&para;<br>respondents’ concession “that most of the questions” on the&para;<br>form are “unproblematic” and do not “implicate the consti&para;<br>tutional right to informational privacy.” 530 F. 3d, at 878.&para;<br>But the court determined that the “group of questions&para;<br>concerning illegal drugs” required closer scrutiny.

Respondents relied on a document, which had&para;<br>been temporarily posted on the JPL intranet, that listed factors pur&para;<br>portedly bearing on suitability for federal employment. App. 98–104.&para;<br>Among the listed factors were a failure to “mee[t] financial obligations,”&para;<br>“health issues,” and “mental, emotional, psychological, or psychiatric&para;<br>issues.” Id., at 98, 102. Other factors, which were listed under the&para;<br>heading “Criminal or Immoral Conduct,” included “indecent exposure,”&para;<br>“voyeurism,” “indecent proposal[s],” and “carnal knowledge.” Id., at 98.&para;<br>The document also stated that while “homosexuality,” “adultery,” and&para;<br>“illegitimate children” were not “suitability” issues in and of them&para;<br>selves, they might pose “security issue[s]” if circumstances indicated a&para;<br>“susceptibility to coercion or blackmail.” Id., at 102. The Court of&para;<br>Appeals rejected respondents’ “challenges to . . . suitability determina&para;<br>tion[s]” as unripe. 530 F. 3d, at 873. Although respondents did not file&para;<br>a cross-petition from that portion of the Ninth Circuit’s judgment, they&para;<br>nonetheless discuss these suitability criteria at some length in their&para;<br>brief before this Court.

In discussing&para;<br>that claim, the Court said that “[t]he cases sometimes&para;<br>characterized as protecting ‘privacy’ ” actually involved “at&para;<br>least two different kinds of interests”: one, an “interest in&para;<br>avoiding disclosure of personal matters”;6 the other, an&para;<br>interest in “making certain kinds of important decisions”&para;<br>free from government interference.7 The patients who&para;<br>brought suit in Whalen argued that New York’s statute&para;<br>“threaten[ed] to impair” both their “nondisclosure” inter&para;<br>ests and their interests in making healthcare decisions&para;<br>independently. Id., at 600. The Court, however, upheld&para;<br>the statute as a “reasonable exercise of New York’s broad&para;<br>police powers.” Id., at 598.&para;<br>Whalen acknowledged that the disclosure of “private&para;<br>information” to the State was an “unpleasant invasion of&para;<br>privacy,” id., at 602, but the Court pointed out that the&para;<br>New York statute contained “security provisions” that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 429 U.

This sort of “statutory or regulatory&para;<br>duty to avoid unwarranted disclosures” of “accumulated&para;<br>private data” was sufficient, in the Court’s view, to protect&para;<br>a privacy interest that “arguably ha[d] its roots in the&para;<br>Constitution.” Id., at 605–606. The Court thus concluded&para;<br>that the statute did not violate “any right or liberty pro&para;<br>tected by the Fourteenth Amendment.” Id., at 606.&para;<br>Four months later, the Court referred again to a consti&para;<br>tutional “interest in avoiding disclosure.” Nixon, 433&para;<br>U.

S., at 458. Indeed, the&para;<br>Court observed that the former President’s claim was&para;<br>“weaker” than the one “found wanting . . . in Whalen,” as&para;<br>the Government was required to return immediately all&para;<br>“purely private papers and recordings” identified by the&para;<br>archivists. Id., at 458–459.

Many courts hold&para;<br>that disclosure of at least some kinds of personal information should be&para;<br>subject to a test that balances the government’s interests against the&para;<br>individual’s interest in avoiding disclosure. E.g., Barry v. New York,&para;<br>712 F. 2d 1554, 1559 (CA2 1983); Fraternal Order of Police v. Philadel&para;<br>phia, 812 F. 2d 105, 110 (CA3 1987); Woodland v.

See Engquist, 553 U. S., at 598–599; Whalen, 429&para;<br>U. S., at 597–598. As to SF–85, the only part of the form&para;<br>challenged here is its request for information about “any&para;<br>treatment or counseling received” for illegal-drug use&para;<br>within the previous year. The “treatment or counseling”&para;<br>question, however, must be considered in context. It is a&para;<br>followup to SF–85’s inquiry into whether the employee has&para;<br>“used, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs”&para;<br>during the past year. The Government has good reason to&para;<br>ask employees about their recent illegal-drug use. Like&para;<br>any employer, the Government is entitled to have its&para;<br>projects staffed by reliable, law-abiding persons who will&para;<br>“ ‘efficiently and effectively’ ” discharge their duties. See&para;<br>Engquist, supra, at 598–599. Questions about illegal-drug&para;<br>use are a useful way of figuring out which persons have&para;<br>these characteristics.

Re&para;<br>spondents’ argument is that, if drug treatment is only&para;<br>used to mitigate, then the Government should change the&para;<br>mandatory phrasing of SF–85—“Include [in your answer]&para;<br>any treatment or counseling received”—so as to make a&para;<br>response optional. App. 94. As it stands, the mandatory&para;<br>“treatment or counseling” question is unconstitutional, in&para;<br>respondents’ view, because it is “more intrusive than&para;<br>necessary to satisfy the government’s objective.” Brief for&para;<br>Respondents 26; 530 F. 3d, at 879 (holding that “treat&para;<br>ment or counseling” question should be enjoined because&para;<br>the form “appears to compel disclosure”).&para;<br>We reject the argument that the Government, when it&para;<br>requests job-related personal information in an employ&para;<br>ment background check, has a constitutional burden to&para;<br>demonstrate that its questions are “necessary” or the least&para;<br>restrictive means of furthering its interests. So exacting a&para;<br>standard runs directly contrary to Whalen.

The Court quickly rejected that argument,&para;<br>concluding that New York’s collection of patients’ prescrip&para;<br>tion information could “not be held unconstitutional sim&para;<br>ply because” a court viewed it as “unnecessary, in whole or&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 Asking about treatment or counseling could also help the Govern&para;<br>ment identify chronic drug abusers for whom, “despite counseling and&para;<br>rehabilitation programs, there is little chance for effective rehabilita&para;<br>tion.” 38 Fed. Reg. 33315 (1973). At oral argument, however, the&para;<br>Acting Solicitor General explained that NASA views treatment or&para;<br>counseling solely as a “mitigat[ing]” factor that ameliorates concerns&para;<br>about recent illegal drug use.

See Engquist, supra, at 598–599.&para;<br>SF–85’s “treatment or counseling” question reasonably&para;<br>seeks to identify a subset of acknowledged drug users who&para;<br>are attempting to overcome their problems. The Govern&para;<br>ment’s considered position is that phrasing the question in&para;<br>more permissive terms would result in a lower response&para;<br>rate, and the question’s effectiveness in identifying illegal&para;<br>drug users who are suitable for employment would be&para;<br>“materially reduced.” Reply Brief for Petitioners 19. That&para;<br>is a reasonable position, falling within the “ ‘wide lati&para;<br>tude’ ” granted the Government in its dealings with em&para;<br>ployees. See Engquist, supra, at 600.&para;<br>3&para;<br>The Court of Appeals also held that the broad, “open&para;<br>ended questions” on Form 42 likely violate respondents’&para;<br>informational-privacy rights. Form 42 asks applicants’&para;<br>designated references and landlords for “information”&para;<br>bearing on “suitability for government employment or a&para;<br>security clearance.” App. 97. In a series of questions, the&para;<br>Government asks if the reference has any “adverse infor&para;<br>mation” about the applicant’s “honesty or trustworthi&para;<br>ness,” “violations of the law,” “financial integrity,” “abuse&para;<br>of alcohol and/or drugs,” “mental or emotional stability,”&para;<br>“general behavior or conduct,” or “other matters.” Ibid.&para;<br>These open-ended inquiries, like the drug-treatment&para;<br>question on SF–85, are reasonably aimed at identifying&para;<br>capable employees who will faithfully conduct the Gov&para;<br>ernment’s business. See Engquist, supra, at 598–599.&para;<br>Asking an applicant’s designated references broad, open&para;<br>ended questions about job suitability is an appropriate tool&para;<br>for separating strong candidates from weak ones.

Form 42 alone is sent out by the Government over&para;<br>1.8 million times annually. Ibid. In addition, the use of&para;<br>open-ended questions in employment background checks&para;<br>appears to be equally commonplace in the private sector.&para;<br>See, e.g., S.

The use of similar open-ended questions by&para;<br>the Government is reasonable and furthers its interests in&para;<br>managing its operations.&para;<br>B&para;<br>1&para;<br>Not only are SF–85 and Form 42 reasonable in light of&para;<br>the Government interests at stake, they are also subject to&para;<br>substantial protections against disclosure to the public.&para;<br>Both Whalen and Nixon recognized that government&para;<br>“accumulation” of “personal information” for “public pur&para;<br>poses” may pose a threat to privacy. Whalen, 429 U. S., at&para;<br>605; see Nixon 433 U. S., at 457–458, 462. But both deci&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>NASA v. NELSON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sions also stated that a “statutory or regulatory duty to&para;<br>avoid unwarranted disclosures” generally allays these&para;<br>privacy concerns. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at&para;<br>458–459. The Court in Whalen, relying on New York’s&para;<br>“security provisions” prohibiting public disclosure, turned&para;<br>aside a challenge to the collection of patients’ prescription&para;<br>information. 429 U. S., at 594, and n. 12, 600–601, 605.&para;<br>In Nixon, the Court rejected what it regarded as an even&para;<br>“weaker” claim by the former President because the Presi&para;<br>dential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act “[n]ot&para;<br>only . . . mandate[d] regulations” against “undue dissemi&para;<br>nation,” but also required immediate return of any “purely&para;<br>private” materials flagged by the Government’s archivists.&para;<br>433 U. S., at 458–459.&para;<br>Respondents in this case, like the patients in Whalen&para;<br>and former President Nixon, attack only the Government’s&para;<br>collection of information on SF–85 and Form 42. And&para;<br>here, no less than in Whalen and Nixon, the information&para;<br>collected is shielded by statute from “unwarranted disclo&para;<br>sur[e].” See Whalen, supra, at 605. The Privacy Act,&para;<br>which covers all information collected during the back&para;<br>ground-check process, allows the Government to maintain&para;<br>records “about an individual” only to the extent the re&para;<br>cords are “relevant and necessary to accomplish” a pur&para;<br>pose authorized by law. 5 U. S. C. §552a(e)(1). The Act&para;<br>requires written consent before the Government may&para;<br>disclose records pertaining to any individual. §552a(b).&para;<br>And the Act imposes criminal liability for willful violations&para;<br>of its nondisclosure obligations. §552a(i)(1). These re&para;<br>quirements, as we have noted, give “forceful recognition”&para;<br>to a Government employee’s interest in maintaining the&para;<br>“confidentiality of sensitive information . . . in his person&para;<br>nel files.” Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB, 440 U. S. 301, 318,&para;<br>n. 16 (1979). Like the protections against disclosure in&para;<br>Whalen and Nixon, they “evidence a proper concern” for&para;<br>individual privacy. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>at 458–459.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Notwithstanding these safeguards, respondents argue&para;<br>that statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act’s disclosure&para;<br>bar, see §§552a(b)(1)–(12), leave its protections too porous&para;<br>to supply a meaningful check against “unwarranted dis&para;<br>closures,” Whalen, supra, at 605. Respondents point in&para;<br>particular to what they describe as a “broad” exception&para;<br>for “routine use[s],” defined as uses that are “compatible&para;<br>with the purpose for which the record was collected.”&para;<br>§§552a(b)(3), (a)(7).&para;<br>Respondents’ reliance on these exceptions rests on an&para;<br>incorrect reading of both our precedents and the terms of&para;<br>the Privacy Act. As to our cases, the Court in Whalen and&para;<br>Nixon referred approvingly to statutory or regulatory&para;<br>protections against “unwarranted disclosures” and “undue&para;<br>dissemination” of personal information collected by the&para;<br>Government. Whalen, supra, at 605; Nixon, supra, at 458.&para;<br>Neither case suggested that an ironclad disclosure bar is&para;<br>needed to satisfy privacy interests that may be “root[ed] in&para;<br>the Constitution.” Whalen, supra, at 605. In Whalen, the&para;<br>New York statute prohibiting “[p]ublic disclosure of the&para;<br>identity of patients” was itself subject to several excep&para;<br>tions. 429 U. S., at 594–595, and n. 12. In Nixon, the&para;<br>protections against “undue dissemination” mentioned in&para;<br>the opinion were not even before the Court, but were to be&para;<br>included in forthcoming regulations “mandate[d]” by the&para;<br>challenged Act. 433 U. S., at 458; see id., at 437–439&para;<br>(explaining that the Court was limiting its review to the&para;<br>Act’s “facial validity” and was not considering the Admin&para;<br>istrator’s forthcoming regulations). Thus, the mere fact&para;<br>that the Privacy Act’s nondisclosure requirement is sub&para;<br>ject to exceptions does not show that the statute provides&para;<br>insufficient protection against public disclosure.&para;<br>Nor does the substance of the “routine use” exception&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>NASA v. NELSON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>relied on by respondents create any undue risk of public&para;<br>dissemination. None of the authorized “routine use[s]” of&para;<br>respondents’ background-check information allows for&para;<br>release to the public. 71 Fed. Reg. 45859–45860, 45862&para;<br>(2006); 60 Fed. Reg. 63084 (1995), as amended, 75 Fed.&para;<br>Reg. 28307 (2010).&para;<br>Rather, the established “routine&para;<br>use[s]” consist of limited, reasonable steps designed to&para;<br>complete the background-check process in an efficient and&para;<br>orderly manner. See Whalen, supra, at 602 (approving&para;<br>disclosures to authorized New York Department of Health&para;<br>employees that were not “meaningfully distinguishable”&para;<br>from routine disclosures “associated with many facets of&para;<br>health care”). One routine use, for example, involves a&para;<br>limited disclosure to persons filling out Form 42 so that&para;<br>designated references can “identify the individual” at issue&para;<br>and can understand the “nature and purpose of the inves&para;<br>tigation.” App. 89. Authorized JPL employees also review&para;<br>each completed SF–85 to verify that all requested infor&para;<br>mation has been provided. Id., at 211. These designated&para;<br>JPL employees may not “disclose any information con&para;<br>tained in the form to anyone else,” ibid., and Cal Tech is&para;<br>not given access to adverse information uncovered during&para;<br>the Government’s background check, id., at 207–208. The&para;<br>“remote possibility” of public disclosure created by these&para;<br>narrow “routine use[s]” does not undermine the Privacy&para;<br>Act’s substantial protections. See Whalen, 429 U. S., at&para;<br>601–602 (“remote possibility” that statutory security&para;<br>provisions will “provide inadequate protection against&para;<br>unwarranted disclosures” not a sufficient basis for striking&para;<br>down statute).&para;<br>Citing past violations of the Privacy Act,14 respondents&para;<br>——————&para;<br>14 E.g.,&para;<br>&para;<br>GAO, Personal Information: Data Breaches are Frequent, but&para;<br>Evidence of Resulting Identity Theft is Limited; However, the Full&para;<br>Extent Is Unknown 5, 20 (GAO 07–737, 2007) (over 3-year period, 788&para;<br>data breaches occurred at 17 federal agencies).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

But data&para;<br>breaches are a possibility any time the Government stores&para;<br>information. As the Court recognized in Whalen, the mere&para;<br>possibility that security measures will fail provides no&para;<br>“proper ground” for a broad-based attack on government&para;<br>information-collection practices. Ibid. Respondents also&para;<br>cite a portion of SF–85 that warns of possible disclosure&para;<br>“[t]o the news media or the general public.” App. 89. By&para;<br>its terms, this exception allows public disclosure only&para;<br>where release is “in the public interest” and would not&para;<br>result in “an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”&para;<br>Ibid. Respondents have not cited any example of such a&para;<br>disclosure, nor have they identified any plausible scenario&para;<br>in which their information might be unduly disclosed&para;<br>under this exception.15&para;<br>In light of the protection provided by the Privacy Act’s&para;<br>nondisclosure requirement, and because the challenged&para;<br>portions of the forms consist of reasonable inquiries in an&para;<br>employment background check, we conclude that the&para;<br>Government’s inquiries do not violate a constitutional&para;<br>right to informational privacy.

But rather than reach this con&para;<br>clusion on the basis of the never-explained assumption&para;<br>that the Constitution requires courts to “balance” the&para;<br>Government’s interests in data collection against its con&para;<br>tractor employees’ interest in privacy, I reach it on simpler&para;<br>grounds. Like many other desirable things not included&para;<br>in the Constitution, “informational privacy” seems like a&para;<br>good idea—wherefore the People have enacted laws at the&para;<br>federal level and in the states restricting the government’s&para;<br>collection and use of information. But it is up to the Peo&para;<br>ple to enact those laws, to shape them, and, when they&para;<br>think it appropriate, to repeal them. A federal constitu&para;<br>tional right to “informational privacy” does not exist.&para;<br>Before addressing the constitutional issues, however, I&para;<br>must observe a remarkable and telling fact about this&para;<br>case, unique in my tenure on this Court: Respondents’&para;<br>brief, in arguing that the Federal Government violated the&para;<br>Constitution, does not once identify which provision of&para;<br>the Constitution that might be. The Table of Authorities&para;<br>contains citations of cases from federal and state courts,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NASA v. NELSON&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>federal and state statutes, Rules of Evidence from four&para;<br>states, two Executive Orders, a House Report, and even&para;<br>more exotic sources of law, such as two reports of the&para;<br>Government Accountability Office and an EEOC document&para;<br>concerning “Enforcement Guidance.” And yet it contains&para;<br>not a single citation of the sole document we are called&para;<br>upon to construe: the Constitution of the United States.&para;<br>The body of the brief includes a single, fleeting reference&para;<br>to the Due Process Clause, buried in a citation of the&para;<br>assuredly inapposite Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558&para;<br>(2003), Brief for Respondents 42; but no further attempt is&para;<br>made to argue that NASA’s actions deprived respondents&para;<br>of liberty without due process of law. And this legal strat&para;<br>egy was not limited to respondents’ filing in this Court; in&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit respondents asserted in a footnote that&para;<br>“courts have grounded the right to informational privacy&para;<br>in various provisions of the Constitution,” Brief for Appel&para;<br>lants in No. 07–56424, p. 25, n. 18, but declined to identify&para;<br>which ones applied here.&para;<br>To tell the truth, I found this approach refreshingly&para;<br>honest. One who asks us to invent a constitutional right&para;<br>out of whole cloth should spare himself and us the pre&para;<br>tense of tying it to some words of the Constitution. Re&para;<br>grettably, this Lincolnesque honesty evaporated at oral&para;<br>argument, when counsel asserted, apparently for the first&para;<br>time in this litigation, that the right to informational&para;<br>privacy emerged from the Due Process Clause of the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28–29. That counsel in&para;<br>voked the infinitely plastic concept of “substantive” due&para;<br>process does not make this constitutional theory any less&para;<br>invented.&para;<br>This case is easily resolved on the simple ground that&para;<br>the Due Process Clause does not “guarante[e] certain&para;<br>(unspecified) liberties”; rather, it “merely guarantees&para;<br>certain procedures as a prerequisite to deprivation of&para;<br>liberty.” Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 275 (1994)&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., concurring). Respondents make no claim that&para;<br>the State has deprived them of liberty without the requi&para;<br>site procedures, and their due process claim therefore&para;<br>must fail. Even under the formula we have adopted for&para;<br>identifying liberties entitled to protection under the faux&para;<br>“substantive” component of the Due Process Clause—that&para;<br>“the Due Process Clause specially protects those funda&para;<br>mental rights and liberties which are, objectively, deeply&para;<br>rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” Washington&para;<br>v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720–721 (1997) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted)—respondents’ claim would fail.&para;<br>Respondents do not even attempt to argue that the claim&para;<br>at issue in this case passes that test, perhaps recognizing&para;<br>the farcical nature of a contention that a right deeply&para;<br>rooted in our history and tradition bars the Government&para;<br>from ensuring that the Hubble Telescope is not used by&para;<br>recovering drug addicts.&para;<br>The absurdity of respondents’ position in this case&para;<br>should not, however, obscure the broader point: Our due&para;<br>process precedents, even our “substantive due process”&para;<br>precedents, do not support any right to informational&para;<br>privacy. First, we have held that the government’s act of&para;<br>defamation does not deprive a person “of any ‘liberty’&para;<br>protected by the procedural guarantees of the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment.” Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693, 709 (1976).&para;<br>We reasoned that stigma, standing alone, does not “sig&para;<br>nificantly alte[r]” a person’s legal status so as to “justif[y]&para;<br>the invocation of procedural safeguards.” Id., at 708–709.&para;<br>If outright defamation does not qualify, it is unimaginable&para;<br>that the mere disclosure of private information does.&para;<br>Second, respondents challenge the Government’s collec&para;<br>tion of their private information. But the Government’s&para;<br>collection of private information is regulated by the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment, and “[w]here a particular Amendment pro&para;<br>vides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection&para;<br>against a particular sort of government behavior, that&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>NASA v. NELSON&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>Amendment, not the more generalized notion of substan&para;<br>tive due process, must be the guide for analyzing these&para;<br>claims.” County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U. S. 833,&para;<br>842 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration&para;<br>in original). Here, the Ninth Circuit rejected respondents’&para;<br>Fourth Amendment argument, correctly holding that the&para;<br>Form 42 inquiries to third parties were not Fourth&para;<br>Amendment “searches” under United States v. Miller, 425&para;<br>U. S. 435 (1976), and that the Fourth Amendment does&para;<br>not prohibit the Government from asking questions about&para;<br>private information. 530 F. 3d 865, 876–877 (2008). That&para;<br>should have been the end of the matter. Courts should not&para;<br>use the Due Process Clause as putty to fill up gaps they&para;<br>deem unsightly in the protections provided by other con&para;<br>stitutional provisions.&para;<br>In sum, I would simply hold that there is no constitu&para;<br>tional right to “informational privacy.” Besides being&para;<br>consistent with constitutional text and tradition, this view&para;<br>has the attractive benefit of resolving this case without&para;<br>resort to the Court’s exegesis on the Government’s legiti&para;<br>mate interest in identifying contractor drug abusers and&para;<br>the comfortingly narrow scope of NASA’s “routine use”&para;<br>regulations. I shall not fill the U. S. Reports with further&para;<br>explanation of the incoherence of the Court’s “substantive&para;<br>due process” doctrine in its many manifestations, since the&para;<br>Court does not play the substantive-due-process card.&para;<br>Instead, it states that it will “assume, without deciding”&para;<br>that there exists a right to informational privacy, ante,&para;<br>at 1.&para;<br>The Court’s sole justification for its decision to “assume,&para;<br>without deciding” is that the Court made the same mis&para;<br>take before—in two 33-year-old cases, Whalen v.

S. 479 (1965), concerning the “penum&para;<br>bra” of the First Amendment; and three concurring or&para;<br>dissenting opinions, none of which remotely intimated&para;<br>that there might be such a thing as a substantive due&para;<br>process right to informational privacy. 429 U. S., at 599,&para;<br>n. 25. Nixon provided even less support. After citing the&para;<br>observation in Whalen that “[o]ne element of privacy has&para;<br>been characterized as the individual interest in avoiding&para;<br>disclosure of personal matters,” Nixon, supra, at 457&para;<br>(quoting Whalen, supra, at 599; internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted), it proceeded to conduct a straightforward Fourth&para;<br>Amendment analysis. It “assume[d]” that there was a&para;<br>“legitimate expectation of privacy” in the materials, and&para;<br>rejected the appellant’s argument that the statute at issue&para;<br>was “precisely the kind of abuse that the Fourth Amend&para;<br>ment was intended to prevent.” Nixon, supra, at 457–458,&para;<br>460. It is unfathomable why these cases’ passing, barely&para;<br>explained reference to a right separate from the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment—an unenumerated right that they held to be&para;<br>not applicable—should be afforded stare decisis weight.&para;<br>At this point the reader may be wondering: “What, after&para;<br>all, is the harm in being ‘minimalist’ and simply refusing&para;<br>to say that violation of a constitutional right of informa&para;<br>tional privacy can never exist? The outcome in this case is&para;<br>the same, so long as the Court holds that any such hypo&para;<br>thetical right was not violated.” Well, there is harm. The&para;<br>Court’s never-say-never disposition does damage for sev&para;<br>eral reasons.&para;<br>1. It is in an important sense not actually minimalist.&para;<br>By substituting for one real constitutional question&para;<br>(whether there exists a constitutional right to informa&para;<br>tional privacy) a different constitutional question (whether&para;<br>NASA’s background checks would contravene a right to&para;<br>informational privacy if such a right existed), the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>gets to pontificate upon a matter that is none of its&para;<br>business: the appropriate balance between security and&para;<br>privacy. If I am correct that there exists no right to in&para;<br>formational privacy, all that discussion is an exercise in&para;<br>judicial maximalism. Better simply to state and apply&para;<br>the law forthrightly than to hold our view of the law in&para;<br>pectore, so that we can inquire into matters beyond our&para;<br>charter, and probably beyond our ken.&para;<br>If, on the other hand, the Court believes that there is a&para;<br>constitutional right to informational privacy, then I fail to&para;<br>see the minimalist virtues in delivering a lengthy opinion&para;<br>analyzing that right while coyly noting that the right is&para;<br>“assumed” rather than “decided.” Thirty-three years have&para;<br>passed since the Court first suggested that the right may,&para;<br>or may not, exist. It is past time for the Court to abandon&para;<br>this Alfred Hitchcock line of our jurisprudence.&para;<br>2. It harms our image, if not our self-respect, because it&para;<br>makes no sense. The Court decides that the Government&para;<br>did not violate the right to informational privacy without&para;<br>deciding whether there is a right to informational privacy,&para;<br>and without even describing what hypothetical standard&para;<br>should be used to assess whether the hypothetical right&para;<br>has been violated. As I explained last Term in objecting to&para;<br>another of the Court’s never-say-never dispositions:&para;<br>“[The Court] cannot decide that [respondents’] claim&para;<br>fails without first deciding what a valid claim would&para;<br>consist of. . . . [A]greeing to or crafting a hypothetical&para;<br>standard for a hypothetical constitutional right is suf&para;<br>ficiently unappealing . . . that [the Court] might as&para;<br>well acknowledge the right as well. Or [it] could avoid&para;<br>the need to agree with or craft a hypothetical stan&para;<br>dard by denying the right. But embracing a standard&para;<br>while being coy about the right is, well, odd; and de&para;<br>ciding this case while addressing neither the standard&para;<br>nor the right is quite impossible.” Stop the Beach Re&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>NASA v. NELSON&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>nourishment, Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Environmental&para;<br>Protection, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (plurality opinion)&para;<br>(joined by ALITO, J.) (slip op., at 12–13).&para;<br>Whatever the virtues of judicial minimalism, it cannot&para;<br>justify judicial incoherence.&para;<br>The Court defends its approach by observing that&para;<br>“we have only the ‘scarce and open-ended’ ” guideposts of&para;<br>substantive due process to show us the way.” Ante, at 11,&para;<br>n. 10. I would have thought that this doctrinal obscurity&para;<br>should lead us to provide more clarity for lower courts;&para;<br>surely one vague opinion should not provide an excuse for&para;<br>another.&para;<br>The Court observes that I have joined other opinions&para;<br>that have assumed the existence of constitutional rights.&para;<br>Ibid. It is of course acceptable to reserve difficult constitu&para;<br>tional questions, so long as answering those questions is&para;<br>unnecessary to coherent resolution of the issue presented&para;<br>in the case. So in Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health,&para;<br>497 U. S. 261, 279–280 (1990), we declined to decide&para;<br>whether a competent person had a constitutional right to&para;<br>refuse lifesaving hydration, because—under a constitu&para;<br>tional standard we laid out in detail—such a right did not&para;<br>exist for an incompetent person. In Herrera v. Collins, 506&para;<br>U. S. 390, 417–418 (1993), we declined to decide whether&para;<br>it would be unconstitutional to execute an innocent per&para;<br>son, because Herrera had not shown that he was innocent.&para;<br>In New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York,&para;<br>487 U. S. 1, 10–15 (1988), we declined to decide whether&para;<br>there was a constitutional right of private association for&para;<br>certain clubs, because the plaintiff had brought a facial&para;<br>challenge, which would fail if the statute was valid in&para;<br>many of its applications, making it unnecessary to decide&para;<br>whether an as-applied challenge as to some clubs could&para;<br>succeed. Here, however, the Court actually applies a&para;<br>constitutional informational privacy standard without&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>giving a clue as to the rule of law it is applying.&para;<br>3. It provides no guidance whatsoever for lower courts.&para;<br>Consider the sheer multiplicity of unweighted, relevant&para;<br>factors alluded to in today’s opinion:&para;<br>•	 It is relevant that the Government is acting “in its&para;<br>capacity ‘as proprietor’ and manager of its ‘internal op&para;<br>eration.’ ” Ante, at 12. Of course, given that we are&para;<br>told neither what the appropriate standard should be&para;<br>when the Government is acting as regulator nor what&para;<br>the appropriate standard should be when it is acting as&para;<br>proprietor, it is not clear what effect this fact has on&para;<br>the analysis; but at least we know that it is something.&para;<br>•	 History and tradition have some role to play, ante, at&para;<br>13–14, but how much is uncertain. The Court points&para;<br>out that the Federal Government has been conducting&para;<br>investigations of candidates for employment since the&para;<br>earliest days; but on the other hand it acknowledges&para;<br>that extension of those investigations to employees of&para;<br>contractors is of very recent vintage.&para;<br>•	 The contract employees are doing important work.&para;<br>They are not mere janitors and maintenance men; they&para;<br>are working on a $568 million observatory. Ante, at&para;<br>15. Can it possibly be that the outcome of today’s case&para;<br>would be different for background checks of lower-level&para;<br>employees? In the spirit of minimalism we are never&para;<br>told.&para;<br>•	 Questions about drug treatment are (hypothetically)&para;<br>constitutional because they are “reasonable,” “useful,”&para;<br>and “humane.” Ante, at 16–17 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). And questions to third parties are&para;<br>constitutional because they are “appropriate” and “per&para;<br>vasiv[e].” Ante, at 18–19. Any or all of these adjectives&para;<br>may be the hypothetical standard by which violation of&para;<br>the hypothetical constitutional right to “informational&para;<br>privacy” is evaluated.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>NASA v. NELSON&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>•	 The Court notes that a “ ‘statutory or regulatory duty&para;<br>to avoid unwarranted disclosures’ generally allays&para;<br>these privacy concerns,” ante, at 20 (emphasis added),&para;<br>but it gives no indication of what the exceptions to this&para;<br>general rule might be. It then discusses the provisions&para;<br>of the Privacy Act in detail, placing considerable em&para;<br>phasis on the limitations imposed by NASA’s routine&para;<br>use regulations. Ante, at 21–23. From the length of&para;<br>the discussion, I would bet that the Privacy Act is nec&para;<br>essary to today’s holding, but how much of it is neces&para;<br>sary is a mystery.&para;<br>4. It will dramatically increase the number of lawsuits&para;<br>claiming violations of the right to informational privacy.&para;<br>Rare will be the claim that is supported by none of the&para;<br>factors deemed relevant in today’s opinion. Moreover, the&para;<br>utter silliness of respondents’ position in this case leaves&para;<br>plenty of room for the possible success of future claims&para;<br>that are meritless, but slightly less absurd. Respondents&para;<br>claim that even though they are Government contractor&para;<br>employees, and even though they are working with highly&para;<br>expensive scientific equipment, and even though the Gov&para;<br>ernment is seeking only information about drug treatment&para;<br>and information from third parties that is standard in&para;<br>background checks, and even though the Government is&para;<br>liable for damages if that information is ever revealed, and&para;<br>even though NASA’s Privacy Act regulations are very&para;<br>protective of private information, NASA’s background&para;<br>checks are unconstitutional. Ridiculous. In carefully&para;<br>citing all of these factors as the basis for its decision, the&para;<br>Court makes the distinguishing of this case simple as pie.&para;<br>In future cases filed under 42 U. S. C. §1983 in those&para;<br>circuits that recognize (rather than merely hypothesize) a&para;<br>constitutional right to “informational privacy,” lawyers&para;<br>will always (and I mean always) find some way around&para;<br>today’s opinion: perhaps the plaintiff will be a receptionist&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

And oh yes, the fact that a losing defendant&para;<br>will be liable not only for damages but also for attorney’s&para;<br>fees under §1988 will greatly encourage lawyers to sue,&para;<br>and defendants—for whom no safe harbor can be found in&para;<br>the many words of today’s opinion—to settle.
