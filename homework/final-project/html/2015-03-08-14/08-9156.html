ALLEN, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA &para;<br>&para;<br>DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–9156. Argued November 4, 2009—Decided January 20, 2010&para;<br>Under 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2), a federal court may grant a state pris&para;<br>oner habeas relief if his claim was adjudicated on the merits in state&para;<br>court and “resulted in a decision . . . based on an unreasonable de&para;<br>termination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State&para;<br>court proceeding.” Under §2254(e)(1), “a determination of a factual&para;<br>issue made by a State court [is] presumed to be correct,” and the peti&para;<br>tioner has “the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by&para;<br>clear and convincing evidence.”&para;<br>Petitioner Wood was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to&para;<br>death in Alabama state court. Two of his court-appointed attorneys,&para;<br>Dozier and Ralph, had significant trial experience, but the third,&para;<br>Trotter, had only recently been admitted to the bar. After exhausting&para;<br>his appeals, Wood sought postconviction relief under Alabama Rule of&para;<br>Criminal Procedure 32, arguing, among other things, that he was&para;<br>mentally retarded and not eligible for the death penalty, and that his&para;<br>trial counsel were ineffective because they failed to investigate and&para;<br>present evidence of his mental deficiencies during the trial’s penalty&para;<br>phase. The Rule 32 court conducted evidentiary hearings and denied&para;<br>the claims initially and on remand. As to the mental retardation&para;<br>claim, it found that Wood had not shown deficits in his adaptive func&para;<br>tioning. As to the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, it concluded&para;<br>that he had not established that his counsel’s performance was defi&para;<br>cient or that any deficiency prejudiced his defense. In so doing, it&para;<br>made a factual finding that counsel had made a strategic decision not&para;<br>to pursue evidence of Wood’s alleged retardation. Observing that&para;<br>counsel had asked Dr. Kirkland to conduct a mental evaluation, had&para;<br>thoroughly reviewed his report, and had determined that no further&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WOOD v. ALLEN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>investigation was warranted, the court additionally held that counsel&para;<br>appeared to have made a strategic decision not to present their lim&para;<br>ited mental-deficiency evidence to the jury because having Dr. Kirk&para;<br>land testify was not in Wood’s best interest. It also found no reason&para;<br>able probability of a different outcome had the evidence developed in&para;<br>the Rule 32 proceedings been presented at trial. Woods subsequently&para;<br>sought federal habeas relief under §2254. The District Court rejected&para;<br>all but his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. The District Court&para;<br>concluded that the state court’s finding that counsel made a strategic&para;<br>decision was an unreasonable determination of the facts. The court&para;<br>further held that counsel’s performance was deficient and had preju&para;<br>diced Wood, and that the state court’s contrary holdings were an un&para;<br>reasonable application of federal law under Strickland v. Washing&para;<br>ton, 466 U. S. 668. Reversing, the Eleventh Circuit held that the&para;<br>state court’s rejection of Wood’s ineffective-assistance claim was nei&para;<br>ther an unreasonable application of clearly established law nor based&para;<br>on an unreasonable determination of the facts. With respect to the&para;<br>facts, it concluded that the evidence in the Rule 32 hearings sup&para;<br>ported the state court’s strategic-decision finding, and it agreed with&para;<br>the state court’s legal conclusion that counsel’s strategic decision was&para;<br>reasonable and that Wood had failed to show prejudice. Wood’s cer&para;<br>tiorari petition raises the questions (1) whether, in order to obtain re&para;<br>lief under §2254(d)(2), a petitioner must establish only that the state&para;<br>court factual determination on which the decision was based was&para;<br>“unreasonable,” or whether §2254(e)(1) additionally requires a peti&para;<br>tioner to rebut a presumption that the determination was correct&para;<br>with clear and convincing evidence; and (2) whether the state court’s&para;<br>strategic-decision determination was reasonable.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Even under Wood’s reading of §2254(d)(2), the state court’s con&para;<br>clusion that his counsel made a strategic decision not to pursue or&para;<br>present evidence of his mental deficiencies was not an unreasonable&para;<br>determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the&para;<br>state-court proceedings. This Court need not reach the question&para;<br>whether §2254(e)(1) applies in every case presenting a challenge un&para;<br>der §2254(d)(2), see Rice v. Collins, 546 U. S. 333, 339, because its&para;<br>view of the state court’s factual determination here does not depend&para;<br>on an interpretative difference regarding the relationship between&para;<br>those provisions. While “[t]he term ‘unreasonable’ is . . . difficult to&para;<br>define,” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 410, it suffices to say that&para;<br>a state-court factual determination is not unreasonable merely be&para;<br>cause the federal habeas court would have reached a different conclu&para;<br>sion in the first instance. See Rice, supra, at 341–342. Here, the&para;<br>state-court record shows that all of Wood’s counsel read the Kirkland&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>report. Trotter testified that Dozier told him that nothing in the re&para;<br>port merited further investigation, a recollection supported by the at&para;<br>torneys’ contemporaneous letters; and Trotter told the sentencing&para;<br>judge that counsel did not intend to introduce the report to the jury.&para;<br>This evidence can fairly be read to support the Rule 32 court’s factual&para;<br>determination that counsel’s failure to pursue or present evidence of&para;<br>Wood’s mental deficiencies was not mere oversight or neglect but the&para;<br>result of a deliberate decision to focus on other defenses. Most of the&para;<br>contrary evidence Wood highlights—e.g., that Dozier and Ralph put&para;<br>the inexperienced Trotter in charge of the penalty phase proceed&para;<br>ings—speaks not to whether counsel made a strategic decision, but to&para;<br>whether counsel’s judgment was reasonable, a question not before&para;<br>this Court. Any evidence plausibly inconsistent with the strategic&para;<br>decision finding does not suffice to show that the finding was unrea&para;<br>sonable. Pp. 8–12.&para;<br>2. Because Wood’s argument that the state court unreasonably ap&para;<br>plied Strickland in rejecting his ineffective-assistance claim on the&para;<br>merits is not “fairly included” in the questions presented under this&para;<br>Court’s Rule 14.1(a), it will not be addressed here.

RICHARD F. ALLEN,&para;<br>&para;<br>COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>CORRECTIONS, ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[January 20, 2010] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of&para;<br>1996 contains two provisions governing federal-court&para;<br>review of state-court factual findings. Under 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254(d)(2), a federal court may not grant a state pris&para;<br>oner’s application for a writ of habeas corpus based on a&para;<br>claim already adjudicated on the merits in state court&para;<br>unless that adjudication “resulted in a decision that was&para;<br>based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in&para;<br>light of the evidence presented in the State court proceed&para;<br>ing.” Under §2254(e)(1), “a determination of a factual&para;<br>issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be cor&para;<br>rect,” and the petitioner “shall have the burden of rebut&para;<br>ting the presumption of correctness by clear and convinc&para;<br>ing evidence.” In this case, petitioner, a capital defendant,&para;<br>challenges the key factual finding made by the Alabama&para;<br>state court that denied his application for postconviction&para;<br>relief: that his attorneys’ failure to pursue and present&para;<br>mitigating evidence of his borderline mental retardation&para;<br>was a strategic decision rather than a negligent omission.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WOOD v. ALLEN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner argues that the state court’s finding was unrea&para;<br>sonable under §2254(d)(2) and that, in denying his federal&para;<br>habeas petition, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh&para;<br>Circuit erroneously conflated this standard with that of&para;<br>§2254(e)(1), which petitioner contends is not applicable in&para;<br>cases, such as this one, not involving a separate federal&para;<br>habeas evidentiary hearing.&para;<br>We granted certiorari to address the relationship be&para;<br>tween §§2254(d)(2) and (e)(1). We conclude, however, that&para;<br>the state court’s factual determination was reasonable&para;<br>even under petitioner’s reading of §2254(d)(2), and there&para;<br>fore we need not address that provision’s relationship to&para;<br>§2254(e)(1). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the&para;<br>Court of Appeals on that basis.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 1993, petitioner Holly Wood broke into the home of&para;<br>his ex-girlfriend and shot her in the head and face as she&para;<br>lay in her bed. The victim was pronounced dead on arrival&para;<br>at the hospital. Charged with capital murder during a&para;<br>first-degree burglary, Wood was represented at trial in&para;<br>Alabama state court by three court-appointed attorneys:&para;<br>Cary Dozier and Frank Ralph, both of whom had signifi&para;<br>cant trial experience, and Kenneth Trotter, who had been&para;<br>admitted to the bar for five months at the time he was&para;<br>appointed. The jury convicted Wood at the guilt phase of&para;<br>trial and recommended a death sentence at the penalty&para;<br>phase by a vote of 10 to 2. After a separate sentencing&para;<br>hearing, the trial judge imposed the death penalty. The&para;<br>Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Wood’s&para;<br>conviction and sentence, Ex parte Wood, 715 So. 2d 812&para;<br>(1996), as did the Alabama Supreme Court, Wood v. State,&para;<br>715 So. 2d 819 (1998). This Court denied certiorari. Wood&para;<br>v. Alabama, 525 U. S. 1042 (1998).&para;<br>Wood petitioned for state postconviction relief under&para;<br>Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 (2009), arguing,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>among other things, that he was mentally retarded and&para;<br>not eligible for the death penalty, and that his trial coun&para;<br>sel were ineffective under Strickland v. Washington, 466&para;<br>U. S. 668 (1984), because they failed to investigate and&para;<br>present evidence of his mental deficiencies during the&para;<br>penalty phase of trial. App. to Pet. for Cert. 198a–202a,&para;<br>207a–210a, 213a–216a, 220a–221a, 225a. The Rule 32&para;<br>court held two evidentiary hearings and denied Wood’s&para;<br>claims. On appeal, the Alabama Court of Criminal Ap&para;<br>peals remanded for further consideration in light of Atkins&para;<br>v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304 (2002), which held that the&para;<br>Eighth Amendment prohibits the execution of the men&para;<br>tally retarded. Wood v. State, 891 So. 2d 398 (2003).&para;<br>On remand, the Rule 32 court conducted a third eviden&para;<br>tiary hearing and once again denied relief. As to Wood’s&para;<br>claim of mental retardation, the court found that, while&para;<br>the evidence suggested that he “probably does exhibit&para;<br>significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning,”&para;<br>he had failed to show “that he has significant or substan&para;<br>tial deficits in his adaptive functioning.” App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 236a–237a.&para;<br>The court also rejected Wood’s factually related claim of&para;<br>ineffective assistance of counsel, concluding that Wood&para;<br>had failed to establish that his counsel’s performance was&para;<br>deficient or that any deficiency prejudiced his defense. Id.,&para;<br>at 257a–275a. The court first made a factual finding that&para;<br>Wood’s counsel had made a strategic decision not to pur&para;<br>sue evidence of his alleged mental retardation. The court&para;<br>observed that counsel had requested that a Dr. Karl Kirk&para;<br>land conduct a mental evaluation, had “thoroughly re&para;<br>viewed Dr. Kirkland’s report,” and had “determined that&para;<br>nothing in that report merited further investigation.” Id.,&para;<br>at 264a, 271a. The court additionally found that counsel&para;<br>appeared to have made a strategic decision not to present&para;<br>to the jury the limited evidence of Wood’s mental deficien&para;<br>cies in their possession, because “calling Dr. Kirkland to&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>WOOD v. ALLEN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>testify was not in Wood’s best interest.” Id., at 271a–272a.&para;<br>The court concluded that these strategic decisions were&para;<br>reasonable and thus that counsel had not performed defi&para;<br>ciently. Ibid. The court further concluded that there was&para;<br>“no reasonable probability” of a different outcome had the&para;<br>evidence developed in the Rule 32 hearings been presented&para;<br>to the jury or to the sentencing court. Id., at 273a. The&para;<br>Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, App. 589–&para;<br>610, and the Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari,&para;<br>id., at 4.&para;<br>Wood then filed a petition for federal habeas relief&para;<br>under §2254. The District Court rejected all of Wood’s&para;<br>claims save one: that counsel’s failure to investigate and&para;<br>present mitigation evidence of his mental deficiencies&para;<br>during the penalty phase constituted ineffective assistance&para;<br>of counsel. 465 F. Supp. 2d 1211, 1239–1245 (MD Ala.&para;<br>2006). According to the court, there was “nothing in the&para;<br>record to even remotely support a finding that counsel&para;<br>made a strategic decision not to let the jury at the penalty&para;<br>stage know about Wood’s mental condition.” Id., at 1242.&para;<br>Ralph and Dozier, the court noted, had placed the inexpe&para;<br>rienced Trotter in charge of the penalty phase. At the&para;<br>Rule 32 hearing, Trotter testified that he had seen the&para;<br>references to Wood’s intellectual functioning in the Kirk&para;<br>land report but did not recall considering whether to&para;<br>pursue that issue. Trotter further testified that he had&para;<br>unsuccessfully attempted to subpoena Wood’s school re&para;<br>cords and that he did not recall speaking to any of Wood’s&para;<br>teachers. Trotter had also written to an attorney at the&para;<br>Southern Poverty Law Center explaining that he was&para;<br>“ ‘stressed out over this case and [didn’t] have anyone with&para;<br>whom to discuss the case, including the other two attor&para;<br>neys.’ ” Id., at 1241. Shortly before the penalty phase&para;<br>began, Trotter told the judge that he would request fur&para;<br>ther psychological evaluation before the judge’s sentencing&para;<br>hearing, even though the evaluation would come too late&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to be considered by the jury. Id., at 1241–1242. Based on&para;<br>this evidence, the District Court concluded that the state&para;<br>court’s finding “that a strategic decision was made not to&para;<br>investigate or introduce to the sentencing jury evidence of&para;<br>mental retardation [was] an unreasonable determination&para;<br>of the facts in light of the clear and convincing evidence&para;<br>presented in the record.” Ibid.&para;<br>Having rejected the state court’s factual determinations,&para;<br>the District Court held that counsel’s performance was&para;<br>deficient and that counsel’s deficient performance preju&para;<br>diced Wood, concluding that the state court’s holdings to&para;<br>the contrary constituted “an unreasonable application of&para;<br>federal law under Strickland.” Id., at 1245. The court&para;<br>granted the petition on this claim and ordered the State&para;<br>either to resentence Wood to life without parole or to&para;<br>conduct a new sentencing hearing.&para;<br>In a divided opinion, the Eleventh Circuit reversed the&para;<br>grant of habeas relief. 542 F. 3d 1281 (2008). The major&para;<br>ity began by explaining the standard of review: “Section&para;<br>2254(d) permits federal habeas relief only where the state&para;<br>courts’ decisions were (1) ‘contrary to, or involved an un&para;<br>reasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,&para;<br>as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,’&para;<br>or (2) ‘based on an unreasonable determination of the facts&para;<br>in light of the evidence presented in the State court pro&para;<br>ceeding.’ ” Id., at 1285 (quoting §§2254(d)(1)–(2)). A “ ‘de&para;<br>termination of a factual issue made by a State court shall&para;<br>be presumed to be correct,’ ” the majority explained, and&para;<br>the petitioner “ ‘shall have the burden of rebutting the&para;<br>presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evi&para;<br>dence.’ ” Ibid. (quoting §2254(e)(1)). “Thus,” the majority&para;<br>stated, the federal habeas court’s “ ‘review of findings of&para;<br>fact by the state court is even more deferential than under&para;<br>a clearly erroneous standard of review.’ ” Ibid.&para;<br>The majority then held that the Alabama court’s rejec&para;<br>tion of Wood’s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>WOOD v. ALLEN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>neither an unreasonable application of clearly established&para;<br>law nor based on an unreasonable determination of the&para;<br>facts. With respect to the facts, the court concluded that&para;<br>the evidence presented in the Rule 32 hearings supported&para;<br>the state court’s findings that counsel made a strategic&para;<br>decision not to present mental health evidence during the&para;<br>penalty phase. “At a minimum,” the court noted, “Wood&para;<br>has not presented evidence, much less clear and convinc&para;<br>ing evidence, that counsel did not make such decisions.”&para;<br>Id., at 1304, n. 23. The court also agreed with the state&para;<br>court’s legal conclusion that counsel’s strategic decision&para;<br>was reasonable. According to the court, the silent record&para;<br>created a presumption that counsel exercised sound pro&para;<br>fessional judgment, supported by ample reasons, not to&para;<br>present the information they had obtained. These reasons&para;<br>included unfavorable information in Dr. Kirkland’s report,&para;<br>such as details about Wood’s 19 earlier arrests and his&para;<br>previous attempt to murder another ex-girlfriend, as well&para;<br>as Dr. Kirkland’s conclusion that, notwithstanding Wood’s&para;<br>mental deficiencies, Wood had a high level of adaptive&para;<br>functioning. Id., at 1304–1306. The court added that the&para;<br>investigation preceding counsel’s decision was sufficient to&para;<br>permit them to make a reasoned decision, crediting the&para;<br>Rule 32 court’s findings that, inter alia, counsel not only&para;<br>employed an investigator who sought mitigation evidence&para;<br>from family members but also themselves met with family&para;<br>members and sought guidance from capital defense or&para;<br>ganizations. Id., at 1307–1308. The court also accepted as&para;<br>not “objectively unreasonable” the state court’s determina&para;<br>tion that Wood had failed to show prejudice from counsel’s&para;<br>failure to present evidence of his mental deficiencies. Id.,&para;<br>at 1309, 1314.&para;<br>The dissent, implicitly considering the factual question&para;<br>whether counsel made a strategic decision as part and&para;<br>parcel of the legal question whether any strategic decision&para;<br>was reasonable, concluded that “[n]o such strategic deci&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sions could possibly have been made in this case because&para;<br>counsel had failed to adequately investigate the available&para;<br>mitigating evidence.” Id., at 1316. According to the dis&para;<br>sent, “the weight of the evidence in the record demon&para;<br>strates that Trotter, an inexperienced and overwhelmed&para;<br>attorney,” unassisted by senior counsel, “realized too&para;<br>late”—only in time to present it to the sentencing judge,&para;<br>not to the penalty jury—“what any reasonably prepared&para;<br>attorney would have known: that evidence of Wood’s men&para;<br>tal impairments could have served as mitigating evidence&para;<br>and deserved investigation so that it could properly be&para;<br>presented before sentencing.” Id., at 1320. The dissent&para;<br>also concluded that there was a reasonable probability of a&para;<br>different outcome at the penalty phase had the evidence&para;<br>been presented, because the jury could have concluded&para;<br>that Wood was less culpable as a result of his diminished&para;<br>abilities. Id., at 1322–1325. The dissent therefore con&para;<br>cluded that the state court’s application of Strickland to&para;<br>the facts of this case was unreasonable. 542 F. 3d, at&para;<br>1326.&para;<br>We granted certiorari to resolve two related questions&para;<br>raised by Wood’s petition. First, we granted review of a&para;<br>question that has divided the Courts of Appeals: whether,&para;<br>in order to satisfy §2254(d)(2), a petitioner must establish&para;<br>only that the state-court factual determination on which&para;<br>the decision was based was “unreasonable,” or whether&para;<br>§2254(e)(1) additionally requires a petitioner to rebut a&para;<br>presumption that the determination was correct with clear&para;<br>and convincing evidence.1 We also granted review of the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1See, e.g., 542 F. 3d 1281, 1285, 1304, n. 23 (CA11 2008) (decision&para;<br>below); Taylor v.

For present pur&para;<br>poses, we assume for the sake of argument that the factual&para;<br>determination at issue should be reviewed, as Wood urges,&para;<br>only under §2254(d)(2) and not under §2254(e)(1). We&para;<br>conclude that, under §2254(d)(2), the state court’s finding&para;<br>that Wood’s counsel made a strategic decision not to pur&para;<br>sue or present evidence of Wood’s mental deficiencies was&para;<br>not an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of&para;<br>the evidence presented in the state-court proceedings. We&para;<br>therefore do not need to decide whether that determina&para;<br>tion should be reviewed under the arguably more deferen&para;<br>tial standard set out in §2254(e)(1).&para;<br>As we have observed in related contexts, “[t]he term&para;<br>‘unreasonable’ is no doubt difficult to define.” Williams v.&para;<br>Taylor, 529 U.

It suffices to say, how&para;<br>ever, that a state-court factual determination is not un&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 In&para;<br>&para;<br>Wood’s view, when a petitioner seeks relief based entirely on the&para;<br>state-court record, a federal court reviews the state court’s findings for&para;<br>reasonableness under §2254(d)(2). Section 2254(e)(1) comes into play,&para;<br>according to Wood, only when a petitioner challenges individual state&para;<br>court factual findings based in part on evidence that is extrinsic to the&para;<br>state-court record. Brief for Petitioner 38–39. According to respon&para;<br>dents, §2254(e)(1) applies to any challenge to a state court’s factual&para;<br>findings under §2254(d)(2), including a challenge based solely on the&para;<br>state-court record.

ALLEN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Reviewing all of the evidence, we agree with the State&para;<br>that even if it is debatable, it is not unreasonable to con&para;<br>clude that, after reviewing the Kirkland report, counsel&para;<br>made a strategic decision not to inquire further into the&para;<br>information contained in the report about Wood’s mental&para;<br>deficiencies and not to present to the jury such informa&para;<br>tion as counsel already possessed about these deficiencies.&para;<br>Cf. Rice, supra, at 341–342. For that reason, we agree&para;<br>with the Court of Appeals that the District Court erred in&para;<br>holding to the contrary.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Wood also argues that the state-court decision involved&para;<br>an unreasonable application of Strickland under&para;<br>§2254(d)(1) because counsel failed to make a reasonable&para;<br>investigation of Wood’s mental deficiencies before deciding&para;<br>not to pursue or present such evidence. Without a reason&para;<br>able investigation, Wood contends, these decisions were an&para;<br>unreasonable exercise of professional judgment and con&para;<br>stituted deficient performance under Strickland. We&para;<br>agree with the State, however, that this argument is not&para;<br>“fairly included” in the questions presented under this&para;<br>Court’s Rule 14.1(a). Whether the state court reasonably&para;<br>determined that there was a strategic decision under&para;<br>§2254(d)(2) is a different question from whether the stra&para;<br>tegic decision itself was a reasonable exercise of profes&para;<br>——————&para;<br>decision successfully thwarted the prosecutor’s efforts to admit evidence&para;<br>that Wood murdered his ex-girlfriend while on parole for an attempted&para;<br>murder of a different ex-girlfriend that was strikingly similar in execu&para;<br>tion to the subsequent successful murder. App. 23–24. Moreover, as&para;<br>the Eleventh Circuit majority noted, evidence of Wood’s mental defi&para;<br>ciencies also could have undercut the defense’s argument that he left&para;<br>school to support his family, suggesting instead that he left school&para;<br>because of educational difficulties. 542 F. 3d, at 1305–1306.

See, e.g., Wiggins,&para;<br>539 U. S., at 522 (explaining that “counsel’s failure to uncover and&para;<br>present voluminous mitigating evidence at sentencing could not be&para;<br>justified as a tactical decision to focus on [defendant’s] voluntary&para;<br>confessions, because counsel had not ‘fulfill[ed] their obligation to&para;<br>conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant’s background’ ”&para;<br>(quoting Williams, 529 U.
