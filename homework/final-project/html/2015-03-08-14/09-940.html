S. C. §16901 et seq., violate the Ex&para;<br>Post Facto Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, §9, cl. 3,&para;<br>when applied to juveniles adjudicated as delinquent before&para;<br>SORNA’s enactment. We conclude that the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals had no authority to enter that judgment because it&para;<br>had no live controversy before it.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Respondent Juvenile Male was 13 years old when he&para;<br>began sexually abusing a 10-year-old boy on the Fort&para;<br>Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana. The abuse&para;<br>continued for approximately two years, until respondent&para;<br>was 15 and his victim 12. In 2005, respondent was&para;<br>charged in the District of Montana with delinquency&para;<br>under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act, 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§5031 et seq. Respondent pleaded “true” to charges that&para;<br>he knowingly engaged in sexual acts with a child under&para;<br>12, which would have been a federal crime had respondent&para;<br>been an adult. See §§2241(c), 1153(a). The court sen&para;<br>tenced respondent to two years of juvenile detention,&para;<br>followed by juvenile supervision until his 21st birthday.&para;<br>Respondent was to spend the first six months of his post&para;<br>confinement supervision in a prerelease center. See&para;<br>United States v. Juvenile Male, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)&para;<br>(per curiam) (slip op., at 1).&para;<br>In 2006, while respondent remained in juvenile deten&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JUVENILE MALE&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>tion, Congress enacted SORNA. 120 Stat. 590. Under&para;<br>SORNA, a sex offender must “register, and keep the re&para;<br>gistration current, in each jurisdiction” where the offen&para;<br>der resides, is employed, or attends school. 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§16913(a). This registration requirement extends to cer&para;<br>tain juveniles adjudicated as delinquent for serious sex&para;<br>offenses. §16911(8). In addition, an interim rule issued by&para;<br>the Attorney General mandates that SORNA’s require&para;<br>ments apply retroactively to sex offenders convicted before&para;<br>the statute’s enactment. 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (2007) (codi&para;<br>fied at 28 CFR pt. 72 (2010)); see 42 U. S. C. §16913(d).1&para;<br>In July 2007, the District Court determined that re&para;<br>spondent had failed to comply with the requirements of&para;<br>his prerelease program. The court revoked respondent’s&para;<br>juvenile supervision, imposed an additional 6-month term&para;<br>of detention, and ordered that the detention be followed by&para;<br>supervision until respondent’s 21st birthday. 560 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 1–2). At the Government’s urging, and&para;<br>over respondent’s objection, the court also imposed a&para;<br>“special conditio[n]” of supervision requiring respondent to&para;<br>register and keep current as a sex offender. Id., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 2) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 9 (noting the Government’s argument in the&para;<br>District Court that respondent should be required to regis&para;<br>ter under SORNA “ ‘at least until’ ” his release from juve&para;<br>nile supervision on his 21st birthday).&para;<br>On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, respondent challenged&para;<br>this “special conditio[n]” of supervision. He requested that&para;<br>the Court of Appeals “reverse th[e] portion of his sentence&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 On December 29, 2010, the Attorney General finalized the interim&para;<br>rule. See 75 Fed. Reg. 81849. In Reynolds v. United States, No. 10–&para;<br>6549, this Court granted certiorari on the question whether sex offend&para;<br>ers convicted before the enactment of SORNA have standing to chal&para;<br>lenge the validity of the Attorney General’s interim rule. 562 U.

Then, in May 2008, with his appeal still&para;<br>pending in the Ninth Circuit, respondent turned 21, and&para;<br>the juvenile-supervision order requiring him to register as&para;<br>a sex offender expired. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).&para;<br>Over a year after respondent’s 21st birthday, the Court&para;<br>of Appeals handed down its decision. 581 F. 3d 977 (CA9&para;<br>2009), amended, 590 F. 3d 924 (2010). No party had&para;<br>raised any issue of mootness in the Ninth Circuit, and the&para;<br>Court of Appeals did not address the issue sua sponte.&para;<br>The court’s opinion discussed only the merits and con&para;<br>cluded that applying SORNA to juvenile delinquents who&para;<br>committed their offenses “before SORNA’s passage vio&para;<br>lates the Ex Post Facto Clause.” Id., at 927. On that&para;<br>basis, the court vacated the District Court’s condition of&para;<br>supervision requiring sex-offender registration and report&para;<br>ing. Id., at 942. The United States petitioned for a writ of&para;<br>certiorari.&para;<br>While that petition was pending, this Court entered a&para;<br>per curiam opinion in this case certifying a preliminary&para;<br>question of Montana law to the Montana Supreme Court.&para;<br>560 U. S. ___ (2010). The opinion noted that a “threshold&para;<br>issue of mootness” might prevent us from reviewing the&para;<br>decision below on the merits. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2).&para;<br>We explained that, because respondent is “no longer . . .&para;<br>subject” to the District Court’s “sex-offender-registration&para;<br>conditions,” respondent must “show that a decision invali&para;<br>dating” those conditions “would be sufficiently likely to&para;<br>redress ‘collateral consequences adequate to meet Article&para;<br>III’s injury-in-fact requirement.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>2–3) (quoting Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 14 (1998)).&para;<br>We noted that by the time of the Ninth Circuit’s decision,&para;<br>“respondent had become registered as a sex offender in&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JUVENILE MALE&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Montana.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quota&para;<br>tion marks omitted). Thus, “[p]erhaps the most likely&para;<br>potential ‘collateral consequenc[e]’ that might be remedied&para;<br>by a judgment in respondent’s favor is the requirement&para;<br>that respondent remain registered as a sex offender under&para;<br>Montana law.” Ibid. In order to ascertain whether a&para;<br>decision invalidating the District Court’s registration&para;<br>conditions would enable respondent to remove his name&para;<br>from the Montana sex-offender registry, the Court certi&para;<br>fied the following question to the Montana Supreme&para;<br>Court:&para;<br>“Is respondent’s duty to remain registered as a sex&para;<br>offender under Montana law contingent upon the&para;<br>validity of the conditions of his now-expired federal&para;<br>juvenile-supervision order that required him to regis&para;<br>ter as a sex offender, or is the duty an independent&para;<br>requirement of Montana law that is unaffected by&para;<br>the validity or invalidity of the federal juvenile&para;<br>supervision conditions?” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3)&para;<br>(citations omitted).&para;<br>The Montana Supreme Court has now responded to our&para;<br>certified question. See United States v. Juvenile Male, ___&para;<br>P. 3d ___, 2011 WL 2162807 (2011). Its answer is that&para;<br>respondent’s “state law duty to remain registered as a sex&para;<br>offender is not contingent upon the validity of the condi&para;<br>tions of his federal supervision order, but is an independ&para;<br>ent requirement of Montana law.” Id., at ___, 2011 WL&para;<br>2162807,*1.&para;<br>II&para;<br>It is a basic principle of Article III that a justiciable case&para;<br>or controversy must remain “extant at all stages of review,&para;<br>not merely at the time the complaint is filed.” Arizonans&para;<br>for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 67 (1997)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). “[T]hroughout the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>litigation,” the party seeking relief “ ‘must have suffered,&para;<br>or be threatened with, an actual injury traceable to the de&para;<br>fendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial&para;<br>decision.’ ” Spencer, supra, at 7 (quoting Lewis v. Conti&para;<br>nental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472, 477 (1990)).&para;<br>In criminal cases, this requirement means that a defen&para;<br>dant wishing to continue his appeals after the expiration&para;<br>of his sentence must suffer some “continuing injury” or&para;<br>“collateral consequence” sufficient to satisfy Article III.&para;<br>See Spencer, 523 U. S., at 7–8. When the defendant chal&para;<br>lenges his underlying conviction, this Court’s cases have&para;<br>long presumed the existence of collateral consequences.&para;<br>Id., at 8; see Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40, 55–56&para;<br>(1968). But when a defendant challenges only an expired&para;<br>sentence, no such presumption applies, and the defendant&para;<br>must bear the burden of identifying some ongoing “collat&para;<br>eral consequenc[e]” that is “traceable” to the challenged&para;<br>portion of the sentence and “likely to be redressed by a&para;<br>favorable judicial decision.” See Spencer, supra, at 7, 14.&para;<br>At the time of the Ninth Circuit’s decision in this case,&para;<br>the District Court’s order of juvenile supervision had&para;<br>expired, and respondent was no longer subject to the sex&para;<br>offender-registration conditions that he sought to chal&para;<br>lenge on appeal. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). As a&para;<br>result, respondent’s challenge was moot before the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit unless he could “show that a decision invalidating”&para;<br>the District Court’s order would likely redress some collat&para;<br>eral consequence of the registration conditions. Id., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 2–3) (citing Spencer, supra, at 14).&para;<br>As we noted in our prior opinion, one “potential collat&para;<br>eral consequence that might be remedied” by an order&para;<br>invalidating the registration conditions “is the require&para;<br>ment that respondent remain registered” under Montana&para;<br>law. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks and brackets omitted). But as the Montana Su&para;<br>preme Court has now clarified, respondent’s “state law&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JUVENILE MALE&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>duty to remain registered as a sex offender is not contin&para;<br>gent upon the validity of the conditions of his federal&para;<br>supervision order,” 2011 WL 2162807, *1, and continues to&para;<br>apply regardless of the outcome in this case. True, a&para;<br>favorable decision in this case might serve as a useful&para;<br>precedent for respondent in a hypothetical lawsuit chal&para;<br>lenging Montana’s registration requirement on ex post&para;<br>facto grounds. But this possible, indirect benefit in a&para;<br>future lawsuit cannot save this case from mootness. See&para;<br>Camreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at&para;<br>16); Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Board of&para;<br>Trade of Chicago, 701 F. 2d 653, 656 (CA7 1989) (Posner,&para;<br>J.) (“[O]ne can never be certain that findings made in a&para;<br>decision concluding one lawsuit will not some day . . .&para;<br>control the outcome of another suit. But if that were&para;<br>enough to avoid mootness, no case would ever be moot”).&para;<br>Respondent also argues that this case “cannot be con&para;<br>sidered moot in any practical sense” because, under cur&para;<br>rent law, respondent may have “an independent duty to&para;<br>register as a sex offender” under SORNA itself. Brief in&para;<br>Opposition 6.2 But the duty to register under SORNA is&para;<br>not a consequence—collateral or otherwise—of the District&para;<br>Court’s special conditions of supervision. The statutory&para;<br>duty to register is, as respondent notes, an obligation that&para;<br>exists “independent” of those conditions. That continuing&para;<br>obligation might provide grounds for a pre-enforcement&para;<br>challenge to SORNA’s registration requirements. It does&para;<br>not, however, render the current controversy regarding&para;<br>the validity of respondent’s sentence any less moot.&para;<br>Respondent further argues that this case falls within&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 See 42 U. S. C. §16911(8) (SORNA applicable if the juvenile was “14&para;<br>years of age or older at the time of the offense and the offense adjudi&para;<br>cated was comparable to or more severe than aggravated sexual abuse&para;<br>(as described in section 2241 of title 18)”); 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at&para;<br>28 CFR pt. 72) (SORNA’s requirements extend to sex offenders con&para;<br>victed before the statute’s enactment).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

Bradford, 423 U. S. 147, 148–149&para;<br>(1975) (per curiam)). This exception, however, applies&para;<br>only where “(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration&para;<br>too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expira&para;<br>tion, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the&para;<br>same complaining party [will] be subject to the same&para;<br>action again.” Spencer, supra, at 17 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). At the very least, respondent cannot&para;<br>satisfy the second of these requirements. He has now&para;<br>turned 21, and he will never again be subject to an order&para;<br>imposing special conditions of juvenile supervision. See,&para;<br>e.g., DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312 (1974) (per cu&para;<br>riam). The capable-of-repetition exception to mootness&para;<br>thus does not apply, and the Ninth Circuit lacked&para;<br>the authority under Article III to decide this case on the&para;<br>merits.&para;<br>The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s&para;<br>motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.
