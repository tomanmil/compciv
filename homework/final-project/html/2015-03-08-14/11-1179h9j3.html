STEVE BULLOCK, ATTORNEY&para;<br>&para;<br>GENERAL OF MONTANA, ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME &para;<br>&para;<br>COURT OF MONTANA&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 11–1179. Decided June 25, 2012&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>A Montana state law provides that a “corporation may&para;<br>not make . . . an expenditure in connection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or opposes a&para;<br>candidate or a political party.” Mont. Code Ann. §13–&para;<br>35–227(1) (2011). The Montana Supreme Court rejected&para;<br>petitioners’ claim that this statute violates the First&para;<br>Amendment. 2011 MT 328, 363 Mont. 220, 271 P. 3d 1.&para;<br>In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, this&para;<br>Court struck down a similar federal law, holding that&para;<br>“political speech does not lose First Amendment protection&para;<br>simply because its source is a corporation.” 558 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2010) (slip op., at 26) (internal quotation marks omitted). The question presented in this case is whether the&para;<br>holding of Citizens United applies to the Montana state&para;<br>law. There can be no serious doubt that it does. See U. S.&para;<br>Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. Montana’s arguments in support of&para;<br>the judgment below either were already rejected in Citizens United, or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case.&para;<br>The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of&para;<br>the Supreme Court of Montana is reversed.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

Decided June 25, 2012&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.&para;<br>In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the&para;<br>Court concluded that “independent expenditures, includ­&para;<br>ing those made by corporations, do not give rise to corrup­&para;<br>tion or the appearance of corruption.” 558 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2010) (slip op., at 42). I disagree with the Court’s holding for the reasons expressed in Justice Stevens’ dissent&para;<br>in that case. As Justice Stevens explained, “technically in­&para;<br>dependent expenditures can be corrupting in much the&para;<br>same way as direct contributions.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>67–68). Indeed, Justice Stevens recounted a “substantial&para;<br>body of evidence” suggesting that “[m]any corporate inde­&para;<br>pendent expenditures . . . had become essentially inter­&para;<br>changeable with direct contributions in their capacity to&para;<br>generate quid pro quo arrangements.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 64–65).&para;<br>Moreover, even if I were to accept Citizens United, this&para;<br>Court’s legal conclusion should not bar the Montana Su­&para;<br>preme Court’s finding, made on the record before it, that&para;<br>independent expenditures by corporations did in fact lead&para;<br>to corruption or the appearance of corruption in Montana.&para;<br>Given the history and political landscape in Montana, that&para;<br>court concluded that the State had a compelling interest in&para;<br>limiting independent expenditures by corporations. 2011&para;<br>MT 328, ¶¶ 36–37, 363 Mont. 220, 235–236, 271 P. 3d 1,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN TRADITION PARTNERSHIP, INC. v. BULLOCK&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>36–37. Thus, Montana’s experience, like considerable ex­&para;<br>perience elsewhere since the Court’s decision in Citizens&para;<br>United, casts grave doubt on the Court’s supposition that&para;<br>independent expenditures do not corrupt or appear to do&para;<br>so.&para;<br>Were the matter up to me, I would vote to grant the&para;<br>petition for certiorari in order to reconsider Citizens United&para;<br>or, at least, its application in this case. But given the&para;<br>Court’s per curiam disposition, I do not see a significant&para;<br>possibility of reconsideration. Consequently, I vote in­&para;<br>stead to deny the petition.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
