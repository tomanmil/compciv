UNITED STATES&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 13–113.&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided December 2, 2013&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>When a taxpayer overpays his taxes, he is generally&para;<br>entitled to interest from the Government for the period&para;<br>between the payment and the ultimate refund. See 26&para;<br>U. S. C. §6611(a). That interest begins to run “from the&para;<br>date of overpayment.” §§6611(b)(1), (b)(2). But the Code&para;<br>does not define “the date of overpayment.”&para;<br>In this case, after the Internal Revenue Service advised&para;<br>Ford Motor Company that it had underpaid its taxes from&para;<br>1983 until 1989, Ford remitted a series of deposits to the&para;<br>IRS totaling $875 million. Those deposits stopped the accrual of interest that Ford would otherwise owe once the&para;<br>audits were completed and the amount of its underpayment was finally determined. See §6601; Rev. Proc. 84–&para;<br>58, 1984–2 Cum. Bull. 501. Later, Ford requested that the&para;<br>IRS treat the deposits as advance payments of the additional tax that Ford owed. Eventually the parties determined that Ford had overpaid its taxes in the relevant&para;<br>years, thereby entitling Ford to a return of the overpayment as well as interest. But the parties disagreed&para;<br>about when the interest began to run under 26 U. S. C.&para;<br>§6611(b)(1). Ford argued that “the date of overpayment”&para;<br>was the date that it first remitted the deposits to the IRS.&para;<br>Ibid. The Government countered that the date of overpayment was the date that Ford requested that the IRS&para;<br>treat the remittances as payments of tax. The difference&para;<br>between the parties’ competing interpretations of §6611(b)&para;<br>is worth some $445 million.&para;<br>Ford sued the Government in Federal District Court,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FORD MOTOR CO. v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>asserting jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. §1346(a)(1). The&para;<br>Government did not contest the court’s jurisdiction. See&para;<br>Brief in Opposition 3, n. 3. The District Court accepted&para;<br>the Government’s construction of §6611(b) and granted its&para;<br>motion for judgment on the pleadings. A panel of the&para;<br>Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, concluding&para;<br>that §6611 is a waiver of sovereign immunity that must be&para;<br>construed strictly in favor of the Government. 508 Fed.&para;<br>Appx. 506 (2012).&para;<br>Ford sought certiorari, arguing that the Sixth Circuit&para;<br>was wrong to give §6611 a strict construction. In Ford’s&para;<br>view, it is 28 U. S. C. §1346—not §6611—that waives the&para;<br>Government’s immunity from this suit, and §6611(b) is a&para;<br>substantive provision that should not be construed strictly.&para;<br>See Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, 553 U. S. 474, 491 (2008);&para;<br>United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S.&para;<br>465, 472–473 (2003). In its response to Ford’s petition for&para;<br>certiorari, however, the Government contended for the&para;<br>first time that §1346(a)(1) does not apply at all to this suit;&para;<br>it argues that the only basis for jurisdiction, and “the only&para;<br>general waiver of sovereign immunity that encompasses&para;<br>[Ford’s] claim,” is the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. §1491(a).&para;<br>Brief in Opposition 3, n. 3. Although the Government&para;<br>acquiesced in jurisdiction in the lower courts, if the Government is now correct that the Tucker Act applies to this&para;<br>suit, jurisdiction over this case was proper only in the&para;<br>United States Court of Federal Claims. See §1491(a).&para;<br>This Court “is one of final review, ‘not of first view.’ ”&para;<br>FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502, 529&para;<br>(2009) (quoting Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718,&para;<br>n. 7 (2005)). The Sixth Circuit should have the first opportunity to consider the Government’s new contention with&para;<br>respect to jurisdiction in this case. Depending on that&para;<br>court’s answer, it may also consider what impact, if any,&para;<br>the jurisdictional determination has on the merits issues,&para;<br>especially whether or not §6611 is a waiver of sovereign&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>immunity that should be construed strictly.&para;<br>The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of&para;<br>the Sixth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for&para;<br>further proceedings.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
