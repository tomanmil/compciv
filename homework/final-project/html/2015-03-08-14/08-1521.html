CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, &para;<br>&para;<br>ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1521. Argued March 2, 2010—Decided June 28, 2010&para;<br>Two years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, this&para;<br>Court held that the Second Amendment protects the right to keep&para;<br>and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense and struck down a Dis&para;<br>trict of Columbia law that banned the possession of handguns in the&para;<br>home. Chicago (hereinafter City) and the village of Oak Park, a Chi&para;<br>cago suburb, have laws effectively banning handgun possession by&para;<br>almost all private citizens. After Heller, petitioners filed this federal&para;<br>suit against the City, which was consolidated with two related ac&para;<br>tions, alleging that the City’s handgun ban has left them vulnerable&para;<br>to criminals. They sought a declaration that the ban and several re&para;<br>lated City ordinances violate the Second and Fourteenth Amend&para;<br>ments. Rejecting petitioners’ argument that the ordinances are un&para;<br>constitutional, the court noted that the Seventh Circuit previously&para;<br>had upheld the constitutionality of a handgun ban, that Heller had&para;<br>explicitly refrained from opining on whether the Second Amendment&para;<br>applied to the States, and that the court had a duty to follow estab&para;<br>lished Circuit precedent. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on&para;<br>three 19th-century cases—United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542,&para;<br>Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, and Miller v. Texas, 153 U. S. 535—&para;<br>which were decided in the wake of this Court’s interpretation of the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities Clause in the&para;<br>Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.&para;<br>567 F. 3d 856, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to&para;<br>Parts I, II–A, II–B, II–D, III–A, and III–B, concluding that the Four&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>teenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right, rec&para;<br>ognized in Heller, to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self&para;<br>defense. Pp. 5–9, 11–19, 19–33.&para;<br>(a) Petitioners base their case on two submissions. Primarily, they&para;<br>argue that the right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Privi&para;<br>leges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that&para;<br>the Slaughter-House Cases’ narrow interpretation of the Clause&para;<br>should now be rejected. As a secondary argument, they contend that&para;<br>the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause incorporates the&para;<br>Second Amendment right. Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respon&para;<br>dents) maintain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to&para;<br>the States only when it is an indispensable attribute of any “ ‘civi&para;<br>lized’ ” legal system. If it is possible to imagine a civilized country&para;<br>that does not recognize the right, municipal respondents assert, that&para;<br>right is not protected by due process. And since there are civilized&para;<br>countries that ban or strictly regulate the private possession of hand&para;<br>guns, they maintain that due process does not preclude such meas&para;<br>ures. Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(b) The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, originally&para;<br>applied only to the Federal Government, not to the States, see, e.g.,&para;<br>Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 247, but the&para;<br>constitutional Amendments adopted in the Civil War’s aftermath&para;<br>fundamentally altered the federal system. Four years after the adop&para;<br>tion of the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court held in the SlaughterHouse Cases, that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only&para;<br>those rights “which owe their existence to the Federal government,&para;<br>its National character, its Constitution, or its laws,” 16 Wall., at 79,&para;<br>and that the fundamental rights predating the creation of the Fed&para;<br>eral Government were not protected by the Clause, id., at 76. Under&para;<br>this narrow reading, the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities&para;<br>Clause protects only very limited rights. Id., at 79–80. Subse&para;<br>quently, the Court held that the Second Amendment applies only to&para;<br>the Federal Government in Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, Presser, 116&para;<br>U. S. 252, and Miller, 153 U. S. 535, the decisions on which the Sev&para;<br>enth Circuit relied in this case. Pp. 5–9.&para;<br>(c) Whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms&para;<br>applies to the States is considered in light of the Court’s precedents&para;<br>applying the Bill of Rights’ protections to the States. Pp. 11–19.&para;<br>(1) In the late 19th century, the Court began to hold that the Due&para;<br>Process Clause prohibits the States from infringing Bill of Rights pro&para;<br>tections. See, e.g., Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516. Five fea&para;<br>tures of the approach taken during the ensuing era are noted. First,&para;<br>the Court viewed the due process question as entirely separate from&para;<br>the question whether a right was a privilege or immunity of national&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>citizenship. See Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 99. Second, the&para;<br>Court explained that the only rights due process protected against&para;<br>state infringement were those “of such a nature that they are in&para;<br>cluded in the conception of due process of law.” Ibid. Third, some&para;<br>cases during this era “can be seen as having asked . . . if a civilized&para;<br>system could be imagined that would not accord the particular pro&para;<br>tection” asserted therein. Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149,&para;<br>n. 14. Fourth, the Court did not hesitate to hold that a Bill of Rights&para;<br>guarantee failed to meet the test for Due Process Clause protection,&para;<br>finding, e.g., that freedom of speech and press qualified, Gitlow v.&para;<br>New York, 268 U. S. 652, 666; Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283&para;<br>U. S. 697, but the grand jury indictment requirement did not, Hur&para;<br>tado, supra. Finally, even when such a right was held to fall within&para;<br>the conception of due process, the protection or remedies afforded&para;<br>against state infringement sometimes differed from those provided&para;<br>against abridgment by the Federal Government. Pp. 11–13.&para;<br>(2) Justice Black championed the alternative theory that §1 of&para;<br>the Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated all of the Bill of&para;<br>Rights’ provisions, see, e.g., Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46, 71–&para;<br>72 (Black, J., dissenting), but the Court never has embraced that the&para;<br>ory. Pp. 13–15.&para;<br>(3) The Court eventually moved in the direction advocated by&para;<br>Justice Black, by adopting a theory of selective incorporation by&para;<br>which the Due Process Clause incorporates particular rights con&para;<br>tained in the first eight Amendments. See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright,&para;<br>372 U. S. 335, 341. These decisions abandoned three of the charac&para;<br>teristics of the earlier period. The Court clarified that the governing&para;<br>standard is whether a particular Bill of Rights protection is funda&para;<br>mental to our Nation’s particular scheme of ordered liberty and sys&para;<br>tem of justice. Duncan, supra, at 149, n. 14. The Court eventually&para;<br>held that almost all of the Bill of Rights’ guarantees met the re&para;<br>quirements for protection under the Due Process Clause. The Court&para;<br>also held that Bill of Rights protections must “all . . . be enforced&para;<br>against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to&para;<br>the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal&para;<br>encroachment.” Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 10. Under this ap&para;<br>proach, the Court overruled earlier decisions holding that particular&para;<br>Bill of Rights guarantees or remedies did not apply to the States.&para;<br>See, e.g., Gideon, supra, which overruled Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S.&para;<br>455. Pp. 15–19.&para;<br>(d) The Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment&para;<br>right to keep and bear arms fully applicable to the States. Pp. 19–33.&para;<br>(1) The Court must decide whether that right is fundamental to&para;<br>the Nation’s scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>U. S. 145, 149, or, as the Court has said in a related context, whether&para;<br>it is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” Washing&para;<br>ton v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721. Heller points unmistakably to&para;<br>the answer. Self-defense is a basic right, recognized by many legal&para;<br>systems from ancient times to the present, and the Heller Court held&para;<br>that individual self-defense is “the central component” of the Second&para;<br>Amendment right. 554 U. S., at ___, ___. Explaining that “the need&para;<br>for defense of self, family, and property is most acute” in the home,&para;<br>ibid., the Court found that this right applies to handguns because&para;<br>they are “the most preferred firearm in the nation to ‘keep’ and use&para;<br>for protection of one’s home and family,” id., at ___, ___–___. It thus&para;<br>concluded that citizens must be permitted “to use [handguns] for the&para;<br>core lawful purpose of self-defense.” Id., at ___. Heller also clarifies&para;<br>that this right is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradi&para;<br>tions,” Glucksberg, supra, at 721. Heller explored the right’s origins&para;<br>in English law and noted the esteem with which the right was re&para;<br>garded during the colonial era and at the time of the ratification of&para;<br>the Bill of Rights. This is powerful evidence that the right was re&para;<br>garded as fundamental in the sense relevant here. That understand&para;<br>ing persisted in the years immediately following the Bill of Rights’&para;<br>ratification and is confirmed by the state constitutions of that era,&para;<br>which protected the right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 19–22.&para;<br>(2) A survey of the contemporaneous history also demonstrates&para;<br>clearly that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Framers and ratifiers&para;<br>counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental&para;<br>rights necessary to the Nation’s system of ordered liberty. Pp. 22–33.&para;<br>(i) By the 1850’s, the fear that the National Government would&para;<br>disarm the universal militia had largely faded, but the right to keep&para;<br>and bear arms was highly valued for self-defense. Abolitionist au&para;<br>thors wrote in support of the right, and attempts to disarm “FreeSoilers” in “Bloody Kansas,” met with outrage that the constitutional&para;<br>right to keep and bear arms had been taken from the people. After&para;<br>the Civil War, the Southern States engaged in systematic efforts to&para;<br>disarm and injure African Americans, see Heller, supra, at ___.&para;<br>These injustices prompted the 39th Congress to pass the Freedmen’s&para;<br>Bureau Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to protect the&para;<br>right to keep and bear arms. Congress, however, ultimately deemed&para;<br>these legislative remedies insufficient, and approved the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment. Today, it is generally accepted that that Amendment&para;<br>was understood to provide a constitutional basis for protecting the&para;<br>rights set out in the Civil Rights Act. See General Building Contrac&para;<br>tors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375, 389. In Congressional&para;<br>debates on the proposed Amendment, its legislative proponents in the&para;<br>39th Congress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a fun&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>damental right deserving of protection. Evidence from the period&para;<br>immediately following the Amendment’s ratification confirms that&para;<br>that right was considered fundamental. Pp. 22–31.&para;<br>(ii) Despite all this evidence, municipal respondents argue that&para;<br>Members of Congress overwhelmingly viewed §1 of the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment as purely an antidiscrimination rule. But while §1 does&para;<br>contain an antidiscrimination rule, i.e., the Equal Protection Clause,&para;<br>it can hardly be said that the section does no more than prohibit dis&para;<br>crimination. If what municipal respondents mean is that the Second&para;<br>Amendment should be singled out for special—and specially unfavor&para;<br>able—treatment, the Court rejects the suggestion. The right to keep&para;<br>and bear arms must be regarded as a substantive guarantee, not a&para;<br>prohibition that could be ignored so long as the States legislated in&para;<br>an evenhanded manner. Pp. 30–33.&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, and&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded, in Parts II–C, IV, and V, that the Four&para;<br>teenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause incorporates the Second&para;<br>Amendment right recognized in Heller. Pp. 10–11, 33–44.&para;<br>(a) Petitioners argue that that the Second Amendment right is one&para;<br>of the “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.”&para;<br>There is no need to reconsider the Court’s interpretation of the Privi&para;<br>leges or Immunities Clause in the Slaughter-House Cases because,&para;<br>for many decades, the Court has analyzed the question whether par&para;<br>ticular rights are protected against state infringement under the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. Pp. 10–11.&para;<br>(b) Municipal respondents’ remaining arguments are rejected be&para;<br>cause they are at war with Heller’s central holding. In effect, they&para;<br>ask the Court to hold the right to keep and bear arms as subject to a&para;<br>different body of rules for incorporation than the other Bill of Rights&para;<br>guarantees. Pp. 33–40.&para;<br>(c) The dissents’ objections are addressed and rejected. Pp. 41–44.&para;<br>JUSTICE THOMAS agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment makes&para;<br>the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms that was recog&para;<br>nized in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, fully applicable&para;<br>to the States. However, he asserted, there is a path to this conclusion&para;<br>that is more straightforward and more faithful to the Second&para;<br>Amendment’s text and history. The Court is correct in describing the&para;<br>Second Amendment right as “fundamental” to the American scheme&para;<br>of ordered liberty, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149, and&para;<br>“deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and traditions,” Washington v.&para;<br>Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721. But the Fourteenth Amendment’s&para;<br>Due Process Clause, which speaks only to “process,” cannot impose&para;<br>the type of substantive restraint on state legislation that the Court&para;<br>asserts. Rather, the right to keep and bear arms is enforceable&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>against the States because it is a privilege of American citizenship&para;<br>recognized by §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides, inter&para;<br>alia: “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the&para;<br>privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.” In inter&para;<br>preting this language, it is important to recall that constitutional&para;<br>provisions are “ ‘written to be understood by the voters.’ ” Heller, 554&para;<br>U. S., at ___. The objective of this inquiry is to discern what “ordi&para;<br>nary citizens” at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment’s ratification&para;<br>would have understood that Amendment's Privileges or Immunities&para;<br>Clause to mean. Ibid. A survey of contemporary legal authorities&para;<br>plainly shows that, at that time, the ratifying public understood the&para;<br>Clause to protect constitutionally enumerated rights, including the&para;<br>right to keep and bear arms.

A City ordinance provides that “[n]o person&para;<br>shall . . . possess . . . any firearm unless such person is the&para;<br>holder of a valid registration certificate for such firearm.”&para;<br>Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code §8–20–040(a) (2009). The&para;<br>Code then prohibits registration of most handguns, thus&para;<br>effectively banning handgun possession by almost all&para;<br>private citizens who reside in the City. §8–20–050(c).&para;<br>Like Chicago, Oak Park makes it “unlawful for any person&para;<br>to possess . . . any firearm,” a term that includes “pistols,&para;<br>revolvers, guns and small arms . . . commonly known as&para;<br>handguns.” Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code §§27–2–1&para;<br>(2007), 27–1–1 (2009).&para;<br>Chicago enacted its handgun ban to protect its residents&para;<br>“from the loss of property and injury or death from fire&para;<br>arms.” See Chicago, Ill., Journal of Proceedings of the&para;<br>City Council, p. 10049 (Mar. 19, 1982). The Chicago peti&para;<br>tioners and their amici, however, argue that the handgun&para;<br>ban has left them vulnerable to criminals. Chicago Police&para;<br>Department statistics, we are told, reveal that the City’s&para;<br>handgun murder rate has actually increased since the ban&para;<br>was enacted1 and that Chicago residents now face one of&para;<br>the highest murder rates in the country and rates of other&para;<br>violent crimes that exceed the average in comparable&para;<br>cities.2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 See Brief for Heartland Institute as Amicus Curiae 6–7 (noting that&para;<br>handgun murder rate was 9.65 in 1983 and 13.88 in 2008).&para;<br>2 Brief for Buckeye Firearms Foundation, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae&para;<br>8–9 (“In 2002 and again in 2008, Chicago had more murders than any&para;<br>other city in the U.

As a secon&para;<br>dary argument, petitioners contend that the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment’s Due Process Clause “incorporates” the&para;<br>Second Amendment right.&para;<br>Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respondents) main&para;<br>tain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to the&para;<br>States only if that right is an indispensable attribute of&para;<br>any “ ‘civilized’ ” legal system. Brief for Municipal Respon&para;<br>dents 9. If it is possible to imagine a civilized country that&para;<br>does not recognize the right, the municipal respondents&para;<br>tell us, then that right is not protected by due process.&para;<br>Ibid. And since there are civilized countries that ban or&para;<br>strictly regulate the private possession of handguns, the&para;<br>municipal respondents maintain that due process does not&para;<br>preclude such measures. Id., at 21–23. In light of the&para;<br>parties’ far-reaching arguments, we begin by recounting&para;<br>this Court’s analysis over the years of the relationship&para;<br>between the provisions of the Bill of Rights and the States.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment,&para;<br>originally applied only to the Federal Government. In&para;<br>Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243&para;<br>(1833), the Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Marshall,&para;<br>explained that this question was “of great importance” but&para;<br>“not of much difficulty.” Id., at 247. In less than four&para;<br>pages, the Court firmly rejected the proposition that the&para;<br>first eight Amendments operate as limitations on the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>States, holding that they apply only to the Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment. See also Lessee of Livingston v. Moore, 7 Pet.&para;<br>469, 551–552 (1833) (“[I]t is now settled that those amend&para;<br>ments [in the Bill of Rights] do not extend to the states”).&para;<br>The constitutional Amendments adopted in the after&para;<br>math of the Civil War fundamentally altered our country’s&para;<br>federal system. The provision at issue in this case, §1 of&para;<br>the Fourteenth Amendment, provides, among other&para;<br>things, that a State may not abridge “the privileges or&para;<br>immunities of citizens of the United States” or deprive&para;<br>“any person of life, liberty, or property, without due proc&para;<br>ess of law.”&para;<br>Four years after the adoption of the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment, this Court was asked to interpret the&para;<br>Amendment’s reference to “the privileges or immunities of&para;<br>citizens of the United States.” The Slaughter-House&para;<br>Cases, supra, involved challenges to a Louisiana law per&para;<br>mitting the creation of a state-sanctioned monopoly on the&para;<br>butchering of animals within the city of New Orleans.&para;<br>Justice Samuel Miller’s opinion for the Court concluded&para;<br>that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only&para;<br>those rights “which owe their existence to the Federal&para;<br>government, its National character, its Constitution, or its&para;<br>laws.” Id., at 79. The Court held that other fundamental&para;<br>rights—rights that predated the creation of the Federal&para;<br>Government and that “the State governments were cre&para;<br>ated to establish and secure”—were not protected by the&para;<br>Clause. Id., at 76.&para;<br>In drawing a sharp distinction between the rights of&para;<br>federal and state citizenship, the Court relied on two&para;<br>principal arguments. First, the Court emphasized that&para;<br>the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities&para;<br>Clause spoke of “the privileges or immunities of citizens of&para;<br>the United States,” and the Court contrasted this phrasing&para;<br>with the wording in the first sentence of the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment and in the Privileges and Immunities Clause&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of Article IV, both of which refer to state citizenship.5&para;<br>(Emphasis added.) Second, the Court stated that a con&para;<br>trary reading would “radically chang[e] the whole theory&para;<br>of the relations of the State and Federal governments to&para;<br>each other and of both these governments to the people,”&para;<br>and the Court refused to conclude that such a change had&para;<br>been made “in the absence of language which expresses&para;<br>such a purpose too clearly to admit of doubt.” Id., at 78.&para;<br>Finding the phrase “privileges or immunities of citizens of&para;<br>the United States” lacking by this high standard, the&para;<br>Court reasoned that the phrase must mean something&para;<br>more limited.&para;<br>Under the Court’s narrow reading, the Privileges or&para;<br>Immunities Clause protects such things as the right&para;<br>“to come to the seat of government to assert any claim&para;<br>[a citizen] may have upon that government, to trans&para;<br>act any business he may have with it, to seek its pro&para;<br>tection, to share its offices, to engage in administering&para;<br>its functions . . . [and to] become a citizen of any State&para;<br>of the Union by a bonâ fide residence therein, with the&para;<br>same rights as other citizens of that State.” Id., at&para;<br>79–80 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Finding no constitutional protection against state intru&para;<br>sion of the kind envisioned by the Louisiana statute, the&para;<br>Court upheld the statute. Four Justices dissented. Jus&para;<br>tice Field, joined by Chief Justice Chase and Justices&para;<br>Swayne and Bradley, criticized the majority for reducing&para;<br>the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment makes “[a]ll per&para;<br>sons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the juris&para;<br>diction thereof . . . citizens of the United States and of the State wherein&para;<br>they reside.” (Emphasis added.) The Privileges and Immunities Clause&para;<br>of Article IV provides that “[t]he Citizens of each State shall be entitled&para;<br>to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.”&para;<br>(Emphasis added.)&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v.

Id., at 96–97. Justice Bradley’s dis&para;<br>sent observed that “we are not bound to resort to implica&para;<br>tion . . . to find an authoritative declaration of some of the&para;<br>most important privileges and immunities of citizens of&para;<br>the United States. It is in the Constitution itself.” Id., at&para;<br>118. Justice Bradley would have construed the Privileges&para;<br>or Immunities Clause to include those rights enumerated&para;<br>in the Constitution as well as some unenumerated rights.&para;<br>Id., at 119. Justice Swayne described the majority’s nar&para;<br>row reading of the Privileges or Immunities Clause as&para;<br>“turn[ing] . . . what was meant for bread into a stone.” Id.,&para;<br>at 129 (dissenting opinion).&para;<br>Today, many legal scholars dispute the correctness of&para;<br>the narrow Slaughter-House interpretation.

In that case, the Court reviewed convictions&para;<br>stemming from the infamous Colfax Massacre in Louisi&para;<br>ana on Easter Sunday 1873. Dozens of blacks, many&para;<br>unarmed, were slaughtered by a rival band of armed white&para;<br>men.6 Cruikshank himself allegedly marched unarmed&para;<br>African-American prisoners through the streets and then&para;<br>had them summarily executed.7 Ninety-seven men were&para;<br>indicted for participating in the massacre, but only nine&para;<br>went to trial. Six of the nine were acquitted of all charges;&para;<br>the remaining three were acquitted of murder but con&para;<br>victed under the Enforcement Act of 1870, 16 Stat. 140, for&para;<br>banding and conspiring together to deprive their victims of&para;<br>various constitutional rights, including the right to bear&para;<br>arms.8&para;<br>The Court reversed all of the convictions, including&para;<br>those relating to the deprivation of the victims’ right to&para;<br>bear arms. Cruikshank, 92 U. S., at 553, 559. The Court&para;<br>wrote that the right of bearing arms for a lawful purpose&para;<br>“is not a right granted by the Constitution” and is not “in&para;<br>any manner dependent upon that instrument for its exis&para;<br>tence.” Id., at 553. “The second amendment,” the Court&para;<br>continued, “declares that it shall not be infringed; but this&para;<br>. . . means no more than that it shall not be infringed by&para;<br>Congress.” Ibid. “Our later decisions in Presser v.

CHICAGO&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>Court&para;<br>Opinion of&para;<br>of the&para;<br>ALITO&para;<br>, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>C&para;<br>As previously noted, the Seventh Circuit concluded that&para;<br>Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller doomed petitioners’&para;<br>claims at the Court of Appeals level. Petitioners argue,&para;<br>however, that we should overrule those decisions and hold&para;<br>that the right to keep and bear arms is one of the “privi&para;<br>leges or immunities of citizens of the United States.” In&para;<br>petitioners’ view, the Privileges or Immunities Clause&para;<br>protects all of the rights set out in the Bill of Rights, as&para;<br>well as some others, see Brief for Petitioners 10, 14, 15–21,&para;<br>but petitioners are unable to identify the Clause’s full&para;<br>scope, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–6, 8–11. Nor is there any consen&para;<br>sus on that question among the scholars who agree that&para;<br>the Slaughter-House Cases’ interpretation is flawed. See&para;<br>Saenz, supra, at 522, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).&para;<br>We see no need to reconsider that interpretation here.&para;<br>For many decades, the question of the rights protected by&para;<br>the Fourteenth Amendment against state infringement&para;<br>has been analyzed under the Due Process Clause of that&para;<br>Amendment and not under the Privileges or Immunities&para;<br>Clause. We therefore decline to disturb the SlaughterHouse holding.&para;<br>At the same time, however, this Court’s decisions in&para;<br>Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller do not preclude us from&para;<br>considering whether the Due Process Clause of the Four&para;<br>teenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right&para;<br>binding on the States. See Heller, 554 U. S., at ___, n. 23&para;<br>(slip op., at 48, n. 23). None of those cases “engage[d] in&para;<br>the sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by&para;<br>our later cases.” Ibid. As explained more fully below,&para;<br>Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller all preceded the era in&para;<br>which the Court began the process of “selective incorpo&para;<br>ration” under the Due Process Clause, and we have never&para;<br>previously addressed the question whether the right to&para;<br>keep and bear arms applies to the States under that&para;<br>theory.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Indeed, Cruikshank has not prevented us from holding&para;<br>that other rights that were at issue in that case are bind&para;<br>ing on the States through the Due Process Clause. In&para;<br>Cruikshank, the Court held that the general “right of the&para;<br>people peaceably to assemble for lawful purposes,” which&para;<br>is protected by the First Amendment, applied only against&para;<br>the Federal Government and not against the States. See&para;<br>92 U. S., at 551–552. Nonetheless, over 60 years later the&para;<br>Court held that the right of peaceful assembly was a “fun&para;<br>damental righ[t] . . . safeguarded by the due process clause&para;<br>of the Fourteenth Amendment.” De Jonge v. Oregon, 299&para;<br>U. S. 353, 364 (1937). We follow the same path here and&para;<br>thus consider whether the right to keep and bear arms&para;<br>applies to the States under the Due Process Clause.&para;<br>D&para;<br>1&para;<br>In the late 19th century, the Court began to consider&para;<br>whether the Due Process Clause prohibits the States from&para;<br>infringing rights set out in the Bill of Rights. See Hurtado&para;<br>v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884) (due process does not&para;<br>require grand jury indictment); Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co. v.&para;<br>Chicago, 166 U. S. 226 (1897) (due process prohibits&para;<br>States from taking of private property for public use with&para;<br>out just compensation). Five features of the approach&para;<br>taken during the ensuing era should be noted.&para;<br>First, the Court viewed the due process question as&para;<br>entirely separate from the question whether a right was a&para;<br>privilege or immunity of national citizenship. See Twin&para;<br>ing v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 99 (1908).&para;<br>Second, the Court explained that the only rights pro&para;<br>tected against state infringement by the Due Process&para;<br>Clause were those rights “of such a nature that they are&para;<br>included in the conception of due process of law.” Ibid.&para;<br>See also, e.g., Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46 (1947);&para;<br>Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942); Palko v. Connecticut,&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>302 U. S. 319 (1937); Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297&para;<br>U. S. 233 (1936); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45 (1932).&para;<br>While it was “possible that some of the personal rights&para;<br>safeguarded by the first eight Amendments against Na&para;<br>tional action [might] also be safeguarded against state&para;<br>action,” the Court stated, this was “not because those&para;<br>rights are enumerated in the first eight Amendments.”&para;<br>Twining, supra, at 99.&para;<br>The Court used different formulations in describing the&para;<br>boundaries of due process. For example, in Twining, the&para;<br>Court referred to “immutable principles of justice which&para;<br>inhere in the very idea of free government which no mem&para;<br>ber of the Union may disregard.” 211 U. S., at 102 (inter&para;<br>nal quotation marks omitted). In Snyder v. Massachu&para;<br>setts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934), the Court spoke of rights&para;<br>that are “so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our&para;<br>people as to be ranked as fundamental.” And in Palko, the&para;<br>Court famously said that due process protects those rights&para;<br>that are “the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty”&para;<br>and essential to “a fair and enlightened system of justice.”&para;<br>302 U. S., at 325.&para;<br>Third, in some cases decided during this era the Court&para;<br>“can be seen as having asked, when inquiring into&para;<br>whether some particular procedural safeguard was re&para;<br>quired of a State, if a civilized system could be imagined&para;<br>that would not accord the particular protection.” Duncan&para;<br>v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149, n. 14 (1968). Thus, in&para;<br>holding that due process prohibits a State from taking&para;<br>private property without just compensation, the Court&para;<br>described the right as “a principle of natural equity, rec&para;<br>ognized by all temperate and civilized governments, from&para;<br>a deep and universal sense of its justice.” Chicago, B. &amp;&para;<br>Q. R. Co., supra, at 238. Similarly, the Court found that&para;<br>due process did not provide a right against compelled&para;<br>incrimination in part because this right “has no place in&para;<br>the jurisprudence of civilized and free countries outside&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the domain of the common law.” Twining, supra, at 113.&para;<br>Fourth, the Court during this era was not hesitant to&para;<br>hold that a right set out in the Bill of Rights failed to&para;<br>meet the test for inclusion within the protection of the&para;<br>Due Process Clause. The Court found that some such&para;<br>rights qualified. See, e.g., Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S.&para;<br>652, 666 (1925) (freedom of speech and press); Near v.&para;<br>Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697 (1931) (same);&para;<br>Powell, supra (assistance of counsel in capital cases); De&para;<br>Jonge, supra (freedom of assembly); Cantwell v. Con&para;<br>necticut, 310 U. S. 296 (1940) (free exercise of religion).&para;<br>But others did not. See, e.g., Hurtado, supra (grand jury&para;<br>indictment requirement); Twining, supra (privilege&para;<br>against self-incrimination).&para;<br>Finally, even when a right set out in the Bill of Rights&para;<br>was held to fall within the conception of due process, the&para;<br>protection or remedies afforded against state infringement&para;<br>sometimes differed from the protection or remedies pro&para;<br>vided against abridgment by the Federal Government. To&para;<br>give one example, in Betts the Court held that, although&para;<br>the Sixth Amendment required the appointment of coun&para;<br>sel in all federal criminal cases in which the defendant&para;<br>was unable to retain an attorney, the Due Process Clause&para;<br>required appointment of counsel in state criminal proceed&para;<br>ings only where “want of counsel in [the] particular case&para;<br>. . . result[ed] in a conviction lacking in . . . fundamental&para;<br>fairness.” 316 U. S., at 473. Similarly, in Wolf v. Colo&para;<br>rado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949), the Court held that the “core of&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment” was implicit in the concept of&para;<br>ordered liberty and thus “enforceable against the States&para;<br>through the Due Process Clause” but that the exclusionary&para;<br>rule, which applied in federal cases, did not apply to the&para;<br>States. Id., at 27–28, 33.&para;<br>2&para;<br>An alternative theory regarding the relationship be&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tween the Bill of Rights and §1 of the Fourteenth Amend&para;<br>ment was championed by Justice Black. This theory held&para;<br>that §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated&para;<br>all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Adamson, supra, at 71–72 (Black, J., dissenting); Duncan,&para;<br>supra, at 166 (Black, J., concurring). As Justice Black&para;<br>noted, the chief congressional proponents of the Four&para;<br>teenth Amendment espoused the view that the Amend&para;<br>ment made the Bill of Rights applicable to the States and,&para;<br>in so doing, overruled this Court’s decision in Barron.9&para;<br>Adamson, 332 U. S., at 72 (dissenting opinion).10 None&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Senator Jacob Howard, who spoke on behalf of the Joint Committee&para;<br>on Reconstruction and sponsored the Amendment in the Senate, stated&para;<br>that the Amendment protected all of “the personal rights guarantied&para;<br>and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution.” Cong.&para;<br>Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2765 (1866) (hereinafter 39th Cong.&para;<br>Globe). Representative John Bingham, the principal author of the text&para;<br>of §1, said that the Amendment would “arm the Congress . . . with the&para;<br>power to enforce the bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution&para;<br>today.” Id., at 1088; see also id., at 1089–1090; A. Amar, The Bill of&para;<br>Rights: Creation and Reconstruction 183 (1998) (hereinafter Amar, Bill&para;<br>of Rights). After ratification of the Amendment, Bingham maintained&para;<br>the view that the rights guaranteed by §1 of the Fourteenth Amend&para;<br>ment “are chiefly defined in the first eight amendments to the Consti&para;<br>tution of the United States.” Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 84&para;<br>(1871). Finally, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, the political leader&para;<br>of the House and acting chairman of the Joint Committee on Recon&para;<br>struction, stated during the debates on the Amendment that “the&para;<br>Constitution limits only the action of Congress, and is not a limitation&para;<br>on the States. This amendment supplies that defect, and allows Con&para;<br>gress to correct the unjust legislation of the States.” 39th Cong. Globe&para;<br>2459; see also M. Curtis, No State Shall Abridge: The Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment and the Bill of Rights 112 (1986) (counting at least 30&para;<br>statements during the debates in Congress interpreting §1 to incorpo&para;<br>rate the Bill of Rights); Brief for Constitutional Law Professors as&para;<br>Amici Curiae 20 (collecting authorities and stating that “[n]ot a single&para;<br>senator or representative disputed [the incorporationist] understand&para;<br>ing” of the Fourteenth Amendment).&para;<br>10 The municipal respondents and some of their amici dispute the&para;<br>significance of these statements.

S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>theless, the Court never has embraced Justice Black’s&para;<br>“total incorporation” theory.&para;<br>3&para;<br>While Justice Black’s theory was never adopted, the&para;<br>Court eventually moved in that direction by initiating&para;<br>what has been called a process of “selective incorporation,”&para;<br>i.e., the Court began to hold that the Due Process Clause&para;<br>fully incorporates particular rights contained in the first&para;<br>eight Amendments. See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright, 372&para;<br>U. S. 335, 341 (1963); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 5–6&para;<br>——————&para;<br>leges or immunities” is not naturally read to mean the rights set out in&para;<br>the first eight Amendments, see Brief for Historians et al. as Amici&para;<br>Curiae 13–16, and that “there is ‘support in the legislative history for&para;<br>no fewer than four interpretations of the . . .

The Court&para;<br>eventually incorporated almost all of the provisions of the&para;<br>Bill of Rights.12 Only a handful of the Bill of Rights pro&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 By contrast, the Court has never retreated from the proposition&para;<br>that the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the Due Process Clause&para;<br>present different questions. And in recent cases addressing unenumer&para;<br>ated rights, we have required that a right also be “implicit in the&para;<br>concept of ordered liberty.” See, e.g., Washington v.

The Court has held that&para;<br>although the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury requires a unani&para;<br>mous jury verdict in federal criminal trials, it does not require a&para;<br>unanimous jury verdict in state criminal trials. See Apodaca v. Oregon,&para;<br>406 U. S. 404 (1972); see also Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U. S. 356&para;<br>(1972) (holding that the Due Process Clause does not require unani&para;<br>mous jury verdicts in state criminal trials). But that ruling was the&para;<br>result of an unusual division among the Justices, not an endorsement&para;<br>of the two-track approach to incorporation. In Apodaca, eight Justices&para;<br>agreed that the Sixth Amendment applies identically to both the&para;<br>Federal Government and the States. See Johnson, supra, at 395&para;<br>(Brennan, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, among those eight, four Jus&para;<br>tices took the view that the Sixth Amendment does not require unani&para;<br>mous jury verdicts in either federal or state criminal trials, Apodaca,&para;<br>406 U. S., at 406 (plurality opinion), and four other Justices took the&para;<br>view that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts in&para;<br>federal and state criminal trials, id., at 414–415 (Stewart, J., dissent&para;<br>ing); Johnson, supra, at 381–382 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Justice&para;<br>Powell’s concurrence in the judgment broke the tie, and he concluded&para;<br>that the Sixth Amendment requires juror unanimity in federal, but not&para;<br>state, cases.&para;<br>Apodaca, therefore, does not undermine the well&para;<br>established rule that incorporated Bill of Rights protections apply&para;<br>identically to the States and the Federal Government. See Johnson,&para;<br>supra, at 395–396 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted) (“In any&para;<br>event, the affirmance must not obscure that the majority of the Court&para;<br>remains of the view that, as in the case of every specific of the Bill of&para;<br>Rights that extends to the States, the Sixth Amendment’s jury trial&para;<br>guarantee, however it is to be construed, has identical application&para;<br>against both State and Federal Governments”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

In answering that question, as just explained, we&para;<br>must decide whether the right to keep and bear arms is&para;<br>fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan,&para;<br>391 U.

Thus, we concluded, citizens&para;<br>must be permitted “to use [handguns] for the core lawful&para;<br>purpose of self-defense.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 58).&para;<br>Heller makes it clear that this right is “deeply rooted in&para;<br>this Nation’s history and tradition.” Glucksberg, supra, at&para;<br>721 (internal quotation marks omitted). Heller explored&para;<br>the right’s origins, noting that the 1689 English Bill of&para;<br>Rights explicitly protected a right to keep arms for self&para;<br>defense, 554 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 19–20), and that&para;<br>by 1765, Blackstone was able to assert that the right to&para;<br>keep and bear arms was “one of the fundamental rights of&para;<br>Englishmen,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 20).&para;<br>Blackstone’s assessment was shared by the American&para;<br>colonists.

Fed&para;<br>eralists responded, not by arguing that the right was&para;<br>insufficiently important to warrant protection but by&para;<br>contending that the right was adequately protected by the&para;<br>Constitution’s assignment of only limited powers to the&para;<br>Federal Government. Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 25–&para;<br>26); cf. The Federalist No. 46, p. 296 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961)&para;<br>(J. Madison).

Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an&para;<br>Anglo-American Right 155–164 (1994). But those who&para;<br>were fearful that the new Federal Government would&para;<br>infringe traditional rights such as the right to keep and&para;<br>bear arms insisted on the adoption of the Bill of Rights as&para;<br>a condition for ratification of the Constitution.

Founding-era&para;<br>legal commentators confirmed the importance of the right&para;<br>to early Americans.

The unavoidable&para;<br>conclusion is that the Civil Rights Act, like the Freedmen’s&para;<br>Bureau Act, aimed to protect “the constitutional right to&para;<br>bear arms” and not simply to prohibit discrimination.

And in debating&para;<br>the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Congress routinely referred to&para;<br>the right to keep and bear arms and decried the continued&para;<br>disarmament of blacks in the South. See Halbrook,&para;<br>Freedmen 120–131. Finally, legal commentators from the&para;<br>period emphasized the fundamental nature of the right.&para;<br>See, e.g., T.

They argue&para;<br>that Members of Congress overwhelmingly viewed §1 of&para;<br>the Fourteenth Amendment “as an antidiscrimination&para;<br>rule,” and they cite statements to the effect that the sec&para;<br>tion would outlaw discriminatory measures. Id., at 64.&para;<br>This argument is implausible.&para;<br>First, while §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains&para;<br>“an antidiscrimination rule,” namely, the Equal Protection&para;<br>Clause, municipal respondents can hardly mean that §1&para;<br>does no more than prohibit discrimination. If that were&para;<br>so, then the First Amendment, as applied to the States,&para;<br>would not prohibit nondiscriminatory abridgments of the&para;<br>rights to freedom of speech or freedom of religion; the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment, as applied to the States, would not&para;<br>prohibit all unreasonable searches and seizures but only&para;<br>discriminatory searches and seizures—and so on. We&para;<br>assume that this is not municipal respondents’ view, so&para;<br>what they must mean is that the Second Amendment&para;<br>should be singled out for special—and specially unfavor&para;<br>able—treatment. We reject that suggestion.&para;<br>Second, municipal respondents’ argument ignores the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>36, 42).&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>clear terms of the Freedmen’s Bureau Act of 1866, which&para;<br>acknowledged the existence of the right to bear arms. If&para;<br>that law had used language such as “the equal benefit of&para;<br>laws concerning the bearing of arms,” it would be possible&para;<br>to interpret it as simply a prohibition of racial discrimina&para;<br>tion. But §14 speaks of and protects “the constitutional&para;<br>right to bear arms,” an unmistakable reference to the&para;<br>right protected by the Second Amendment. And it pro&para;<br>tects the “full and equal benefit” of this right in the States.&para;<br>14 Stat. 176–177. It would have been nonsensical for&para;<br>Congress to guarantee the full and equal benefit of a&para;<br>constitutional right that does not exist.&para;<br>Third, if the 39th Congress had outlawed only those&para;<br>laws that discriminate on the basis of race or previous&para;<br>condition of servitude, African Americans in the South&para;<br>would likely have remained vulnerable to attack by many&para;<br>of their worst abusers: the state militia and state peace&para;<br>officers. In the years immediately following the Civil War,&para;<br>a law banning the possession of guns by all private citi&para;<br>zens would have been nondiscriminatory only in the for&para;<br>mal sense. Any such law—like the Chicago and Oak Park&para;<br>ordinances challenged here—presumably would have&para;<br>permitted the possession of guns by those acting under the&para;<br>authority of the State and would thus have left firearms in&para;<br>the hands of the militia and local peace officers. And as&para;<br>the Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction&para;<br>revealed, see supra, at 24–25, those groups were widely&para;<br>involved in harassing blacks in the South.&para;<br>Fourth, municipal respondents’ purely antidiscrimina&para;<br>tion theory of the Fourteenth Amendment disregards the&para;<br>plight of whites in the South who opposed the Black&para;<br>Codes. If the 39th Congress and the ratifying public had&para;<br>simply prohibited racial discrimination with respect to the&para;<br>bearing of arms, opponents of the Black Codes would have&para;<br>been left without the means of self-defense—as had aboli&para;<br>tionists in Kansas in the 1850’s.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

It cannot&para;<br>be doubted that the right to bear arms was regarded as a&para;<br>substantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be&para;<br>ignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded&para;<br>manner.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Municipal respondents’ remaining arguments are at war&para;<br>with our central holding in Heller: that the Second&para;<br>Amendment protects a personal right to keep and bear&para;<br>arms for lawful purposes, most notably for self-defense&para;<br>within the home. Municipal respondents, in effect, ask us&para;<br>to treat the right recognized in Heller as a second-class&para;<br>right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than&para;<br>the other Bill of Rights guarantees that we have held to be&para;<br>incorporated into the Due Process Clause.&para;<br>Municipal respondents’ main argument is nothing less&para;<br>than a plea to disregard 50 years of incorporation prece&para;<br>dent and return (presumably for this case only) to a by&para;<br>gone era. Municipal respondents submit that the Due&para;<br>Process Clause protects only those rights “ ‘recognized by&para;<br>all temperate and civilized governments, from a deep and&para;<br>universal sense of [their] justice.’ ” Brief for Municipal&para;<br>Respondents 9 (quoting Chicago, B. &amp; Q.

Therefore, the municipal re&para;<br>spondents continue, because such countries as England,&para;<br>Canada, Australia, Japan, Denmark, Finland, Luxem&para;<br>bourg, and New Zealand either ban or severely limit&para;<br>handgun ownership, it must follow that no right to possess&para;<br>such weapons is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.&para;<br>Id., at 21–23.&para;<br>This line of argument is, of course, inconsistent with the&para;<br>long-established standard we apply in incorporation cases.&para;<br>See Duncan, 391 U.

This argument was made repeatedly and&para;<br>eloquently by Members of this Court who rejected the&para;<br>concept of incorporation and urged retention of the two&para;<br>track approach to incorporation. Throughout the era of&para;<br>“selective incorporation,” Justice Harlan in particular,&para;<br>invoking the values of federalism and state experimenta&para;<br>tion, fought a determined rearguard action to preserve the&para;<br>two-track approach.

Consider the exclusionary rule. Although the&para;<br>exclusionary rule “is not an individual right,” Herring v.&para;<br>United States, 555 U.

But what is most striking&para;<br>about their research is the paucity of precedent sustaining&para;<br>bans comparable to those at issue here and in Heller.&para;<br>Municipal respondents cite precisely one case (from the&para;<br>late 20th century) in which such a ban was sustained.

It is important to&para;<br>keep in mind that Heller, while striking down a law that&para;<br>prohibited the possession of handguns in the home, recog&para;<br>nized that the right to keep and bear arms is not “a right&para;<br>to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner&para;<br>whatsoever and for whatever purpose.” 554 U. S., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 54). We made it clear in Heller that our hold&para;<br>ing did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory&para;<br>measures as “prohibitions on the possession of firearms by&para;<br>felons and the mentally ill,” “laws forbidding the carrying&para;<br>&para;<br>40&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v.

We repeat those assurances here.&para;<br>Despite municipal respondents’ doomsday proclamations,&para;<br>incorporation does not imperil every law regulating&para;<br>firearms.&para;<br>Municipal respondents argue, finally, that the right to&para;<br>keep and bear arms is unique among the rights set out in&para;<br>the first eight Amendments “because the reason for codify&para;<br>ing the Second Amendment (to protect the militia) differs&para;<br>from the purpose (primarily, to use firearms to engage in&para;<br>self-defense) that is claimed to make the right implicit in&para;<br>the concept of ordered liberty.” Brief for Municipal Re&para;<br>spondents 36–37. Municipal respondents suggest that the&para;<br>Second Amendment right differs from the rights hereto&para;<br>fore incorporated because the latter were “valued for&para;<br>[their] own sake.” Id., at 33. But we have never previ&para;<br>ously suggested that incorporation of a right turns on&para;<br>whether it has intrinsic as opposed to instrumental value,&para;<br>and quite a few of the rights previously held to be incorpo&para;<br>rated—for example the right to counsel and the right to&para;<br>confront and subpoena witnesses—are clearly instrumen&para;<br>tal by any measure. Moreover, this contention repackages&para;<br>one of the chief arguments that we rejected in Heller, i.e.,&para;<br>that the scope of the Second Amendment right is defined&para;<br>by the immediate threat that led to the inclusion of that&para;<br>right in the Bill of Rights. In Heller, we recognized that&para;<br>the codification of this right was prompted by fear that the&para;<br>Federal Government would disarm and thus disable the&para;<br>militias, but we rejected the suggestion that the right was&para;<br>valued only as a means of preserving the militias. 554&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26). On the contrary, we stressed&para;<br>that the right was also valued because the possession of&para;<br>firearms was thought to be essential for self-defense. As&para;<br>we put it, self-defense was “the central component of the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 24 (Harlan, J., dissenting)).&para;<br>The question presented in this case, in his view, “is&para;<br>whether the particular right asserted by petitioners ap&para;<br>plies to the States because of the Fourteenth Amendment&para;<br>itself, standing on its own bottom.” Post, at 27. He would&para;<br>hold that “[t]he rights protected against state infringe&para;<br>ment by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause&para;<br>need not be identical in shape or scope to the rights pro&para;<br>tected against Federal Government infringement by the&para;<br>various provisions of the Bill of Rights.” Post, at 9.&para;<br>As we have explained, the Court, for the past half&para;<br>century, has moved away from the two-track approach. If&para;<br>we were now to accept JUSTICE STEVENS’ theory across the&para;<br>board, decades of decisions would be undermined. We&para;<br>assume that this is not what is proposed. What is urged&para;<br>instead, it appears, is that this theory be revived solely for&para;<br>the individual right that Heller recognized, over vigorous&para;<br>dissents.&para;<br>The relationship between the Bill of Rights’ guarantees&para;<br>and the States must be governed by a single, neutral&para;<br>principle. It is far too late to exhume what Justice Bren&para;<br>nan, writing for the Court 46 years ago, derided as “the&para;<br>notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the&para;<br>States only a watered-down, subjective version of the&para;<br>individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights.” Malloy,&para;<br>supra, at 10–11 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>&para;<br>42&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v.

To begin, while there is certainly room&para;<br>for disagreement about Heller’s analysis of the history of&para;<br>the right to keep and bear arms, nothing written since&para;<br>Heller persuades us to reopen the question there decided.&para;<br>Few other questions of original meaning have been as&para;<br>thoroughly explored.&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER’s conclusion that the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment does not incorporate the right to keep and&para;<br>bear arms appears to rest primarily on four factors: First,&para;<br>“there is no popular consensus” that the right is funda&para;<br>mental, post, at 9; second, the right does not protect mi&para;<br>norities or persons neglected by those holding political&para;<br>power, post, at 10; third, incorporation of the Second&para;<br>Amendment right would “amount to a significant incur&para;<br>sion on a traditional and important area of state concern,&para;<br>altering the constitutional relationship between the States&para;<br>and the Federal Government” and preventing local varia&para;<br>tions, post, at 11; and fourth, determining the scope of the&para;<br>Second Amendment right in cases involving state and&para;<br>local laws will force judges to answer difficult empirical&para;<br>questions regarding matters that are outside their area of&para;<br>expertise, post, at 11–16. Even if we believed that these&para;<br>factors were relevant to the incorporation inquiry, none of&para;<br>these factors undermines the case for incorporation of the&para;<br>right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.&para;<br>First, we have never held that a provision of the Bill of&para;<br>Rights applies to the States only if there is a “popular&para;<br>consensus” that the right is fundamental, and we see no&para;<br>basis for such a rule. But in this case, as it turns out,&para;<br>there is evidence of such a consensus. An amicus brief&para;<br>submitted by 58 Members of the Senate and 251 Members&para;<br>of the House of Representatives urges us to hold that the&para;<br>right to keep and bear arms is fundamental. See Brief for&para;<br>Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison et al. as Amici Curiae 4.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Brief for State of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 6.&para;<br>Second, petitioners and many others who live in high&para;<br>crime areas dispute the proposition that the Second&para;<br>Amendment right does not protect minorities and those&para;<br>lacking political clout. The plight of Chicagoans living in&para;<br>high-crime areas was recently highlighted when two Illi&para;<br>nois legislators representing Chicago districts called on&para;<br>the Governor to deploy the Illinois National Guard to&para;<br>patrol the City’s streets.31 The legislators noted that the&para;<br>number of Chicago homicide victims during the current&para;<br>year equaled the number of American soldiers killed dur&para;<br>ing that same period in Afghanistan and Iraq and that&para;<br>80% of the Chicago victims were black.32 Amici supporting&para;<br>incorporation of the right to keep and bear arms contend&para;<br>that the right is especially important for women and&para;<br>members of other groups that may be especially vulner&para;<br>able to violent crime.33 If, as petitioners believe, their&para;<br>safety and the safety of other law-abiding members of the&para;<br>community would be enhanced by the possession of hand&para;<br>guns in the home for self-defense, then the Second&para;<br>Amendment right protects the rights of minorities and&para;<br>other residents of high-crime areas whose needs are not&para;<br>being met by elected public officials.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>31 See Mack &amp; Burnette, 2 Lawmakers to Quinn: Send the Guard to&para;<br>Chicago, Chicago Tribune, Apr. 26, 2010, p. 6.&para;<br>32 Janssen &amp; Knowles, Send in Troops?

Incorpora&para;<br>tion always restricts experimentation and local variations,&para;<br>but that has not stopped the Court from incorporating&para;<br>virtually every other provision of the Bill of Rights. “[T]he&para;<br>enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes&para;<br>certain policy choices off the table.” Heller, 554 U.

This conclusion is no more remarkable&para;<br>with respect to the Second Amendment than it is with&para;<br>respect to all the other limitations on state power found in&para;<br>the Constitution.&para;<br>Finally, JUSTICE BREYER is incorrect that incorporation&para;<br>will require judges to assess the costs and benefits of&para;<br>firearms restrictions and thus to make difficult empirical&para;<br>judgments in an area in which they lack expertise. As we&para;<br>have noted, while his opinion in Heller recommended an&para;<br>interest-balancing test, the Court specifically rejected that&para;<br>suggestion. See supra, at 38–39. “The very enumeration&para;<br>of the right takes out of the hands of government—even&para;<br>the Third Branch of Government—the power to decide on&para;<br>a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth&para;<br>insisting upon.” Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 62–63).&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>In Heller, we held that the Second Amendment protects&para;<br>the right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose&para;<br>of self-defense.

Moreover, trusting the meaning&para;<br>of the Due Process Clause to what has historically been&para;<br>protected is circular, see post, at 19, since that would&para;<br>mean no new rights could get in.&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS moves on to the “most basic” con­&para;<br>straint on subjectivity his theory offers: that he would&para;<br>“esche[w] attempts to provide any all-purpose, top-down,&para;<br>totalizing theory of ‘liberty.’ ” Post, at 22.

Post, at 23. That is true, but JUSTICE&para;<br>STEVENS would have them show respect in an extraordi­&para;<br>nary manner. In his view, if a right “is already being&para;<br>given careful consideration in, and subjected to ongoing&para;<br>calibration by, the States, judicial enforcement may not be&para;<br>appropriate.” Ibid. In other words, a right, such as the&para;<br>right to keep and bear arms, that has long been recognized&para;<br>but on which the States are considering restrictions, ap­&para;<br>parently deserves less protection, while a privilege the&para;<br>political branches (instruments of the democratic process)&para;<br>have withheld entirely and continue to withhold, deserves&para;<br>more. That topsy-turvy approach conveniently accom­&para;<br>plishes the objective of ensuring that the rights this Court&para;<br>held protected in Casey, Lawrence, and other such cases fit&para;<br>the theory—but at the cost of insulting rather than re­&para;<br>specting the democratic process.&para;<br>The next constraint JUSTICE STEVENS suggests is harder&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>to evaluate. He describes as “an important tool for guiding&para;<br>judicial discretion” “sensitivity to the interaction between&para;<br>the intrinsic aspects of liberty and the practical realities of&para;<br>contemporary society.” Post, at 24. I cannot say whether&para;<br>that sensitivity will really guide judges because I have no&para;<br>idea what it is. Is it some sixth sense instilled in judges&para;<br>when they ascend to the bench? Or does it mean judges&para;<br>are more constrained when they agonize about the cosmic&para;<br>conflict between liberty and its potentially harmful conse­&para;<br>quences? Attempting to give the concept more precision,&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS explains that “sensitivity is an aspect of&para;<br>a deeper principle: the need to approach our work with&para;<br>humility and caution.” Ibid. Both traits are undeniably&para;<br>admirable, though what relation they bear to sensitivity is&para;<br>a mystery. But it makes no difference, for the first case&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS cites in support, see ibid., Casey, 505&para;<br>U. S., at 849, dispels any illusion that he has a meaningful&para;<br>form of judicial modesty in mind.&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS offers no examples to illustrate the&para;<br>next constraint: stare decisis, post, at 25. But his view of it&para;<br>is surely not very confining, since he holds out as a “ca­&para;<br>nonical” exemplar of the proper approach, see post, at 16,&para;<br>54, Lawrence, which overruled a case decided a mere 17&para;<br>years earlier, Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986),&para;<br>see 539 U. S., at 578 (it “was not correct when it was&para;<br>decided, and it is not correct today”). Moreover, JUSTICE&para;<br>STEVENS would apply that constraint unevenly: He appar­&para;<br>ently approves those Warren Court cases that adopted jot­&para;<br>for-jot incorporation of procedural protections for criminal&para;<br>defendants, post, at 11, but would abandon those Warren&para;<br>Court rulings that undercut his approach to substantive&para;<br>rights, on the basis that we have “cut back” on cases from&para;<br>that era before, post, at 12.&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS also relies on the requirement of a&para;<br>“careful description of the asserted fundamental liberty&para;<br>interest” to limit judicial discretion. Post, at 25 (internal&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). I certainly agree with that&para;<br>requirement, see Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993),&para;<br>though some cases JUSTICE STEVENS approves have not&para;<br>applied it seriously, see, e.g., Lawrence, supra, at 562&para;<br>(“The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its&para;<br>spatial and in its more transcendent dimensions”). But if&para;<br>the “careful description” requirement is used in the man­&para;<br>ner we have hitherto employed, then the enterprise of&para;<br>determining the Due Process Clause’s “conceptual core,”&para;<br>post, at 23, is a waste of time. In the cases he cites we&para;<br>sought a careful, specific description of the right at issue&para;<br>in order to determine whether that right, thus narrowly&para;<br>defined, was fundamental. See, e.g., Glucksberg, 521&para;<br>U. S., at 722–728; Reno, supra, at 302–306; Collins v.&para;<br>Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125–129 (1992); Cruzan v.&para;<br>Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 269–279&para;<br>(1990); see also Vacco v. Quill, 521 U. S. 793, 801–808&para;<br>(1997). The threshold step of defining the asserted right&para;<br>with precision is entirely unnecessary, however, if (as&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS maintains) the “conceptual core” of the&para;<br>“liberty clause,” post, at 23, includes a number of capa­&para;<br>cious, hazily defined categories. There is no need to define&para;<br>the right with much precision in order to conclude that it&para;<br>pertains to the plaintiff’s “ability independently to define&para;<br>[his] identity,” his “right to make certain unusually impor­&para;<br>tant decisions that will affect his own, or his family’s,&para;<br>destiny,” or some aspect of his “[s]elf-determination, bodily&para;<br>integrity, freedom of conscience, intimate relationships,&para;<br>political equality, dignity [or] respect.” Ibid. (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). JUSTICE STEVENS must there­&para;<br>fore have in mind some other use for the careful­&para;<br>description requirement—perhaps just as a means of&para;<br>ensuring that courts “procee[d] slowly and incrementally,”&para;<br>post, at 25. But that could be achieved just as well by&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v.

He offers several reasons for concluding that the&para;<br>Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is not&para;<br>fundamental enough to be applied against the States.5&para;<br>None is persuasive, but more pertinent to my purpose,&para;<br>each is either intrinsically indeterminate, would preclude&para;<br>incorporation of rights we have already held incorporated,&para;<br>or both. His approach therefore does nothing to stop a&para;<br>judge from arriving at any conclusion he sets out to reach.&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS begins with the odd assertion that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 After&para;<br>&para;<br>defending the careful-description criterion, JUSTICE STEVENS&para;<br>quickly retreats and cautions courts not to apply it too stringently.&para;<br>Post, at 26. Describing a right too specifically risks robbing it of its&para;<br>“universal valence and a moral force it might otherwise have,” ibid.,&para;<br>and “loads the dice against its recognition,” post, at 26, n. 25 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). That must be avoided, since it endangers&para;<br>rights JUSTICE STEVENS does like. See ibid. (discussing Lawrence v.&para;<br>Texas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003)). To make sure those rights get in, we must&para;<br>leave leeway in our description, so that a right that has not itself been&para;<br>recognized as fundamental can ride the coattails of one that has been.&para;<br>5 JUSTICE STEVENS claims that I mischaracterize his argument by&para;<br>referring to the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms,&para;<br>instead of “the interest in keeping a firearm of one’s choosing in the&para;<br>home,” the right he says petitioners assert. Post, at 38, n. 36. But it is&para;<br>precisely the “Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms” that&para;<br>petitioners argue is incorporated by the Due Process Clause. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. i. Under JUSTICE STEVENS’ own approach, that should end&para;<br>the matter. See post, at 26 (“[W]e must pay close attention to the&para;<br>precise liberty interest the litigants have asked us to vindicate”). In&para;<br>any event, the demise of watered-down incorporation, see ante, at 17–&para;<br>19, means that we no longer subdivide Bill of Rights guarantees into&para;<br>their theoretical components, only some of which apply to the States.&para;<br>The First Amendment freedom of speech is incorporated—not the&para;<br>freedom to speak on Fridays, or to speak about philosophy.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

The source of the rule that only nonambivalent liber­&para;<br>ties deserve Due Process protection is never explained—&para;<br>proof that judges applying JUSTICE STEVENS’ approach can&para;<br>add new elements to the test as they see fit. The criterion,&para;<br>moreover, is inherently manipulable. Surely JUSTICE&para;<br>STEVENS does not mean that the Clause covers only rights&para;<br>that have zero harmful effect on anyone. Otherwise even&para;<br>the First Amendment is out. Maybe what he means is&para;<br>that the right to keep and bear arms imposes too great a&para;<br>risk to others’ physical well-being. But as the plurality&para;<br>explains, ante, at 35–36, other rights we have already held&para;<br>incorporated pose similarly substantial risks to public&para;<br>safety. In all events, JUSTICE STEVENS supplies neither a&para;<br>standard for how severe the impairment on others’ liberty&para;<br>must be for a right to be disqualified, nor (of course) any&para;<br>method of measuring the severity.&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS next suggests that the Second&para;<br>Amendment right is not fundamental because it is “differ­&para;<br>ent in kind” from other rights we have recognized. Post, at&para;<br>37. In one respect, of course, the right to keep and bear&para;<br>arms is different from some other rights we have held the&para;<br>Clause protects and he would recognize: It is deeply&para;<br>grounded in our nation’s history and tradition. But&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS has a different distinction in mind:&para;<br>Even though he does “not doubt for a moment that many&para;<br>Americans . . . see [firearms] as critical to their way of life&para;<br>as well as to their security,” he pronounces that owning a&para;<br>handgun is not “critical to leading a life of autonomy,&para;<br>dignity, or political equality.”6 Post, at 37–38. Who says?&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 JUSTICE STEVENS goes a step farther still, suggesting that the right&para;<br>to keep and bear arms is not protected by the “liberty clause” because it&para;<br>is not really a liberty at all, but a “property right.” Post, at 38.

CHICAGO&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>Deciding what is essential to an enlightened, liberty-filled&para;<br>life is an inherently political, moral judgment—the an­&para;<br>tithesis of an objective approach that reaches conclusions&para;<br>by applying neutral rules to verifiable evidence.7&para;<br>No determination of what rights the Constitution of the&para;<br>United States covers would be complete, of course, without&para;<br>a survey of what other countries do.

Ibid. Never mind that&para;<br>he explains neither which countries qualify as “advanced&para;<br>democracies” nor why others are irrelevant. For there is&para;<br>an even clearer indication that this criterion lets judges&para;<br>pick which rights States must respect and those they can&para;<br>ignore: As the plurality shows, ante, at 34–35, and nn. 28–&para;<br>29, this follow-the-foreign-crowd requirement would fore­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>mind that the right to bear arms sounds mighty like a liberty; and&para;<br>never mind that the “liberty clause” is really a Due Process Clause&para;<br>which explicitly protects “property,” see United States v. Carlton, 512&para;<br>U. S. 26, 41–42 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). JUSTICE&para;<br>STEVENS’ theory cannot explain why the Takings Clause, which unques­&para;<br>tionably protects property, has been incorporated, see Chicago, B. &amp; Q.&para;<br>R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226, 241 (1897), in a decision he appears to&para;<br>accept, post, at 14, n. 14.&para;<br>7 As JUSTICE STEVENS notes, see post, at 51–52, I accept as a matter of&para;<br>stare decisis the requirement that to be fundamental for purposes of the&para;<br>Due Process Clause, a right must be “implicit in the concept of ordered&para;<br>liberty,” Lawrence, supra, at 593, n. 3 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). But that inquiry provides infinitely less&para;<br>scope for judicial invention when conducted under the Court’s ap­&para;<br>proach, since the field of candidates is immensely narrowed by the prior&para;<br>requirement that a right be rooted in this country’s traditions. JUSTICE&para;<br>STEVENS, on the other hand, is free to scan the universe for rights that&para;<br>he thinks “implicit in the concept, etc.” The point JUSTICE STEVENS&para;<br>makes here is merely one example of his demand that an historical&para;<br>approach to the Constitution prove itself, not merely much better than&para;<br>his in restraining judicial invention, but utterly perfect in doing so.

S. 833 (making no mention of&para;<br>foreign law).&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS also argues that since the right to&para;<br>keep and bear arms was codified for the purpose of “pre­&para;<br>vent[ing] elimination of the militia,” it should be viewed as&para;<br>“ ‘a federalism provision’ ” logically incapable of incorpora­&para;<br>tion. Post, at 41–42 (quoting Elk Grove Unified School&para;<br>Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 45 (2004) (THOMAS, J., con­&para;<br>curring in judgment); some internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). This criterion, too, evidently applies only when&para;<br>judges want it to. The opinion JUSTICE STEVENS quotes&para;<br>for the “federalism provision” principle, JUSTICE THOMAS’s&para;<br>concurrence in Newdow, argued that incorporation of the&para;<br>Establishment Clause “makes little sense” because that&para;<br>Clause was originally understood as a limit on congres­&para;<br>sional interference with state establishments of religion.&para;<br>Id., at 49–51. JUSTICE STEVENS, of course, has no problem&para;<br>with applying the Establishment Clause to the States.&para;<br>See, e.g., id., at 8, n. 4 (opinion for the Court by STEVENS,&para;<br>J.) (acknowledging that the Establishment Clause&para;<br>“appl[ies] to the States by incorporation into the Four­&para;<br>teenth Amendment”). While he insists that Clause is not a&para;<br>“federalism provision,” post, at 42, n. 40, he does not ex­&para;<br>plain why it is not, but the right to keep and bear arms is&para;<br>(even though only the latter refers to a “right of the peo­&para;<br>ple”). The “federalism” argument prevents the incorpora­&para;<br>tion of only certain rights.&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS next argues that even if the right to&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>keep and bear arms is “deeply rooted in some important&para;<br>senses,” the roots of States’ efforts to regulate guns run&para;<br>just as deep. Post, at 44 (internal quotation marks omit­&para;<br>ted). But this too is true of other rights we have held&para;<br>incorporated. No fundamental right—not even the First&para;<br>Amendment—is absolute. The traditional restrictions go&para;<br>to show the scope of the right, not its lack of fundamental&para;<br>character. At least that is what they show (JUSTICE&para;<br>STEVENS would agree) for other rights. Once again, prin­&para;<br>ciples are applied selectively.&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS’ final reason for rejecting incorpora­&para;<br>tion of the Second Amendment reveals, more clearly than&para;<br>any of the others, the game that is afoot. Assuming that&para;<br>there is a “plausible constitutional basis” for holding that&para;<br>the right to keep and bear arms is incorporated, he asserts&para;<br>that we ought not to do so for prudential reasons. Post, at&para;<br>47. Even if we had the authority to withhold rights that&para;<br>are within the Constitution’s command (and we assuredly&para;<br>do not), two of the reasons JUSTICE STEVENS gives for&para;<br>abstention show just how much power he would hand to&para;<br>judges. The States’ “right to experiment” with solutions to&para;<br>the problem of gun violence, he says, is at its apex here&para;<br>because “the best solution is far from clear.” Post, at 47–&para;<br>48 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is true of&para;<br>most serious social problems—whether, for example, “the&para;<br>best solution” for rampant crime is to admit confessions&para;<br>unless they are affirmatively shown to have been coerced,&para;<br>but see Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 444–445&para;<br>(1966), or to permit jurors to impose the death penalty&para;<br>without a requirement that they be free to consider “any&para;<br>relevant mitigating factor,” see Eddings v.

Post, at 49. That reflects an assump­&para;<br>tion that judges can distinguish between a proper democ­&para;<br>ratic decision to leave things alone (which we should&para;<br>honor), and a case of democratic market failure (which we&para;<br>should step in to correct). I would not—and no judge&para;<br>should—presume to have that sort of omniscience, which&para;<br>seems to me far more “arrogant,” post, at 41, than confin­&para;<br>ing courts’ focus to our own national heritage.&para;<br>III&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS’ response to this concurrence, post, at&para;<br>51–56, makes the usual rejoinder of “living Constitution”&para;<br>advocates to the criticism that it empowers judges to&para;<br>eliminate or expand what the people have prescribed: The&para;<br>traditional, historically focused method, he says, reposes&para;<br>discretion in judges as well.8 Historical analysis can be&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 JUSTICE&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS also asserts that his approach is “more faithful to&para;<br>this Nation’s constitutional history” and to “the values and commit­&para;<br>ments of the American people, as they stand today,” post, at 54. But&para;<br>what he asserts to be the proof of this is that his approach aligns (no&para;<br>surprise) with those cases he approves (and dubs “canonical,” ibid.).&para;<br>Cases he disfavors are discarded as “hardly bind[ing]” “excesses,” post,&para;<br>at 12, or less “enduring,” post, at 17, n. 16.

Or indeed, even more narrowly than&para;<br>that: whether it is demonstrably much better than what&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS proposes. I think it beyond all serious&para;<br>dispute that it is much less subjective, and intrudes much&para;<br>less upon the democratic process. It is less subjective&para;<br>because it depends upon a body of evidence susceptible of&para;<br>reasoned analysis rather than a variety of vague ethico­&para;<br>political First Principles whose combined conclusion can&para;<br>be found to point in any direction the judges favor. In the&para;<br>most controversial matters brought before this Court—for&para;<br>example, the constitutionality of prohibiting abortion,&para;<br>assisted suicide, or homosexual sodomy, or the constitu­&para;<br>tionality of the death penalty—any historical methodology,&para;<br>under any plausible standard of proof, would lead to the&para;<br>same conclusion.10 Moreover, the methodological differ­&para;<br>ences that divide historians, and the varying interpretive&para;<br>——————&para;<br>commitments of the American people” (and that is unclear, see post, at&para;<br>48–49, n. 47), it is hard to see how it shows fidelity to them that he&para;<br>disapproves a different subset of old cases than the Court does.&para;<br>9 That is not to say that every historical question on which there is&para;<br>room for debate is indeterminate, or that every question on which&para;<br>historians disagree is equally balanced. Cf. post, at 52–53. For exam­&para;<br>ple, the historical analysis of the principal dissent in Heller is as valid&para;<br>as the Court’s only in a two-dimensional world that conflates length&para;<br>and depth.&para;<br>10 By the way, JUSTICE STEVENS greatly magnifies the difficulty of an&para;<br>historical approach by suggesting that it was my burden in Lawrence to&para;<br>show the “ancient roots of proscriptions against sodomy,” post, at 53&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). Au contraire, it was his burden (in&para;<br>the opinion he joined) to show the ancient roots of the right of sodomy.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

What is more, his&para;<br>approach would not eliminate, but multiply, the hard&para;<br>questions courts must confront, since he would not replace&para;<br>history with moral philosophy, but would have courts&para;<br>consider both.&para;<br>And the Court’s approach intrudes less upon the democ­&para;<br>ratic process because the rights it acknowledges are those&para;<br>established by a constitutional history formed by democ­&para;<br>ratic decisions; and the rights it fails to acknowledge are&para;<br>left to be democratically adopted or rejected by the people,&para;<br>with the assurance that their decision is not subject to&para;<br>judicial revision. JUSTICE STEVENS’ approach, on the&para;<br>other hand, deprives the people of that power, since what­&para;<br>ever the Constitution and laws may say, the list of pro­&para;<br>tected rights will be whatever courts wish it to be. After&para;<br>all, he notes, the people have been wrong before, post, at&para;<br>55, and courts may conclude they are wrong in the future.&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS abhors a system in which “majorities or&para;<br>powerful interest groups always get their way,” post, at 56,&para;<br>but replaces it with a system in which unelected and life­&para;<br>tenured judges always get their way.

In Barron ex rel.&para;<br>Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243 (1833), this&para;<br>Court held that the Bill of Rights applied only to the Fed&para;<br>eral Government.

Now the relation of masters and slaves&para;<br>is, pro tanto, a total violation of this principle”).&para;<br>After the war, a series of constitutional amendments&para;<br>were adopted to repair the Nation from the damage slav&para;<br>ery had caused. The provision at issue here, §1 of the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment, significantly altered our system&para;<br>of government. The first sentence of that section provides&para;<br>that “[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States&para;<br>and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the&para;<br>United States and of the State wherein they reside.” This&para;<br>unambiguously overruled this Court’s contrary holding in&para;<br>Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857), that the&para;<br>Constitution did not recognize black Americans as citizens&para;<br>of the United States or their own State. Id., at 405–406.&para;<br>The meaning of §1’s next sentence has divided this&para;<br>Court for many years. That sentence begins with the&para;<br>command that “[n]o State shall make or enforce any law&para;<br>which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citi&para;<br>zens of the United States.” On its face, this appears to&para;<br>grant the persons just made United States citizens a&para;<br>certain collection of rights—i.e., privileges or immunities—&para;<br>attributable to that status.&para;<br>This Court’s precedents accept that point, but define the&para;<br>relevant collection of rights quite narrowly.&para;<br>In the&para;<br>Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36 (1873), decided just&para;<br>five years after the Fourteenth Amendment’s adoption, the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Opinion of THOMAS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Court interpreted this text, now known as the Privileges&para;<br>or Immunities Clause, for the first time. In a closely&para;<br>divided decision, the Court drew a sharp distinction be&para;<br>tween the privileges and immunities of state citizenship&para;<br>and those of federal citizenship, and held that the Privi&para;<br>leges or Immunities Clause protected only the latter cate&para;<br>gory of rights from state abridgment. Id., at 78. The&para;<br>Court defined that category to include only those rights&para;<br>“which owe their existence to the Federal government, its&para;<br>National character, its Constitution, or its laws.” Id., at&para;<br>79. This arguably left open the possibility that certain&para;<br>individual rights enumerated in the Constitution could be&para;<br>considered privileges or immunities of federal citizenship.&para;<br>See ibid. (listing “[t]he right to peaceably assemble” and&para;<br>“the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus” as rights poten&para;<br>tially protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause).&para;<br>But the Court soon rejected that proposition, interpreting&para;<br>the Privileges or Immunities Clause even more narrowly&para;<br>in its later cases.&para;<br>Chief among those cases is United States v. Cruikshank,&para;<br>92 U. S. 542 (1876). There, the Court held that members&para;<br>of a white militia who had brutally murdered as many as&para;<br>165 black Louisianians congregating outside a courthouse&para;<br>had not deprived the victims of their privileges as Ameri&para;<br>can citizens to peaceably assemble or to keep and bear&para;<br>arms. Ibid.; see L. Keith, The Colfax Massacre 109 (2008).&para;<br>According to the Court, the right to peaceably assemble&para;<br>codified in the First Amendment was not a privilege of&para;<br>United States citizenship because “[t]he right . . . existed&para;<br>long before the adoption of the Constitution.” 92 U. S., at&para;<br>551 (emphasis added). Similarly, the Court held that the&para;<br>right to keep and bear arms was not a privilege of United&para;<br>States citizenship because it was not “in any manner&para;<br>dependent upon that instrument for its existence.” Id., at&para;<br>553. In other words, the reason the Framers codified the&para;<br>right to bear arms in the Second Amendment—its nature&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of THOMAS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>as an inalienable right that pre-existed the Constitution’s&para;<br>adoption—was the very reason citizens could not enforce it&para;<br>against States through the Fourteenth.&para;<br>That circular reasoning effectively has been the Court’s&para;<br>last word on the Privileges or Immunities Clause.1 In the&para;<br>intervening years, the Court has held that the Clause&para;<br>prevents state abridgment of only a handful of rights, such&para;<br>as the right to travel, see Saenz v. Roe, 526 U. S. 489, 503&para;<br>(1999), that are not readily described as essential to&para;<br>liberty.&para;<br>As a consequence of this Court’s marginalization of the&para;<br>Clause, litigants seeking federal protection of fundamental&para;<br>rights turned to the remainder of §1 in search of an alter&para;<br>native fount of such rights. They found one in a most&para;<br>curious place—that section’s command that every State&para;<br>guarantee “due process” to any person before depriving&para;<br>him of “life, liberty, or property.” At first, litigants argued&para;<br>that this Due Process Clause “incorporated” certain proce&para;<br>dural rights codified in the Bill of Rights against the&para;<br>States. The Court generally rejected those claims, how&para;<br>ever, on the theory that the rights in question were not&para;<br>sufficiently “fundamental” to warrant such treatment.&para;<br>See, e.g., Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884)&para;<br>(grand jury indictment requirement); Maxwell v. Dow, 176&para;<br>U. S. 581 (1900) (12-person jury requirement); Twining v.&para;<br>New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78 (1908) (privilege against self&para;<br>incrimination).&para;<br>That changed with time. The Court came to conclude&para;<br>that certain Bill of Rights guarantees were sufficiently&para;<br>fundamental to fall within §1’s guarantee of “due process.”&para;<br>These included not only procedural protections listed in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 In the two decades after United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542&para;<br>(1876), was decided, this Court twice reaffirmed its holding that the&para;<br>Privileges or Immunities Clause does not apply the Second Amendment&para;<br>to the States. Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, 266–267 (1886); Miller&para;<br>v. Texas, 153 U. S. 535 (1894).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v.

Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697, 707 (1931)&para;<br>(same). In the process of incorporating these rights&para;<br>against the States, the Court often applied them differ&para;<br>ently against the States than against the Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment on the theory that only those “fundamental”&para;<br>aspects of the right required Due Process Clause protec&para;<br>tion. See, e.g., Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455, 473 (1942)&para;<br>(holding that the Sixth Amendment required the appoint&para;<br>ment of counsel in all federal criminal cases in which the&para;<br>defendant was unable to retain an attorney, but that the&para;<br>Due Process Clause required appointment of counsel in&para;<br>state criminal cases only where “want of counsel . . . re&para;<br>sult[ed] in a conviction lacking in . . . fundamental fair&para;<br>ness”). In more recent years, this Court has “abandoned&para;<br>the notion” that the guarantees in the Bill of Rights apply&para;<br>differently when incorporated against the States than they&para;<br>do when applied to the Federal Government. Ante, at 17–&para;<br>18 (opinion of the Court) (internal quotation marks omit&para;<br>ted). But our cases continue to adhere to the view that a&para;<br>right is incorporated through the Due Process Clause only&para;<br>if it is sufficiently “fundamental,” ante, at 37, 42–44 (plu&para;<br>rality opinion)—a term the Court has long struggled to&para;<br>define.&para;<br>While this Court has at times concluded that a right&para;<br>gains “fundamental” status only if it is essential to the&para;<br>American “scheme of ordered liberty” or “ ‘deeply rooted in&para;<br>this Nation’s history and tradition,’ ” ante, at 19 (plurality&para;<br>opinion) (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721), the Court&para;<br>has just as often held that a right warrants Due Process&para;<br>Clause protection if it satisfies a far less measurable range&para;<br>of criteria, see Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 562&para;<br>(2003) (concluding that the Due Process Clause protects&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Using the latter approach, the&para;<br>Court has determined that the Due Process Clause applies&para;<br>rights against the States that are not mentioned in the&para;<br>Constitution at all, even without seriously arguing that&para;<br>the Clause was originally understood to protect such&para;<br>rights. See, e.g., Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905);&para;<br>Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973); Lawrence, supra.&para;<br>All of this is a legal fiction. The notion that a constitu&para;<br>tional provision that guarantees only “process” before a&para;<br>person is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define&para;<br>the substance of those rights strains credulity for even the&para;<br>most casual user of words. Moreover, this fiction is a&para;<br>particularly dangerous one. The one theme that links the&para;<br>Court’s substantive due process precedents together is&para;<br>their lack of a guiding principle to distinguish “fundamen&para;<br>tal” rights that warrant protection from nonfundamental&para;<br>rights that do not. Today’s decision illustrates the point.&para;<br>Replaying a debate that has endured from the inception of&para;<br>the Court’s substantive due process jurisprudence, the&para;<br>dissents laud the “flexibility” in this Court’s substantive&para;<br>due process doctrine, post, at 14 (STEVENS, J., dissenting);&para;<br>see post, at 6–8 (BREYER, J., dissenting), while the plural&para;<br>ity makes yet another effort to impose principled re&para;<br>straints on its exercise, see ante, at 33–41. But neither&para;<br>side argues that the meaning they attribute to the Due&para;<br>Process Clause was consistent with public understanding&para;<br>at the time of its ratification.&para;<br>To be sure, the plurality’s effort to cabin the exercise of&para;<br>judicial discretion under the Due Process Clause by focus&para;<br>ing its inquiry on those rights deeply rooted in American&para;<br>history and tradition invites less opportunity for abuse&para;<br>than the alternatives. See post, at 7 (BREYER, J., dissent&para;<br>ing) (arguing that rights should be incorporated against&para;<br>the States through the Due Process Clause if they are&para;<br>“well-suited to the carrying out of . . . constitutional prom&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v.

But any&para;<br>serious argument over the scope of the Due Process Clause&para;<br>must acknowledge that neither its text nor its history&para;<br>suggests that it protects the many substantive rights this&para;<br>Court’s cases now claim it does.&para;<br>I cannot accept a theory of constitutional interpretation&para;<br>that rests on such tenuous footing. This Court’s substan&para;<br>tive due process framework fails to account for both the&para;<br>text of the Fourteenth Amendment and the history that&para;<br>led to its adoption, filling that gap with a jurisprudence&para;<br>devoid of a guiding principle.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).&para;<br>A&para;<br>1&para;<br>At the time of Reconstruction, the terms “privileges” and&para;<br>“immunities” had an established meaning as synonyms for&para;<br>“rights.” The two words, standing alone or paired to&para;<br>gether, were used interchangeably with the words “rights,”&para;<br>“liberties,” and “freedoms,” and had been since the time of&para;<br>Blackstone. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *129&para;<br>(describing the “rights and liberties” of Englishmen as&para;<br>“private immunities” and “civil privileges”). A number of&para;<br>antebellum judicial decisions used the terms in this man&para;<br>ner. See, e.g., Magill v. Brown, 16 F. Cas. 408, 428 (No.&para;<br>8,952) (CC ED Pa. 1833) (Baldwin, J.) (“The words ‘privi&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Opinion of THOMAS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>leges and immunities’ relate to the rights of persons, place&para;<br>or property; a privilege is a peculiar right, a private law,&para;<br>conceded to particular persons or places”). In addition,&para;<br>dictionary definitions confirm that the public shared this&para;<br>understanding. See, e.g., N. Webster, An American Dic&para;<br>tionary of the English Language 1039 (C. Goodrich &amp; N.&para;<br>Porter rev. 1865) (defining “privilege” as “a right or immu&para;<br>nity not enjoyed by others or by all” and listing among its&para;<br>synonyms the words “immunity,” “franchise,” “right,” and&para;<br>“liberty”); id., at 661 (defining “immunity” as “[f]reedom&para;<br>from an obligation” or “particular privilege”); id., at 1140&para;<br>(defining “right” as “[p]rivilege or immunity granted by&para;<br>authority”).2&para;<br>The fact that a particular interest was designated as a&para;<br>“privilege” or “immunity,” rather than a “right,” “liberty,”&para;<br>or “freedom,” revealed little about its substance. Black&para;<br>stone, for example, used the terms “privileges” and “im&para;<br>munities” to describe both the inalienable rights of indi&para;<br>viduals and the positive-law rights of corporations. See 1&para;<br>Commentaries, at *129 (describing “private immunities”&para;<br>as a “residuum of natural liberty,” and “civil privileges” as&para;<br>those “which society has engaged to provide, in lieu of the&para;<br>natural liberties so given up by individuals” (footnote&para;<br>omitted)); id., at *468 (stating that a corporate charter&para;<br>enables a corporation to “establish rules and orders” that&para;<br>serve as “the privileges and immunities . . . of the corpora&para;<br>tion”). Writers in this country at the time of Reconstruc&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 See also 2 C. Richardson, A New Dictionary of the English Language&para;<br>1512 (1839) (defining “privilege” as “an appropriate or peculiar law or&para;<br>rule or right; a peculiar immunity, liberty, or franchise”); 1 id., at 1056&para;<br>(defining “immunity” as “[f]reedom or exemption, (from duties,) liberty,&para;<br>privilege”); The Philadelphia School Dictionary; or Expositor of the&para;<br>English Language 152 (3d ed. 1812) (defining “privilege” as a “peculiar&para;<br>advantage”); id., at 105 (defining “immunity” as “privilege, exemption”);&para;<br>Royal Standard English Dictionary 411 (1788) (defining “privilege” as&para;<br>“public right; peculiar advantage”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Farmers’ Loan &amp; Trust Co., 49 Ill. 331,&para;<br>334 (1868) (describing agreement between two railroad&para;<br>companies in which they agreed “ ‘to fully merge and&para;<br>consolidate the[ir] capital stock, powers, privileges, immu&para;<br>nities and franchises’ ”); Hathorn v. Calef, 53 Me. 471,&para;<br>483–484 (1866) (concluding that a statute did not “modify&para;<br>any power, privileges, or immunity, pertaining to the&para;<br>franchise of any corporation”). The nature of a privilege or&para;<br>immunity thus varied depending on the person, group, or&para;<br>entity to whom those rights were assigned. See Lash, The&para;<br>Origins of the Privileges or Immunities Clause, Part I:&para;<br>“Privileges and Immunities” as an Antebellum Term of&para;<br>Art, 98 Geo. L. J. 1241, 1256–1257 (2010) (surveying&para;<br>antebellum usages of these terms).&para;<br>2&para;<br>The group of rights-bearers to whom the Privileges or&para;<br>Immunities Clause applies is, of course, “citizens.” By the&para;<br>time of Reconstruction, it had long been established that&para;<br>both the States and the Federal Government existed to&para;<br>preserve their citizens’ inalienable rights, and that these&para;<br>rights were considered “privileges” or “immunities” of&para;<br>citizenship.&para;<br>This tradition begins with our country’s English roots.&para;<br>Parliament declared the basic liberties of English citizens&para;<br>in a series of documents ranging from the Magna Carta to&para;<br>the Petition of Right and the English Bill of Rights. See 1&para;<br>B. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A Documentary History&para;<br>8−16, 19−21, 41−46 (1971) (hereinafter Schwartz). These&para;<br>fundamental rights, according to the English tradition,&para;<br>belonged to all people but became legally enforceable only&para;<br>when recognized in legal texts, including acts of Parlia&para;<br>ment and the decisions of common-law judges. See B.&para;<br>Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolu&para;<br>tion 77−79 (1967). These rights included many that later&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v.

They consistently claimed the rights of&para;<br>English citizenship in their founding documents, repeat&para;<br>edly referring to these rights as “privileges” and “immuni&para;<br>ties.” For example, a Maryland law provided that&para;<br>“[A]ll the Inhabitants of this Province being Chris&para;<br>tians (Slaves excepted) Shall have and enjoy all such&para;<br>rights liberties immunities priviledges and free cus&para;<br>toms within this Province as any naturall born subject&para;<br>of England hath or ought to have or enjoy in the&para;<br>Realm of England . . . .” Md.

See, e.g., 1 Annals&para;<br>of Cong. 431−432, 436–437, 440–442 (1834) (statement of&para;<br>Rep.

The Court’s subse&para;<br>quent decision in Barron, however, made plain that the&para;<br>codification of these rights in the Bill made them legally&para;<br>enforceable only against the Federal Government, not the&para;<br>States. See 7 Pet., at 247.&para;<br>3&para;<br>Even though the Bill of Rights did not apply to the&para;<br>States, other provisions of the Constitution did limit state&para;<br>interference with individual rights. Article IV, §2, cl. 1&para;<br>provides that “[t]he Citizens of each State shall be entitled&para;<br>to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several&para;<br>States.” The text of this provision resembles the Privi&para;<br>leges or Immunities Clause, and it can be assumed that&para;<br>the public’s understanding of the latter was informed by&para;<br>its understanding of the former.&para;<br>Article IV, §2 was derived from a similar clause in the&para;<br>Articles of Confederation, and reflects the dual citizenship&para;<br>the Constitution provided to all Americans after replacing&para;<br>that “league” of separate sovereign States.

By virtue of a person’s citizenship in a particular&para;<br>State, he was guaranteed whatever rights and liberties&para;<br>that State’s constitution and laws made available.

CHICAGO&para;<br>Opinion of THOMAS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>right: the assurance that they would be afforded the&para;<br>“privileges and immunities” of citizenship in any of the&para;<br>several States in the Union to which they might travel.&para;<br>What were the “Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in&para;<br>the several States”? That question was answered perhaps&para;<br>most famously by Justice Bushrod Washington sitting as&para;<br>Circuit Justice in Corfield v. Coryell, 6 F. Cas. 546,&para;<br>551−552 (No. 3,230) (CC ED Pa. 1825). In that case, a&para;<br>Pennsylvania citizen claimed that a New Jersey law pro&para;<br>hibiting nonresidents from harvesting oysters from the&para;<br>State’s waters violated Article IV, §2 because it deprived&para;<br>him, as an out-of-state citizen, of a right New Jersey&para;<br>availed to its own citizens. Id., at 550. Justice Washing&para;<br>ton rejected that argument, refusing to “accede to the&para;<br>proposition” that Article IV, §2 entitled “citizens of the&para;<br>several states . . . to participate in all the rights which&para;<br>belong exclusively to the citizens of any other particular&para;<br>state.” Id., at 552 (emphasis added). In his view, Article&para;<br>IV, §2 did not guarantee equal access to all public benefits&para;<br>a State might choose to make available to its citizens. See&para;<br>id., at 552. Instead, it applied only to those rights “which&para;<br>are, in their nature, fundamental; which belong, of right,&para;<br>to the citizens of all free governments.” Id., at 551 (em&para;<br>phasis added). Other courts generally agreed with this&para;<br>principle. See, e.g., Abbott v. Bayley, 23 Mass. 89, 92–93&para;<br>(1827) (noting that the “privileges and immunities” of&para;<br>citizens in the several States protected by Article IV, §2&para;<br>are “qualified and not absolute” because they do not grant&para;<br>a traveling citizen the right of “suffrage or of eligibility to&para;<br>office” in the State to which he travels).&para;<br>When describing those “fundamental” rights, Justice&para;<br>Washington thought it “would perhaps be more tedious&para;<br>than difficult to enumerate” them all, but suggested that&para;<br>they could “be all comprehended under” a broad list of&para;<br>“general heads,” such as “[p]rotection by the government,”&para;<br>“the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right to acquire&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

On this question, the weight of&para;<br>legal authorities at the time of Reconstruction indicated&para;<br>that Article IV, §2 prohibited States from discriminating&para;<br>against sojourning citizens when recognizing fundamental&para;<br>rights, but did not require States to recognize those rights&para;<br>and did not prescribe their content. The highest courts of&para;<br>several States adopted this view, see, e.g., Livingston v.&para;<br>Van Ingen, 9 Johns. 507, 561 (N. Y. Sup.

As the Court demonstrates, there&para;<br>can be no doubt that §1 was understood to enforce the&para;<br>Second Amendment against the States. See ante, at 22–&para;<br>33. In my view, this is because the right to keep and bear&para;<br>arms was understood to be a privilege of American citizen&para;<br>ship guaranteed by the Privileges or Immunities Clause.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

The municipal re&para;<br>spondents, Chicago and Oak Park, argue for the former&para;<br>interpretation. They contend that the Second Amend&para;<br>ment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth,&para;<br>authorizes a State to impose an outright ban on handgun&para;<br>possession such as the ones at issue here so long as a State&para;<br>applies it to all citizens equally.15 The Court explains why&para;<br>this antidiscrimination-only reading of §1 as a whole is&para;<br>“implausible.” Ante, at 31 (citing Brief for Municipal&para;<br>Respondents 64). I agree, but because I think it is the&para;<br>Privileges or Immunities Clause that applies this right to&para;<br>the States, I must explain why this Clause in particular&para;<br>protects against more than just state discrimination, and&para;<br>in fact establishes a minimum baseline of rights for all&para;<br>American citizens.&para;<br>1&para;<br>I begin, again, with the text. The Privileges or Immuni&para;<br>ties Clause opens with the command that “No State shall”&para;<br>abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>15 The municipal respondents and JUSTICE BREYER’s dissent raise a&para;<br>most unusual argument that §1 prohibits discriminatory laws affecting&para;<br>only the right to keep and bear arms, but offers substantive protection&para;<br>to other rights enumerated in the Constitution, such as the freedom of&para;<br>speech. See post, at 24. Others, however, have made the more compre&para;<br>hensive—and internally consistent—argument that §1 bars discrimina&para;<br>tion alone and does not afford protection to any substantive rights. See,&para;<br>e.g., R. Berger, Government By Judiciary: The Transformation of the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment (1997). I address the coverage of the Privi&para;<br>leges or Immunities Clause only as it applies to the Second Amendment&para;<br>right presented here, but I do so with the understanding that my&para;<br>conclusion may have implications for the broader argument.&para;<br>&para;<br>36&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Opinion of THOMAS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>United States. Amdt. 14, §1 (emphasis added). The very&para;<br>same phrase opens Article I, §10 of the Constitution,&para;<br>which prohibits the States from “pass[ing] any Bill of&para;<br>Attainder” or “ex post facto Law,” among other things.&para;<br>Article I, §10 is one of the few constitutional provisions&para;<br>that limits state authority. In Barron, when Chief Justice&para;<br>Marshall interpreted the Bill of Rights as lacking “plain&para;<br>and intelligible language” restricting state power to in&para;<br>fringe upon individual liberties, he pointed to Article I, §10&para;<br>as an example of text that would have accomplished that&para;<br>task. 7 Pet., at 250. Indeed, Chief Justice Marshall would&para;<br>later describe Article I, §10 as “a bill of rights for the&para;<br>people of each state.” Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 138&para;<br>(1810). Thus, the fact that the Privileges or Immunities&para;<br>Clause uses the command “[n]o State shall”—which Arti&para;<br>cle IV, §2 does not—strongly suggests that the former&para;<br>imposes a greater restriction on state power than the&para;<br>latter.&para;<br>This interpretation is strengthened when one considers&para;<br>that the Privileges or Immunities Clause uses the verb&para;<br>“abridge,” rather than “discriminate,” to describe the limit&para;<br>it imposes on state authority. The Webster’s dictionary in&para;<br>use at the time of Reconstruction defines the word&para;<br>“abridge” to mean “[t]o deprive; to cut off; . . . as, to&para;<br>abridge one of his rights.” Webster, An American Diction&para;<br>ary of the English Language, at 6. The Clause is thus best&para;<br>understood to impose a limitation on state power to in&para;<br>fringe upon pre-existing substantive rights. It raises no&para;<br>indication that the Framers of the Clause used the word&para;<br>“abridge” to prohibit only discrimination.&para;<br>This most natural textual reading is underscored by a&para;<br>well-publicized revision to the Fourteenth Amendment&para;<br>that the Reconstruction Congress rejected. After several&para;<br>Southern States refused to ratify the Amendment, Presi&para;<br>dent Johnson met with their Governors to draft a com&para;<br>promise. N. Y. Times, Feb. 5, 1867, p. 5.

See supra, at 15–18. The proposal thus strongly&para;<br>indicates that at least the President of the United States&para;<br>and several southern Governors thought that the Privi&para;<br>leges or Immunities Clause, which they unsuccessfully&para;<br>tried to revise, prohibited more than just state-sponsored&para;<br>discrimination.&para;<br>2&para;<br>The argument that the Privileges or Immunities Clause&para;<br>prohibits no more than discrimination often is followed by&para;<br>a claim that public discussion of the Clause, and of §1&para;<br>generally, was not extensive. Because of this, the argu&para;<br>ment goes, §1 must not have been understood to accom&para;<br>plish such a significant task as subjecting States to federal&para;<br>enforcement of a minimum baseline of rights.

These facts are not surprising.&para;<br>First, however consequential we consider the question&para;<br>today, the nationalization of constitutional rights was not&para;<br>the most controversial aspect of the Fourteenth Amend&para;<br>ment at the time of its ratification. The Nation had just&para;<br>endured a tumultuous civil war, and §§2, 3, and 4—which&para;<br>reduced the representation of States that denied voting&para;<br>rights to blacks, deprived most former Confederate officers&para;<br>of the power to hold elective office, and required States to&para;<br>disavow Confederate war debts—were far more polarizing&para;<br>and consumed far more political attention.

Rev. 695, 699 (2009).&para;<br>Second, the congressional debates on the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment reveal that many representatives, and proba&para;<br>bly many citizens, believed that the Thirteenth Amend&para;<br>ment, the 1866 Civil Rights legislation, or some combina&para;<br>tion of the two, had already enforced constitutional rights&para;<br>against the States. Justice Black’s dissent in Adamson&para;<br>chronicles this point in detail. 332 U. S., at 107–108&para;<br>(Appendix to dissenting opinion). Regardless of whether&para;<br>that understanding was accurate as a matter of constitu&para;<br>tional law, it helps to explain why Congressmen had little&para;<br>to say during the debates about §1.

Like the Framers, see supra, at 14–15, many 19th&para;<br>century Americans understood the Bill of Rights to declare&para;<br>inalienable rights that pre-existed all government. Thus,&para;<br>even though the Bill of Rights technically applied only to&para;<br>the Federal Government, many believed that it declared&para;<br>rights that no legitimate government could abridge.&para;<br>Chief Justice Henry Lumpkin’s decision for the Georgia&para;<br>Supreme Court in Nunn v. State, 1 Ga. 243 (1846), illus&para;<br>trates this view. In assessing state power to regulate&para;<br>firearm possession, Lumpkin wrote that he was “aware&para;<br>that it has been decided, that [the Second Amendment],&para;<br>like other amendments adopted at the same time, is a&para;<br>restriction upon the government of the United States, and&para;<br>does not extend to the individual States.” Id., at 250. But&para;<br>he still considered the right to keep and bear arms as “an&para;<br>unalienable right, which lies at the bottom of every free&para;<br>government,” and thus found the States bound to honor it.&para;<br>Ibid. Other state courts adopted similar positions with&para;<br>respect to the right to keep and bear arms and other enu&para;<br>merated rights.16 Some courts even suggested that the&para;<br>protections in the Bill of Rights were legally enforceable&para;<br>against the States, Barron notwithstanding.17 A promi&para;<br>nent treatise of the era took the same position.

Vir&para;<br>ginia made it a crime for a member of an “abolition” soci&para;<br>ety to enter the State and argue “that the owners of slaves&para;<br>have no property in the same, or advocate or advise the&para;<br>abolition of slavery.” 1835–1836 Va.

I must,&para;<br>therefore, consider whether stare decisis requires reten&para;<br>tion of those precedents. As mentioned at the outset, my&para;<br>inquiry is limited to the right at issue here. Thus, I do not&para;<br>endeavor to decide in this case whether, or to what extent,&para;<br>the Privileges or Immunities Clause applies any other&para;<br>rights enumerated in the Constitution against the&para;<br>States.20 Nor do I suggest that the stare decisis considera&para;<br>tions surrounding the application of the right to keep and&para;<br>bear arms against the States would be the same as those&para;<br>surrounding another right protected by the Privileges or&para;<br>Immunities Clause. I consider stare decisis only as it&para;<br>applies to the question presented here.&para;<br>A&para;<br>This inquiry begins with the Slaughter-House Cases.&para;<br>There, this Court upheld a Louisiana statute granting a&para;<br>monopoly on livestock butchering in and around the city of&para;<br>New Orleans to a newly incorporated company. 16 Wall.&para;<br>36. Butchers excluded by the monopoly sued, claiming&para;<br>that the statute violated the Privileges or Immunities&para;<br>Clause because it interfered with their right to pursue and&para;<br>“exercise their trade.” Id., at 60. This Court rejected the&para;<br>butchers’ claim, holding that their asserted right was not a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>20 I&para;<br>&para;<br>note, however, that I see no reason to assume that the constitu&para;<br>tionally enumerated rights protected by the Privileges or Immunities&para;<br>Clause should consist of all the rights recognized in the Bill of Rights&para;<br>and no others. Constitutional provisions outside the Bill of Rights&para;<br>protect individual rights, see, e.g., Art. I, §9, cl. 2 (granting the “Privi&para;<br>lege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus”), and there is no obvious evidence&para;<br>that the Framers of the Privileges or Immunities Clause meant to&para;<br>exclude them. In addition, certain Bill of Rights provisions prevent&para;<br>federal interference in state affairs and are not readily construed as&para;<br>protecting rights that belong to individuals. The Ninth and Tenth&para;<br>Amendments are obvious examples, as is the First Amendment’s&para;<br>Establishment Clause, which “does not purport to protect individual&para;<br>rights.” Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 50&para;<br>(2004) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); see Amar 179–180.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

The Court held that the&para;<br>Privileges or Immunities Clause protected only rights of&para;<br>federal citizenship—those “which owe their existence to&para;<br>the Federal government, its National character, its Con&para;<br>stitution, or its laws,” id., at 79—and did not protect any&para;<br>of the rights of state citizenship, id., at 74. In other&para;<br>words, the Court defined the two sets of rights as mutually&para;<br>exclusive.&para;<br>After separating these two sets of rights, the Court&para;<br>defined the rights of state citizenship as “embrac[ing]&para;<br>nearly every civil right for the establishment and protec&para;<br>tion of which organized government is instituted”—that is,&para;<br>all those rights listed in Corfield. 16 Wall., at 76 (refer&para;<br>ring to “those rights” that “Judge Washington” described).&para;<br>That left very few rights of federal citizenship for the&para;<br>Privileges or Immunities Clause to protect. The Court&para;<br>suggested a handful of possibilities, such as the “right of&para;<br>free access to [federal] seaports,” protection of the Federal&para;<br>Government while traveling “on the high seas,” and even&para;<br>two rights listed in the Constitution. Id., at 79 (noting&para;<br>“[t]he right to peaceably assemble” and “the privilege of&para;<br>the writ of habeas corpus”); see supra, at 4. But its deci&para;<br>sion to interpret the rights of state and federal citizenship&para;<br>as mutually exclusive led the Court in future cases to&para;<br>conclude that constitutionally enumerated rights were&para;<br>excluded from the Privileges or Immunities Clause’s scope.&para;<br>See Cruikshank, supra.&para;<br>I reject that understanding. There was no reason to&para;<br>interpret the Privileges or Immunities Clause as putting&para;<br>the Court to the extreme choice of interpreting the “privi&para;<br>leges and immunities” of federal citizenship to mean ei&para;<br>ther all those rights listed in Corfield, or almost no rights&para;<br>at all. 16 Wall., at 76. The record is scant that the public&para;<br>understood the Clause to make the Federal Government&para;<br>“a perpetual censor upon all legislation of the States” as&para;<br>&para;<br>50&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>Opinion of THOMAS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>the Slaughter-House majority feared. Id., at 78. For one&para;<br>thing, Corfield listed the “elective franchise” as one of the&para;<br>privileges and immunities of “citizens of the several&para;<br>states,” 6 F. Cas., at 552, yet Congress and the States still&para;<br>found it necessary to adopt the Fifteenth Amendment—&para;<br>which protects “[t]he right of citizens of the United States&para;<br>to vote”—two years after the Fourteenth Amendment’s&para;<br>passage. If the Privileges or Immunities Clause were&para;<br>understood to protect every conceivable civil right from&para;<br>state abridgment, the Fifteenth Amendment would have&para;<br>been redundant.&para;<br>The better view, in light of the States and Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment’s shared history of recognizing certain inalienable&para;<br>rights in their citizens, is that the privileges and immuni&para;<br>ties of state and federal citizenship overlap. This is not to&para;<br>say that the privileges and immunities of state and federal&para;<br>citizenship are the same. At the time of the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment’s ratification, States performed many more&para;<br>functions than the Federal Government, and it is unlikely&para;<br>that, simply by referring to “privileges or immunities,” the&para;<br>Framers of §1 meant to transfer every right mentioned in&para;<br>Corfield to congressional oversight. As discussed, “privi&para;<br>leges” and “immunities” were understood only as syno&para;<br>nyms for “rights.” See supra, at 9–11. It was their at&para;<br>tachment to a particular group that gave them content,&para;<br>and the text and history recounted here indicate that the&para;<br>rights of United States citizens were not perfectly identi&para;<br>cal to the rights of citizens “in the several States.” Justice&para;<br>Swayne, one of the dissenters in Slaughter-House, made&para;<br>the point clear:&para;<br>“The citizen of a State has the same fundamental&para;<br>rights as a citizen of the United States, and also cer&para;<br>tain others, local in their character, arising from his&para;<br>relation to the State, and in addition, those which be&para;<br>long to the citizen of the United States, he being in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

There may thus be a double citi&para;<br>zenship, each having some rights peculiar to itself. It&para;<br>is only over those which belong to the citizen of the&para;<br>United States that the category here in question&para;<br>throws the shield of its protection.” 16 Wall., at 126&para;<br>(emphasis added).&para;<br>Because the privileges and immunities of American citi&para;<br>zenship include rights enumerated in the Constitution,&para;<br>they overlap to at least some extent with the privileges&para;<br>and immunities traditionally recognized in citizens in the&para;<br>several States.&para;<br>A separate question is whether the privileges and im&para;<br>munities of American citizenship include any rights be&para;<br>sides those enumerated in the Constitution. The four&para;<br>dissenting Justices in Slaughter-House would have held&para;<br>that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected the&para;<br>unenumerated right that the butchers in that case as&para;<br>serted. See id., at 83 (Field, J., dissenting); id., at 111&para;<br>(Bradley, J., dissenting); id., at 124 (Swayne, J., dissent&para;<br>ing). Because this case does not involve an unenumerated&para;<br>right, it is not necessary to resolve the question whether&para;<br>the Clause protects such rights, or whether the Court’s&para;<br>judgment in Slaughter-House was correct.&para;<br>Still, it is argued that the mere possibility that the&para;<br>Privileges or Immunities Clause may enforce unenumer&para;<br>ated rights against the States creates “ ‘special hazards’ ”&para;<br>that should prevent this Court from returning to the&para;<br>original meaning of the Clause.21 Post, at 3 (STEVENS, J.,&para;<br>dissenting). Ironically, the same objection applies to the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>21 To the extent JUSTICE STEVENS is concerned that reliance on the&para;<br>Privileges or Immunities Clause may invite judges to “write their&para;<br>personal views of appropriate public policy into the Constitution,” post,&para;<br>at 3 (internal quotation marks omitted), his celebration of the alterna&para;<br>tive—the “flexibility,” “transcend[ence],” and “dynamism” of substan&para;<br>tive due process—speaks for itself, post, at 14–15, 20.&para;<br>&para;<br>52&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v.

But I see no reason to&para;<br>assume that such hazards apply to the Privileges or Im&para;<br>munities Clause. The mere fact that the Clause does not&para;<br>expressly list the rights it protects does not render it&para;<br>incapable of principled judicial application. The Constitu&para;<br>tion contains many provisions that require an examination&para;<br>of more than just constitutional text to determine whether&para;<br>a particular act is within Congress’ power or is otherwise&para;<br>prohibited. See, e.g., Art. I, §8, cl. 18 (Necessary and&para;<br>Proper Clause); Amdt. 8 (Cruel and Unusual Punishments&para;<br>Clause). When the inquiry focuses on what the ratifying&para;<br>era understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to&para;<br>mean, interpreting it should be no more “hazardous” than&para;<br>interpreting these other constitutional provisions by using&para;<br>the same approach. To be sure, interpreting the Privileges&para;<br>or Immunities Clause may produce hard questions. But&para;<br>they will have the advantage of being questions the Con&para;<br>stitution asks us to answer. I believe those questions are&para;<br>more worthy of this Court’s attention—and far more likely&para;<br>to yield discernable answers—than the substantive due&para;<br>process questions the Court has for years created on its&para;<br>own, with neither textual nor historical support.&para;<br>Finding these impediments to returning to the original&para;<br>meaning overstated, I reject Slaughter-House insofar as it&para;<br>precludes any overlap between the privileges and immuni&para;<br>ties of state and federal citizenship. I next proceed to the&para;<br>stare decisis considerations surrounding the precedent&para;<br>that expressly controls the question presented here.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Three years after Slaughter-House, the Court in Cruik&para;<br>shank squarely held that the right to keep and bear arms&para;<br>was not a privilege of American citizenship, thereby over&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

See supra, at 4–5. Cruik&para;<br>shank is not a precedent entitled to any respect. The flaws&para;<br>in its interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities&para;<br>Clause are made evident by the preceding evidence of its&para;<br>original meaning, and I would reject the holding on that&para;<br>basis alone. But, the consequences of Cruikshank warrant&para;<br>mention as well.&para;<br>Cruikshank’s holding that blacks could look only to state&para;<br>governments for protection of their right to keep and bear&para;<br>arms enabled private forces, often with the assistance of&para;<br>local governments, to subjugate the newly freed slaves and&para;<br>their descendants through a wave of private violence&para;<br>designed to drive blacks from the voting booth and force&para;<br>them into peonage, an effective return to slavery. Without&para;<br>federal enforcement of the inalienable right to keep and&para;<br>bear arms, these militias and mobs were tragically suc&para;<br>cessful in waging a campaign of terror against the very&para;<br>people the Fourteenth Amendment had just made citizens.&para;<br>Take, for example, the Hamburg Massacre of 1876.&para;<br>There, a white citizen militia sought out and murdered a&para;<br>troop of black militiamen for no other reason than that&para;<br>they had dared to conduct a celebratory Fourth of July&para;<br>parade through their mostly black town.

That principle has little rele­&para;<br>vance to the question whether a nonprocedural rule set&para;<br>forth in the Bill of Rights qualifies as an aspect of the lib­&para;<br>erty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.&para;<br>Notwithstanding some overheated dicta in Malloy, 378&para;<br>U. S., at 10–11, it is therefore an overstatement to say&para;<br>that the Court has “abandoned,” ante, at 16, 17 (majority&para;<br>opinion), 39 (plurality opinion), a “two-track approach to&para;<br>incorporation,” ante, at 37 (plurality opinion). The Court&para;<br>moved away from that approach in the area of criminal&para;<br>procedure. But the Second Amendment differs in funda­&para;<br>mental respects from its neighboring provisions in the Bill&para;<br>of Rights, as I shall explain in Part V, infra; and if some&para;<br>1960’s opinions purported to establish a general method of&para;<br>incorporation, that hardly binds us in this case. The Court&para;<br>has not hesitated to cut back on perceived Warren Court&para;<br>excesses in more areas than I can count.&para;<br>I do not mean to deny that there can be significant&para;<br>practical, as well as esthetic, benefits from treating rights&para;<br>symmetrically with regard to the State and Federal Gov­&para;<br>ernments. Jot-for-jot incorporation of a provision may&para;<br>entail greater protection of the right at issue and therefore&para;<br>greater freedom for those who hold it; jot-for-jot incorpora­&para;<br>tion may also yield greater clarity about the contours of&para;<br>the legal rule.

When one legal standard must&para;<br>prevail across dozens of jurisdictions with disparate needs&para;<br>and customs, courts will often settle on a relaxed stan­&para;<br>dard. This watering-down risk is particularly acute when&para;<br>we move beyond the narrow realm of criminal procedure&para;<br>and into the relatively vast domain of substantive rights.&para;<br>So long as the requirements of fundamental fairness are&para;<br>always and everywhere respected, it is not clear that&para;<br>greater liberty results from the jot-for-jot application of a&para;<br>provision of the Bill of Rights to the States. Indeed, it is&para;<br>far from clear that proponents of an individual right to&para;<br>keep and bear arms ought to celebrate today’s decision.13&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 The vast majority of States already recognize a right to keep and&para;<br>bear arms in their own constitutions, see Volokh, State Constitutional&para;<br>Rights to Keep and Bear Arms, 11 Tex.

Whether conceptualized&para;<br>as a “rational continuum” of legal precepts, Poe, 367 U.

We have never applied Palko in such a draco­&para;<br>nian manner.&para;<br>Nor, as the Court intimates, see ante, at 16, did Duncan&para;<br>mark an irreparable break from Palko, swapping out&para;<br>liberty for history. Duncan limited its discussion to “par­&para;<br>ticular procedural safeguard[s]” in the Bill of Rights relat­&para;<br>ing to “criminal processes,” 391 U.

Duncan, 391&para;<br>U. S., at 149–150, n. 14. Several of our most important&para;<br>recent decisions confirm the proposition that substantive&para;<br>due process analysis—from which, once again, “incorpora­&para;<br>tion” analysis derives—must not be wholly backward&para;<br>looking. See, e.g., Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.

The Court hinges its entire&para;<br>decision on one mode of intellectual history, culling se­&para;<br>lected pronouncements and enactments from the 18th and&para;<br>19th centuries to ascertain what Americans thought about&para;<br>firearms. Relying on Duncan and Glucksberg, the plural­&para;<br>ity suggests that only interests that have proved “funda­&para;<br>mental from an American perspective,” ante, at 37, 44, or&para;<br>“ ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,’ ”&para;<br>ante, at 19 (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721), to the&para;<br>Court’s satisfaction, may qualify for incorporation into the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment. To the extent the Court’s opin­&para;<br>ion could be read to imply that the historical pedigree of a&para;<br>right is the exclusive or dispositive determinant of its&para;<br>status under the Due Process Clause, the opinion is seri­&para;<br>ously mistaken.&para;<br>A rigid historical test is inappropriate in this case, most&para;<br>basically, because our substantive due process doctrine&para;<br>has never evaluated substantive rights in purely, or even&para;<br>predominantly, historical terms. When the Court applied&para;<br>many of the procedural guarantees in the Bill of Rights to&para;<br>the States in the 1960’s, it often asked whether the guar­&para;<br>antee in question was “fundamental in the context of the&para;<br>criminal processes maintained by the American States.”17&para;<br>——————&para;<br>16 I&para;<br>&para;<br>acknowledge that some have read the Court’s opinion in Glucks­&para;<br>berg as an attempt to move substantive due process analysis, for all&para;<br>purposes, toward an exclusively historical methodology—and thereby to&para;<br>debilitate the doctrine. If that were ever Glucksberg’s aspiration,&para;<br>Lawrence plainly renounced it. As between Glucksberg and Lawrence, I&para;<br>have little doubt which will prove the more enduring precedent.&para;<br>17 The Court almost never asked whether the guarantee in question&para;<br>was deeply rooted in founding-era practice.

That inquiry could ex­&para;<br>tend back through time, but it was focused not so much on&para;<br>historical conceptions of the guarantee as on its functional&para;<br>significance within the States’ regimes. This contextual­&para;<br>ized approach made sense, as the choice to employ any&para;<br>given trial-type procedure means little in the abstract. It&para;<br>is only by inquiring into how that procedure intermeshes&para;<br>with other procedures and practices in a criminal justice&para;<br>system that its relationship to “liberty” and “due process”&para;<br>can be determined.&para;<br>Yet when the Court has used the Due Process Clause to&para;<br>recognize rights distinct from the trial context—rights&para;<br>relating to the primary conduct of free individuals—&para;<br>Justice Cardozo’s test has been our guide. The right to&para;<br>free speech, for instance, has been safeguarded from state&para;<br>infringement not because the States have always honored&para;<br>it, but because it is “essential to free government” and “to&para;<br>the maintenance of democratic institutions”—that is,&para;<br>because the right to free speech is implicit in the concept&para;<br>of ordered liberty.

In considering&para;<br>such a majestic term as “liberty” and applying it to present&para;<br>circumstances, how are we to do justice to its urgent call&para;<br>and its open texture—and to the grant of interpretive&para;<br>discretion the latter embodies—without injecting excessive&para;<br>subjectivity or unduly restricting the States’ “broad lati­&para;<br>tude in experimenting with possible solutions to problems&para;<br>of vital local concern,” Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 597&para;<br>(1977)? One part of the answer, already discussed, is that&para;<br>we must ground the analysis in historical experience and&para;<br>reasoned judgment, and never on “merely personal and&para;<br>private notions.” Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 170&para;<br>(1952). Our precedents place a number of additional&para;<br>constraints on the decisional process. Although “guide­&para;<br>posts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered&para;<br>area are scarce and open-ended,” Collins v. Harker&para;<br>Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125 (1992), significant guideposts&para;<br>do exist.23&para;<br>——————&para;<br>people throughout our history have thought.” Ibid. Where we part&para;<br>ways is in his view that courts should be guided only by historical&para;<br>considerations.&para;<br>There is, moreover, a tension between JUSTICE SCALIA’s concern that&para;<br>“courts have the last word” on constitutional questions, ante, at 3, n. 2,&para;<br>on the one hand, and his touting of the Constitution’s Article V amend­&para;<br>ment process, ante, at 3, on the other. The American people can of&para;<br>course reverse this Court’s rulings through that same process.&para;<br>23 In assessing concerns about the “open-ended[ness]” of this area of&para;<br>law, Collins, 503 U. S., at 125, one does well to keep in view the malle­&para;<br>ability not only of the Court’s “deeply rooted”/fundamentality standard&para;<br>but also of substantive due process’ constitutional cousin, “equal&para;<br>protection” analysis. Substantive due process is sometimes accused of&para;<br>entailing an insufficiently “restrained methodology.” Glucksberg, 521&para;<br>U. S., at 721. Yet “the word ‘liberty’ in the Due Process Clause seems to&para;<br>provide at least as much meaningful guidance as does the word ‘equal’&para;<br>in the Equal Protection Clause.” Post, The Supreme Court 2002&para;<br>Term—Foreword: Fashioning the Legal Constitution: Culture, Courts,&para;<br>and Law, 117 Harv. L. Rev. 4, 94, n. 440 (2003). And “[i]f the objection&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>The most basic is that we have eschewed attempts to&para;<br>provide any all-purpose, top-down, totalizing theory of&para;<br>“liberty.”24 That project is bound to end in failure or&para;<br>worse. The Framers did not express a clear understand­&para;<br>ing of the term to guide us, and the now-repudiated&para;<br>Lochner line of cases attests to the dangers of judicial&para;<br>overconfidence in using substantive due process to ad­&para;<br>vance a broad theory of the right or the good. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). In its most&para;<br>durable precedents, the Court “has not attempted to define&para;<br>with exactness the liberty . . . guaranteed” by the Four­&para;<br>teenth Amendment. Meyer, 262 U. S., at 399; see also,&para;<br>e.g., Bolling, 347 U. S, at 499. By its very nature, the&para;<br>meaning of liberty cannot be “reduced to any formula; its&para;<br>content cannot be determined by reference to any code.”&para;<br>Poe, 367 U. S., at 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting).&para;<br>Yet while “the ‘liberty’ specially protected by the Four­&para;<br>teenth Amendment” is “perhaps not capable of being fully&para;<br>clarified,” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 722, it is capable of&para;<br>being refined and delimited. We have insisted that only&para;<br>certain types of especially significant personal interests&para;<br>may qualify for especially heightened protection. Ever&para;<br>since “the deviant economic due process cases [were]&para;<br>repudiated,” id., at 761 (Souter, J., concurring in judg­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>is that the text of the [Due Process] Clause warrants providing only&para;<br>protections of process rather than protections of substance,” “it is&para;<br>striking that even those Justices who are most theoretically opposed to&para;<br>substantive due process, like Scalia and Rehnquist, are also nonethe­&para;<br>less enthusiastic about applying the equal protection component of the&para;<br>Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the federal govern­&para;<br>ment.” Ibid. (citing Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200,&para;<br>213–231 (1995)).&para;<br>24 That one eschews a comprehensive theory of liberty does not, pace&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA, mean that one lacks “a coherent theory of the Due&para;<br>Process Clause,” ante, at 5. It means that one lacks the hubris to adopt&para;<br>a rigid, context-independent definition of a constitutional guarantee&para;<br>that was deliberately framed in open-ended terms.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ment), our doctrine has steered away from “laws that&para;<br>touch economic problems, business affairs, or social condi­&para;<br>tions,” Griswold, 381 U. S., at 482, and has instead cen­&para;<br>tered on “matters relating to marriage, procreation, con­&para;<br>traception, family relationships, and child rearing and&para;<br>education,” Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693, 713 (1976).&para;<br>These categories are not exclusive. Government action&para;<br>that shocks the conscience, pointlessly infringes settled&para;<br>expectations, trespasses into sensitive private realms or&para;<br>life choices without adequate justification, perpetrates&para;<br>gross injustice, or simply lacks a rational basis will always&para;<br>be vulnerable to judicial invalidation. Nor does the fact&para;<br>that an asserted right falls within one of these categories&para;<br>end the inquiry. More fundamental rights may receive&para;<br>more robust judicial protection, but the strength of the&para;<br>individual’s liberty interests and the State’s regulatory&para;<br>interests must always be assessed and compared. No&para;<br>right is absolute.&para;<br>Rather than seek a categorical understanding of the&para;<br>liberty clause, our precedents have thus elucidated a&para;<br>conceptual core. The clause safeguards, most basically,&para;<br>“the ability independently to define one’s identity,” Roberts&para;<br>v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 619 (1984), “the&para;<br>individual’s right to make certain unusually important&para;<br>decisions that will affect his own, or his family’s, destiny,”&para;<br>Fitzgerald, 523 F. 2d, at 719, and the right to be respected&para;<br>as a human being. Self-determination, bodily integrity,&para;<br>freedom of conscience, intimate relationships, political&para;<br>equality, dignity and respect—these are the central values&para;<br>we have found implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.&para;<br>Another key constraint on substantive due process&para;<br>analysis is respect for the democratic process. If a particu­&para;<br>lar liberty interest is already being given careful consid­&para;<br>eration in, and subjected to ongoing calibration by, the&para;<br>States, judicial enforcement may not be appropriate.&para;<br>When the Court declined to establish a general right to&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>physician-assisted suicide, for example, it did so in part&para;<br>because “the States [were] currently engaged in serious,&para;<br>thoughtful examinations of physician-assisted suicide and&para;<br>other similar issues,” rendering judicial intervention both&para;<br>less necessary and potentially more disruptive. Glucks­&para;<br>berg, 521 U. S., at 719, 735. Conversely, we have long&para;<br>appreciated that more “searching” judicial review may be&para;<br>justified when the rights of “discrete and insular minori­&para;<br>ties”—groups that may face systematic barriers in the&para;<br>political system—are at stake. United States v. Carolene&para;<br>Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 153, n. 4 (1938). Courts have&para;<br>a “comparative . . . advantage” over the elected branches&para;<br>on a limited, but significant, range of legal matters. Post,&para;<br>at 8.&para;<br>Recognizing a new liberty right is a momentous step. It&para;<br>takes that right, to a considerable extent, “outside the&para;<br>arena of public debate and legislative action.” Glucksberg,&para;<br>521 U. S., at 720. Sometimes that momentous step must&para;<br>be taken; some fundamental aspects of personhood, dig­&para;<br>nity, and the like do not vary from State to State, and&para;<br>demand a baseline level of protection. But sensitivity to&para;<br>the interaction between the intrinsic aspects of liberty and&para;<br>the practical realities of contemporary society provides an&para;<br>important tool for guiding judicial discretion.&para;<br>This sensitivity is an aspect of a deeper principle: the&para;<br>need to approach our work with humility and caution.&para;<br>Because the relevant constitutional language is so “spa­&para;<br>cious,” Duncan, 391 U. S., at 148, I have emphasized that&para;<br>“[t]he doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to&para;<br>exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break&para;<br>new ground in this field.” Collins, 503 U. S., at 125. Many&para;<br>of my colleagues and predecessors have stressed the same&para;<br>point, some with great eloquence. See, e.g., Casey, 505&para;<br>U. S., at 849; Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 502–&para;<br>503 (1977) (plurality opinion); Poe, 367 U. S., at 542–545&para;<br>(Harlan, J., dissenting); Adamson v. California, 332 U. S.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>46, 68 (1947) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). Historical&para;<br>study may discipline as well as enrich the analysis. But&para;<br>the inescapable reality is that no serious theory of Section&para;<br>1 of the Fourteenth Amendment yields clear answers in&para;<br>every case, and “[n]o formula could serve as a substitute,&para;<br>in this area, for judgment and restraint.” Poe, 367 U. S.,&para;<br>at 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting).&para;<br>Several rules of the judicial process help enforce such&para;<br>restraint. In the substantive due process field as in oth­&para;<br>ers, the Court has applied both the doctrine of stare de­&para;<br>cisis—adhering to precedents, respecting reliance inter­&para;<br>ests, prizing stability and order in the law—and the&para;<br>common-law method—taking cases and controversies as&para;<br>they present themselves, proceeding slowly and incremen­&para;<br>tally, building on what came before. This restrained&para;<br>methodology was evident even in the heyday of “incorpora­&para;<br>tion” during the 1960’s. Although it would have been&para;<br>much easier for the Court simply to declare certain&para;<br>Amendments in the Bill of Rights applicable to the States&para;<br>in toto, the Court took care to parse each Amendment into&para;<br>its component guarantees, evaluating them one by one.&para;<br>This piecemeal approach allowed the Court to scrutinize&para;<br>more closely the right at issue in any given dispute, reduc­&para;<br>ing both the risk and the cost of error.&para;<br>Relatedly, rather than evaluate liberty claims on an&para;<br>abstract plane, the Court has “required in substantive­&para;<br>due-process cases a ‘careful description’ of the asserted&para;<br>fundamental liberty interest.” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at&para;<br>721 (quoting Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993);&para;<br>Collins, 503 U. S., at 125; Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of&para;<br>Health, 497 U. S. 261, 277–278 (1990)). And just as we&para;<br>have required such careful description from the litigants,&para;<br>we have required of ourselves that we “focus on the allega­&para;<br>tions in the complaint to determine how petitioner de­&para;<br>scribes the constitutional right at stake.” Collins, 503&para;<br>U.

Rev. 437, 446–448 (1985). This does not mean&para;<br>that we must define the asserted right at the most specific&para;<br>level, thereby sapping it of a universal valence and a&para;<br>moral force it might otherwise have.25 It means, simply,&para;<br>that we must pay close attention to the precise liberty&para;<br>interest the litigants have asked us to vindicate.&para;<br>Our holdings should be similarly tailored. Even if the&para;<br>most expansive formulation of a claim does not qualify for&para;<br>substantive due process recognition, particular compo­&para;<br>nents of the claim might. Just because there may not be a&para;<br>categorical right to physician-assisted suicide, for exam­&para;<br>ple, does not “ ‘foreclose the possibility that an individual&para;<br>plaintiff seeking to hasten her death, or a doctor whose&para;<br>assistance was sought, could prevail in a more particular­&para;<br>ized challenge.’ ” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 735, n. 24&para;<br>(quoting id., at 750 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg­&para;<br>ments)); see also Vacco v. Quill, 521 U.

It has not been. The question,&para;<br>rather, is whether the particular right asserted by peti­&para;<br>tioners applies to the States because of the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment itself, standing on its own bottom. And to&para;<br>answer that question, we need to determine, first, the&para;<br>nature of the right that has been asserted and, second,&para;<br>whether that right is an aspect of Fourteenth Amendment&para;<br>“liberty.” Even accepting the Court’s holding in Heller, it&para;<br>remains entirely possible that the right to keep and bear&para;<br>arms identified in that opinion is not judicially enforceable&para;<br>against the States, or that only part of the right is so&para;<br>enforceable.26 It is likewise possible for the Court to find&para;<br>——————&para;<br>26 In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.

Cf. post, at 8. I do not understand petitioners or any of&para;<br>their amici to dispute this point. Yet even if Heller had never been&para;<br>decided—indeed, even if the Second Amendment did not exist—we&para;<br>would still have an obligation to address petitioners’ Fourteenth&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v.

The city of Chicago allows resi­&para;<br>dents to keep functional firearms, so long as they are&para;<br>registered, but it generally prohibits the possession of&para;<br>handguns, sawed-off shotguns, machine guns, and short­&para;<br>barreled rifles. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code §8–20–&para;<br>050 (2009).27 Petitioners’ complaint centered on their&para;<br>desire to keep a handgun at their domicile—it references&para;<br>the “home” in nearly every paragraph, see Complaint ¶¶3–&para;<br>4, 11–30, 32, 34, 37, 42, 44, 46, App. 17, 19–26—as did&para;<br>their supporting declarations, see, e.g., App. 34, 36, 40, 43,&para;<br>49–52, 54–56.

But the&para;<br>Heller plaintiff sought only dispensation to keep an oper­&para;<br>able firearm in his home for lawful self-defense, see id., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 2, and n. 2), and the Court’s opinion was&para;<br>bookended by reminders that its holding was limited to&para;<br>that one issue, id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 1, 64); accord,&para;<br>ante, at 44 (plurality opinion). The distinction between&para;<br>the liberty right these petitioners have asserted and the&para;<br>Second Amendment right identified in Heller is therefore&para;<br>evanescent. Both are rooted to the home. Moreover, even&para;<br>if both rights have the logical potential to extend further,&para;<br>upon “future evaluation,” Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 63), it is incumbent upon us, as federal judges contem­&para;<br>plating a novel rule that would bind all 50 States, to pro­&para;<br>ceed cautiously and to decide only what must be decided.&para;<br>Understood as a plea to keep their preferred type of&para;<br>firearm in the home, petitioners’ argument has real&para;<br>force.28 The decision to keep a loaded handgun in the&para;<br>house is often motivated by the desire to protect life, lib­&para;<br>erty, and property. It is comparable, in some ways, to&para;<br>decisions about the education and upbringing of one’s&para;<br>children. For it is the kind of decision that may have&para;<br>profound consequences for every member of the family,&para;<br>and for the world beyond. In considering whether to keep&para;<br>a handgun, heads of households must ask themselves&para;<br>whether the desired safety benefits outweigh the risks of&para;<br>deliberate or accidental misuse that may result in death or&para;<br>serious injury, not only to residents of the home but to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>28 To the extent that petitioners contend the city of Chicago’s registra­&para;<br>tion requirements for firearm possessors also, and separately, violate&para;<br>the Constitution, that claim borders on the frivolous. Petitioners make&para;<br>no effort to demonstrate that the requirements are unreasonable or&para;<br>that they impose a severe burden on the underlying right they have&para;<br>asserted.&para;<br>&para;<br>30&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>others as well. Millions of Americans have answered this&para;<br>question in the affirmative, not infrequently because they&para;<br>believe they have an inalienable right to do so—because&para;<br>they consider it an aspect of “the supreme human dignity&para;<br>of being master of one’s fate rather than a ward of the&para;<br>State,” Indiana v. Edwards, 554 U. S. 164, 186 (2008)&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., dissenting). Many such decisions have been&para;<br>based, in part, on family traditions and deeply held beliefs&para;<br>that are an aspect of individual autonomy the government&para;<br>may not control.29&para;<br>Bolstering petitioners’ claim, our law has long recog­&para;<br>nized that the home provides a kind of special sanctuary&para;<br>in modern life. See, e.g., U. S. Const., Amdts. 3, 4; Law­&para;<br>rence, 539 U. S., at 562, 567; Payton v. New York, 445&para;<br>U. S. 573, 585–590 (1980); Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S.&para;<br>557, 565–568 (1969); Griswold, 381 U. S., at 484–485.&para;<br>Consequently, we have long accorded special deference to&para;<br>the privacy of the home, whether a humble cottage or a&para;<br>magnificent manse. This veneration of the domestic hark­&para;<br>ens back to the common law. William Blackstone recog­&para;<br>nized a “right of habitation,” 4 Commentaries *223, and&para;<br>opined that “every man’s house is looked upon by the law&para;<br>to be his castle of defence and asylum,” 3 id., at *288.&para;<br>Heller carried forward this legacy, observing that “the&para;<br>need for defense of self, family, and property is most&para;<br>acute” in one’s abode, and celebrating “the right of law­&para;<br>abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of&para;<br>hearth and home.” 554 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 56,&para;<br>63).&para;<br>While the individual’s interest in firearm possession is&para;<br>thus heightened in the home, the State’s corresponding&para;<br>interest in regulation is somewhat weaker.

The historical case for&para;<br>regulation is likewise stronger outside the home, as many&para;<br>States have for many years imposed stricter, and less&para;<br>controversial, restrictions on the carriage of arms than on&para;<br>their domestic possession. See, e.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>54) (noting that “the majority of the 19th-century courts to&para;<br>consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying&para;<br>concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amend­&para;<br>ment or state analogues”); English v. State, 35 Tex. 473,&para;<br>478–479 (1871) (observing that “almost, if not every one of&para;<br>the States of this Union have [a prohibition on the carry­&para;<br>ing of deadly weapons] upon their statute books,” and&para;<br>lambasting claims of a right to carry such weapons as&para;<br>“little short of ridiculous”); Miller, Guns as Smut: Defend­&para;<br>ing the Home-Bound Second Amendment, 109 Colum.&para;<br>L. Rev. 1278, 1321–1336 (2009).&para;<br>It is significant, as well, that a rule limiting the federal&para;<br>constitutional right to keep and bear arms to the home&para;<br>would be less intrusive on state prerogatives and easier to&para;<br>administer. Having unleashed in Heller a tsunami of legal&para;<br>uncertainty, and thus litigation,30 and now on the cusp of&para;<br>imposing a national rule on the States in this area for the&para;<br>first time in United States history, the Court could at least&para;<br>moderate the confusion, upheaval, and burden on the&para;<br>States by adopting a rule that is clearly and tightly&para;<br>——————&para;<br>30 See&para;<br>&para;<br>Municipal Respondents’ Brief 20, n. 11 (stating that at least&para;<br>156 Second Amendment challenges were brought in time between&para;<br>Heller’s issuance and brief’s filing); Brady Center Brief 3 (stating that&para;<br>over 190 Second Amendment challenges were brought in first 18&para;<br>months since Heller); Brief for Villages of Winnetka and Skokie, Illi­&para;<br>nois, et al. as Amici Curiae 15 (stating that, in wake of Heller, munici­&para;<br>palities have “repealed longstanding handgun laws to avoid costly&para;<br>litigation”).&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v.

S.,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 56). And it is true that if a State were&para;<br>to try to deprive its residents of any reasonable means of&para;<br>defending themselves from imminent physical threats, or&para;<br>to deny persons any ability to assert self-defense in re­&para;<br>sponse to criminal prosecution, that might pose a signifi­&para;<br>cant constitutional problem. The argument that there is a&para;<br>substantive due process right to be spared such untenable&para;<br>dilemmas is a serious one.32&para;<br>——————&para;<br>31 See,&para;<br>&para;<br>e.g., Brief for Professors of Philosophy, Criminology, Law, and&para;<br>Other Fields as Amici Curiae; Brief for International Law Enforcement&para;<br>Educators and Trainers Association et al. as Amici Curiae 29–45; Brief&para;<br>for 34 California District Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 12–31.&para;<br>32 The argument that this Court should establish any such right,&para;<br>however, faces steep hurdles. All 50 States already recognize self­&para;<br>defense as a defense to criminal prosecution, see 2 P. Robinson, Crimi­&para;<br>nal Law Defenses §132, p. 96 (1984 and Supp. 2009), so this is hardly&para;<br>an interest to which the democratic process has been insensitive. And&para;<br>the States have always diverged on how exactly to implement this&para;<br>interest, so there is wide variety across the Nation in the types and&para;<br>amounts of force that may be used, the necessity of retreat, the rights of&para;<br>aggressors, the availability of the “castle doctrine,” and so forth. See&para;<br>Brief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for Handgun Control as Amicus&para;<br>Curiae 9–21; Brief for American Cities et al. as Amici Curiae 17–19; 2&para;<br>W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law §10.4, pp. 142–160 (2d ed. 2003).&para;<br>Such variation is presumed to be a healthy part of our federalist&para;<br>system, as the States and localities select different rules in light of&para;<br>different priorities, customs, and conditions.&para;<br>As a historical and theoretical matter, moreover, the legal status of&para;<br>self-defense is far more complicated than it might first appear. We&para;<br>have generally understood Fourteenth Amendment “liberty” as some­&para;<br>thing one holds against direct state interference, whereas a personal&para;<br>right of self-defense runs primarily against other individuals; absent&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>33&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>But that is not the case before us. Petitioners have not&para;<br>asked that we establish a constitutional right to individual&para;<br>self-defense; neither their pleadings in the District Court&para;<br>nor their filings in this Court make any such request. Nor&para;<br>do petitioners contend that the city of Chicago—which,&para;<br>recall, allows its residents to keep most rifles and shot­&para;<br>guns, and to keep them loaded—has unduly burdened any&para;<br>such right. What petitioners have asked is that we “incor­&para;<br>porate” the Second Amendment and thereby establish a&para;<br>constitutional entitlement, enforceable against the States,&para;<br>to keep a handgun in the home.&para;<br>Of course, owning a handgun may be useful for practic­&para;<br>ing self-defense. But the right to take a certain type of&para;<br>action is analytically distinct from the right to acquire and&para;<br>utilize specific instrumentalities in furtherance of that&para;<br>action. And while some might favor handguns, it is not&para;<br>——————&para;<br>government tyranny, it is only when the state has failed to interfere&para;<br>with (violent) private conduct that self-help becomes potentially neces­&para;<br>sary. Moreover, it was a basic tenet of founding-era political philosophy&para;<br>that, in entering civil society and gaining “the advantages of mutual&para;<br>commerce” and the protections of the rule of law, one had to relinquish,&para;<br>to a significant degree, “that wild and savage liberty” one possessed in&para;<br>the state of nature. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *125; see also, e.g.,&para;<br>J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government §128, pp. 63–64 (J.&para;<br>Gough ed. 1947) (in state of nature man has power “to do whatever he&para;<br>thinks fit for the preservation of himself and others,” but this “he gives&para;<br>up when he joins in a . . . particular political society”); Green v. Biddle,&para;<br>8 Wheat. 1, 63 (1823) (“It is a trite maxim, that man gives up a part of&para;<br>his natural liberty when he enters into civil society, as the price of the&para;<br>blessings of that state: and it may be said, with truth, that this liberty&para;<br>is well exchanged for the advantages which flow from law and justice”).&para;<br>Some strains of founding-era thought took a very narrow view of the&para;<br>right to armed self-defense. See, e.g., Brief of Historians on Early&para;<br>American Legal, Constitutional, and Pennsylvania History as Amici&para;<br>Curiae 6–13 (discussing Whig and Quaker theories). Just because&para;<br>there may be a natural or common-law right to some measure of self­&para;<br>defense, it hardly follows that States may not place substantial restric­&para;<br>tions on its exercise or that this Court should recognize a constitutional&para;<br>right to the same.&para;<br>&para;<br>34&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>clear that they are a superior weapon for lawful self­&para;<br>defense, and nothing in petitioners’ argument turns on&para;<br>that being the case. The notion that a right of self-defense&para;<br>implies an auxiliary right to own a certain type of firearm&para;<br>presupposes not only controversial judgments about the&para;<br>strength and scope of the (posited) self-defense right, but&para;<br>also controversial assumptions about the likely effects&para;<br>of making that type of firearm more broadly available. It&para;<br>is a very long way from the proposition that the Four­&para;<br>teenth Amendment protects a basic individual right of&para;<br>self-defense to the conclusion that a city may not ban&para;<br>handguns.33&para;<br>In short, while the utility of firearms, and handguns in&para;<br>particular, to the defense of hearth and home is certainly&para;<br>relevant to an assessment of petitioners’ asserted right,&para;<br>there is no freestanding self-defense claim in this case.&para;<br>The question we must decide is whether the interest in&para;<br>keeping in the home a firearm of one’s choosing—a hand­&para;<br>gun, for petitioners—is one that is “comprised within the&para;<br>term liberty” in the Fourteenth Amendment. Whitney, 274&para;<br>U. S., at 373 (Brandeis, J., concurring).&para;<br>——————&para;<br>33 The Second Amendment right identified in Heller is likewise clearly&para;<br>distinct from a right to protect oneself. In my view, the Court badly&para;<br>misconstrued the Second Amendment in linking it to the value of&para;<br>personal self-defense above and beyond the functioning of the state&para;<br>militias; as enacted, the Second Amendment was concerned with&para;<br>tyrants and invaders, and paradigmatically with the federal military,&para;<br>not with criminals and intruders. But even still, the Court made clear&para;<br>that self-defense plays a limited role in determining the scope and&para;<br>substance of the Amendment’s guarantee. The Court struck down the&para;<br>District of Columbia’s handgun ban not because of the utility of hand­&para;<br>guns for lawful self-defense, but rather because of their popularity for&para;<br>that purpose. See 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57–58). And the Court’s&para;<br>common-use gloss on the Second Amendment right, see id., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 55), as well as its discussion of permissible limitations on the&para;<br>right, id., at ___ (slip op., at 54–55), had little to do with self-defense.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>35&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>V&para;<br>While I agree with the Court that our substantive due&para;<br>process cases offer a principled basis for holding that&para;<br>petitioners have a constitutional right to possess a usable&para;<br>fiream in the home, I am ultimately persuaded that a&para;<br>better reading of our case law supports the city of Chicago.&para;<br>I would not foreclose the possibility that a particular&para;<br>plaintiff—say, an elderly widow who lives in a dangerous&para;<br>neighborhood and does not have the strength to operate a&para;<br>long gun—may have a cognizable liberty interest in pos­&para;<br>sessing a handgun. But I cannot accept petitioners’&para;<br>broader submission. A number of factors, taken together,&para;<br>lead me to this conclusion.&para;<br>First, firearms have a fundamentally ambivalent rela­&para;<br>tionship to liberty. Just as they can help homeowners&para;<br>defend their families and property from intruders, they&para;<br>can help thugs and insurrectionists murder innocent&para;<br>victims. The threat that firearms will be misused is far&para;<br>from hypothetical, for gun crime has devastated many of&para;<br>our communities. Amici calculate that approximately one&para;<br>million Americans have been wounded or killed by gunfire&para;<br>in the last decade.34 Urban areas such as Chicago suffer&para;<br>disproportionately from this epidemic of violence. Hand­&para;<br>guns contribute disproportionately to it. Just as some&para;<br>homeowners may prefer handguns because of their small&para;<br>size, light weight, and ease of operation, some criminals&para;<br>will value them for the same reasons. See Heller, 554&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 32–33).&para;<br>In recent years, handguns were reportedly used in more&para;<br>than four-fifths of firearm murders and more than half of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>34 Brady&para;<br>&para;<br>Center Brief 11 (extrapolating from Government statistics);&para;<br>see also Brief for American Public Health Association et al. as Amici&para;<br>Curiae 6–7 (reporting estimated social cost of firearm-related violence&para;<br>of $100 billion per year).&para;<br>&para;<br>36&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>all murders nationwide.35&para;<br>Hence, in evaluating an asserted right to be free from&para;<br>particular gun-control regulations, liberty is on both sides&para;<br>of the equation. Guns may be useful for self-defense, as&para;<br>well as for hunting and sport, but they also have a unique&para;<br>potential to facilitate death and destruction and thereby to&para;<br>destabilize ordered liberty. Your interest in keeping and&para;<br>bearing a certain firearm may diminish my interest in&para;<br>being and feeling safe from armed violence. And while&para;<br>granting you the right to own a handgun might make you&para;<br>safer on any given day—assuming the handgun’s marginal&para;<br>contribution to self-defense outweighs its marginal contri­&para;<br>bution to the risk of accident, suicide, and criminal mis­&para;<br>chief—it may make you and the community you live in&para;<br>less safe overall, owing to the increased number of hand­&para;<br>guns in circulation. It is at least reasonable for a democ­&para;<br>ratically elected legislature to take such concerns into&para;<br>account in considering what sorts of regulations would&para;<br>best serve the public welfare.&para;<br>The practical impact of various gun-control measures&para;<br>may be highly controversial, but this basic insight should&para;<br>not be. The idea that deadly weapons pose a distinctive&para;<br>threat to the social order—and that reasonable restric­&para;<br>tions on their usage therefore impose an acceptable bur­&para;<br>den on one’s personal liberty—is as old as the Republic.&para;<br>As THE CHIEF JUSTICE observed just the other day, it is a&para;<br>foundational premise of modern government that the&para;<br>State holds a monopoly on legitimate violence: “A basic&para;<br>step in organizing a civilized society is to take [the] sword&para;<br>out of private hands and turn it over to an organized&para;<br>government, acting on behalf of all the people.” Robertson&para;<br>——————&para;<br>35 Bogus, Gun Control and America’s Cities: Public Policy and Poli­&para;<br>tics, 1 Albany Govt. L. Rev. 440, 447 (2008) (drawing on FBI data); see&para;<br>also Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18–19) (BREYER, J., dissenting)&para;<br>(providing additional statistics on handgun violence); Municipal Re­&para;<br>spondents’ Brief 13–14 (same).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

The same holds true for the hand­&para;<br>gun. The power a man has in the state of nature “of doing&para;<br>whatsoever he thought fit for the preservation of himself&para;<br>and the rest of mankind, he gives up,” to a significant&para;<br>extent, “to be regulated by laws made by the society.”&para;<br>J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government §129, p. 64&para;<br>(J. Gough ed. 1947).&para;<br>Limiting the federal constitutional right to keep and&para;<br>bear arms to the home complicates the analysis but does&para;<br>not dislodge this conclusion. Even though the Court has&para;<br>long afforded special solicitude for the privacy of the home,&para;<br>we have never understood that principle to “infring[e]&para;<br>upon” the authority of the States to proscribe certain&para;<br>inherently dangerous items, for “[i]n such cases, compel­&para;<br>ling reasons may exist for overriding the right of the indi­&para;<br>vidual to possess those materials.” Stanley, 394 U. S., at&para;<br>568, n. 11. And, of course, guns that start out in the home&para;<br>may not stay in the home. Even if the government has a&para;<br>weaker basis for restricting domestic possession of fire­&para;<br>arms as compared to public carriage—and even if a blan­&para;<br>ket, statewide prohibition on domestic possession might&para;<br>therefore be unconstitutional—the line between the two is&para;<br>a porous one. A state or local legislature may determine&para;<br>that a prophylactic ban on an especially portable weapon&para;<br>is necessary to police that line.&para;<br>Second, the right to possess a firearm of one’s choosing&para;<br>is different in kind from the liberty interests we have&para;<br>recognized under the Due Process Clause. Despite the&para;<br>plethora of substantive due process cases that have been&para;<br>decided in the post-Lochner century, I have found none&para;<br>that holds, states, or even suggests that the term “liberty”&para;<br>encompasses either the common-law right of self-defense&para;<br>or a right to keep and bear arms. I do not doubt for a&para;<br>moment that many Americans feel deeply passionate&para;<br>about firearms, and see them as critical to their way of life&para;<br>&para;<br>38&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>as well as to their security. Nevertheless, it does not&para;<br>appear to be the case that the ability to own a handgun, or&para;<br>any particular type of firearm, is critical to leading a life of&para;<br>autonomy, dignity, or political equality: The marketplace&para;<br>offers many tools for self-defense, even if they are imper­&para;<br>fect substitutes, and neither petitioners nor their amici&para;<br>make such a contention. Petitioners’ claim is not the kind&para;<br>of substantive interest, accordingly, on which a uniform,&para;<br>judicially enforced national standard is presumptively&para;<br>appropriate.36&para;<br>Indeed, in some respects the substantive right at issue&para;<br>may be better viewed as a property right. Petitioners wish&para;<br>to acquire certain types of firearms, or to keep certain&para;<br>firearms they have previously acquired. Interests in the&para;<br>possession of chattels have traditionally been viewed as&para;<br>property interests subject to definition and regulation by&para;<br>the States. Cf. Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v.&para;<br>Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection, 560 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2010) (slip op., at 1) (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (“Gener­&para;<br>ally speaking, state law defines property interests”).&para;<br>——————&para;<br>36 JUSTICE&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA worries that there is no “objective” way to decide&para;<br>what is essential to a “liberty-filled” existence: Better, then, to ignore&para;<br>such messy considerations as how an interest actually affects people’s&para;<br>lives. Ante, at 10. Both the constitutional text and our cases use the&para;<br>term “liberty,” however, and liberty is not a purely objective concept.&para;<br>Substantive due process analysis does not require any “political”&para;<br>judgment, ibid. It does require some amount of practical and norma­&para;<br>tive judgment. The only way to assess what is essential to fulfilling the&para;<br>Constitution’s guarantee of “liberty,” in the present day, is to provide&para;<br>reasons that apply to the present day. I have provided many; JUSTICE&para;<br>SCALIA and the Court have provided virtually none.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA also misstates my argument when he refers to “the&para;<br>right to keep and bear arms,” without qualification. Ante, at 9. That is&para;<br>what the Second Amendment protects against Federal Government&para;<br>infringement. I have taken pains to show why the Fourteenth Amend­&para;<br>ment liberty interest asserted by petitioners—the interest in keeping a&para;<br>firearm of one’s choosing in the home—is not necessarily coextensive&para;<br>with the Second Amendment right.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>39&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Under that tradition, Chicago’s ordinance is unexcep­&para;<br>tional.37&para;<br>The liberty interest asserted by petitioners is also dis­&para;<br>similar from those we have recognized in its capacity to&para;<br>undermine the security of others. To be sure, some of the&para;<br>Bill of Rights’ procedural guarantees may place “restric­&para;<br>tions on law enforcement” that have “controversial public&para;<br>safety implications.” Ante, at 36 (plurality opinion); see&para;<br>also ante, at 9 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). But those implica­&para;<br>tions are generally quite attenuated. A defendant’s invo­&para;<br>cation of his right to remain silent, to confront a witness,&para;<br>or to exclude certain evidence cannot directly cause any&para;<br>threat. The defendant’s liberty interest is constrained by&para;<br>(and is itself a constraint on) the adjudicatory process.&para;<br>The link between handgun ownership and public safety is&para;<br>much tighter. The handgun is itself a tool for crime; the&para;<br>handgun’s bullets are the violence.&para;<br>Similarly, it is undeniable that some may take profound&para;<br>offense at a remark made by the soapbox speaker, the&para;<br>practices of another religion, or a gay couple’s choice to&para;<br>have intimate relations. But that offense is moral, psycho­&para;<br>logical, or theological in nature; the actions taken by the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>37 It has not escaped my attention that the Due Process Clause refers&para;<br>to “property” as well as “liberty.” Cf. ante, at 2, n. 1, 9–10, n. 6 (opinion&para;<br>of SCALIA, J.). Indeed, in Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977)&para;<br>(plurality opinion), I alone viewed “the critical question” as “whether&para;<br>East Cleveland’s housing ordinance [was] a permissible restriction on&para;<br>appellant’s right to use her own property as she sees fit,” id., at 513&para;<br>(opinion concurring in judgment).

Colorful as it is, JUSTICE SCALIA’s&para;<br>critique does not have nearly as much force as does his&para;<br>rhetoric. His theory of substantive due process, moreover,&para;<br>comes with its own profound difficulties.&para;<br>Although JUSTICE SCALIA aspires to an “objective,”&para;<br>“neutral” method of substantive due process analysis,&para;<br>ante, at 10, his actual method is nothing of the sort. Un­&para;<br>der the “historically focused” approach he advocates, ante,&para;<br>at 13, numerous threshold questions arise before one ever&para;<br>gets to the history. At what level of generality should one&para;<br>frame the liberty interest in question? See n. 25, supra.&para;<br>What does it mean for a right to be “ ‘deeply rooted in this&para;<br>Nation’s history and tradition,’ ” ante, at 3 (quoting&para;<br>Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721)? By what standard will&para;<br>that proposition be tested? Which types of sources will&para;<br>count, and how will those sources be weighed and aggre­&para;<br>gated? There is no objective, neutral answer to these&para;<br>questions. There is not even a theory—at least, JUSTICE&para;<br>SCALIA provides none—of how to go about answering&para;<br>them.&para;<br>Nor is there any escaping Palko, it seems. To qualify for&para;<br>substantive due process protection, JUSTICE SCALIA has&para;<br>stated, an asserted liberty right must be not only deeply&para;<br>&para;<br>52&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>rooted in American tradition, “but it must also be implicit&para;<br>in the concept of ordered liberty.” Lawrence, 539 U. S., at&para;<br>593, n. 3 (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). Applying the latter, Palko-derived half of that&para;<br>test requires precisely the sort of reasoned judgment—the&para;<br>same multifaceted evaluation of the right’s contours and&para;<br>consequences—that JUSTICE SCALIA mocks in his concur­&para;<br>rence today.&para;<br>So does applying the first half. It is hardly a novel&para;<br>insight that history is not an objective science, and that its&para;<br>use can therefore “point in any direction the judges favor,”&para;<br>ante, at 14 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Yet 21 years after the&para;<br>point was brought to his attention by Justice Brennan,&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA remains “oblivious to the fact that [the&para;<br>concept of ‘tradition’] can be as malleable and elusive as&para;<br>‘liberty’ itself.” Michael H., 491 U. S., at 137 (dissenting&para;<br>opinion). Even when historical analysis is focused on a&para;<br>discrete proposition, such as the original public meaning of&para;<br>the Second Amendment, the evidence often points in&para;<br>different directions. The historian must choose which&para;<br>pieces to credit and which to discount, and then must try&para;<br>to assemble them into a coherent whole. In Heller,&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA preferred to rely on sources created much&para;<br>earlier and later in time than the Second Amendment&para;<br>itself, see, e.g., 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4–5) (consult­&para;<br>ing late 19th-century treatises to ascertain how Americans&para;<br>would have read the Amendment’s preamble in 1791); I&para;<br>focused more closely on sources contemporaneous with the&para;<br>Amendment’s drafting and ratification.49 No mechanical&para;<br>——————&para;<br>49 See Heller, 554 U.

At least with the former sort&para;<br>of question, the judge can focus on a single legal provision;&para;<br>the temporal scope of the inquiry is (or should be) rela­&para;<br>tively bounded; and there is substantial agreement on&para;<br>what sorts of authorities merit consideration.&para;<br>With&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA’s approach to substantive due process,&para;<br>these guideposts all fall away. The judge must canvas the&para;<br>entire landscape of American law as it has evolved&para;<br>through time, and perhaps older laws as well, see, e.g.,&para;<br>Lawrence, 539 U. S., at 596 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (dis­&para;<br>cussing “ ‘ancient roots’ ” of proscriptions against sodomy&para;<br>(quoting Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186, 192 (1986)),&para;<br>pursuant to a standard (deeply rootedness) that has never&para;<br>been defined. In conducting this rudderless, panoramic&para;<br>tour of American legal history, the judge has more than&para;<br>ample opportunity to “look over the heads of the crowd&para;<br>and pick out [his] friends,” Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S.&para;<br>551, 617 (2005) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).&para;<br>My point is not to criticize judges’ use of history in&para;<br>general or to suggest that it always generates indetermi­&para;<br>nate answers; I have already emphasized that historical&para;<br>study can discipline as well as enrich substantive due&para;<br>process analysis.&para;<br>My point is simply that JUSTICE&para;<br>SCALIA’s defense of his method, which holds out objectivity&para;<br>and restraint as its cardinal—and, it seems, only—virtues,&para;<br>is unsatisfying on its own terms. For a limitless number&para;<br>of subjective judgments may be smuggled into his histori­&para;<br>cal analysis. Worse, they may be buried in the analysis.&para;<br>At least with my approach, the judge’s cards are laid on&para;<br>the table for all to see, and to critique. The judge must&para;<br>&para;<br>54&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>exercise judgment, to be sure. When answering a consti­&para;<br>tutional question to which the text provides no clear an­&para;<br>swer, there is always some amount of discretion; our&para;<br>constitutional system has always depended on judges’&para;<br>filling in the document’s vast open spaces.50 But there is&para;<br>also transparency.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA’s approach is even less restrained in&para;<br>another sense: It would effect a major break from our case&para;<br>law outside of the “incorporation” area. JUSTICE SCALIA&para;<br>does not seem troubled by the fact that his method is&para;<br>largely inconsistent with the Court’s canonical substantive&para;<br>due process decisions, ranging from Meyer, 262 U. S. 390,&para;<br>and Pierce, 268 U. S. 510, in the 1920’s, to Griswold, 381&para;<br>U. S. 479, in the 1960’s, to Lawrence, 539 U. S. 558, in the&para;<br>2000’s. To the contrary, he seems to embrace this disso­&para;<br>nance. My method seeks to synthesize dozens of cases on&para;<br>which the American people have relied for decades.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA’s method seeks to vaporize them. So I am&para;<br>left to wonder, which of us is more faithful to this Nation’s&para;<br>constitutional history? And which of us is more faithful to&para;<br>the values and commitments of the American people, as&para;<br>they stand today? In 1967, when the Court held in Lov­&para;<br>ing, 388 U. S. 1, that adults have a liberty-based as well as&para;<br>equality-based right to wed persons of another race, inter­&para;<br>racial marriage was hardly “deeply rooted” in American&para;<br>tradition. Racial segregation and subordination were&para;<br>deeply rooted. The Court’s substantive due process hold­&para;<br>ing was nonetheless correct—and we should be wary of&para;<br>any interpretive theory that implies, emphatically, that it&para;<br>was not.&para;<br>Which leads me to the final set of points I wish to make:&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA’s method invites not only bad history, but&para;<br>also bad constitutional law. As I have already explained,&para;<br>in evaluating a claimed liberty interest (or any constitu­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>50 Indeed,&para;<br>&para;<br>this is truly one of our most deeply rooted legal traditions.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>55&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tional claim for that matter), it makes perfect sense to give&para;<br>history significant weight: JUSTICE SCALIA’s position is&para;<br>closer to my own than he apparently feels comfortable&para;<br>acknowledging. But it makes little sense to give history&para;<br>dispositive weight in every case. And it makes especially&para;<br>little sense to answer questions like whether the right to&para;<br>bear arms is “fundamental” by focusing only on the past,&para;<br>given that both the practical significance and the public&para;<br>understandings of such a right often change as society&para;<br>changes. What if the evidence had shown that, whereas at&para;<br>one time firearm possession contributed substantially to&para;<br>personal liberty and safety, nowadays it contributes noth­&para;<br>ing, or even tends to undermine them? Would it still have&para;<br>been reasonable to constitutionalize the right?&para;<br>The concern runs still deeper. Not only can historical&para;<br>views be less than completely clear or informative, but&para;<br>they can also be wrong. Some notions that many Ameri­&para;<br>cans deeply believed to be true, at one time, turned out not&para;<br>to be true. Some practices that many Americans believed&para;<br>to be consistent with the Constitution’s guarantees of&para;<br>liberty and equality, at one time, turned out to be incon­&para;<br>sistent with them. The fact that we have a written Con­&para;<br>stitution does not consign this Nation to a static legal&para;<br>existence. Although we should always “pa[y] a decent&para;<br>regard to the opinions of former times,” it “is not the glory&para;<br>of the people of America” to have “suffered a blind venera­&para;<br>tion for antiquity.” The Federalist No. 14, p. 99, 104 (C.&para;<br>Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). It is not the role of federal&para;<br>judges to be amateur historians. And it is not fidelity to&para;<br>the Constitution to ignore its use of deliberately capacious&para;<br>language, in an effort to transform foundational legal&para;<br>commitments into narrow rules of decision.&para;<br>As for “the democratic process,” ante, at 14, 15, a&para;<br>method that looks exclusively to history can easily do more&para;<br>harm than good. Just consider this case. The net result of&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA’s supposedly objective analysis is to vest&para;<br>&para;<br>56&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>federal judges—ultimately a majority of the judges on this&para;<br>Court—with unprecedented lawmaking powers in an area&para;<br>in which they have no special qualifications, and in which&para;<br>the give-and-take of the political process has functioned&para;<br>effectively for decades. Why this “intrudes much less upon&para;<br>the democratic process,” ante, at 14, than an approach&para;<br>that would defer to the democratic process on the regula­&para;<br>tion of firearms is, to say the least, not self-evident. I&para;<br>cannot even tell what, under JUSTICE SCALIA’s view, con­&para;<br>stitutes an “intrusion.”&para;<br>It is worth pondering, furthermore, the vision of democ­&para;<br>racy that underlies JUSTICE SCALIA’s critique. Because&para;<br>very few of us would welcome a system in which majorities&para;<br>or powerful interest groups always get their way. Under&para;<br>our constitutional scheme, I would have thought that a&para;<br>judicial approach to liberty claims such as the one I have&para;<br>outlined—an approach that investigates both the intrinsic&para;<br>nature of the claimed interest and the practical signifi­&para;<br>cance of its judicial enforcement, that is transparent in its&para;<br>reasoning and sincere in its effort to incorporate con­&para;<br>straints, that is guided by history but not beholden to it,&para;<br>and that is willing to protect some rights even if they have&para;<br>not already received uniform protection from the elected&para;<br>branches—has the capacity to improve, rather than&para;<br>“[im]peril,” ante, at 15, our democracy. It all depends on&para;<br>judges’ exercising careful, reasoned judgment. As it al­&para;<br>ways has, and as it always will.&para;<br>VII&para;<br>The fact that the right to keep and bear arms appears in&para;<br>the Constitution should not obscure the novelty of the&para;<br>Court’s decision to enforce that right against the States.&para;<br>By its terms, the Second Amendment does not apply to the&para;<br>States; read properly, it does not even apply to individuals&para;<br>outside of the militia context.

And the Fourteenth Amendment has never been&para;<br>understood by the Court to have “incorporated” the entire&para;<br>Bill of Rights. There was nothing foreordained about&para;<br>today’s outcome.&para;<br>Although the Court’s decision in this case might be seen&para;<br>as a mere adjunct to its decision in Heller, the conse­&para;<br>quences could prove far more destructive—quite liter­&para;<br>ally—to our Nation’s communities and to our constitu­&para;<br>tional structure. Thankfully, the Second Amendment&para;<br>right identified in Heller and its newly minted Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment analogue are limited, at least for now, to the&para;<br>home. But neither the “assurances” provided by the plu­&para;<br>rality, ante, at 40, nor the many historical sources cited in&para;<br>its opinion should obscure the reality that today’s ruling&para;<br>marks a dramatic change in our law—or that the Justices&para;<br>who have joined it have brought to bear an awesome&para;<br>amount of discretion in resolving the legal question pre­&para;<br>sented by this case.&para;<br>I would proceed more cautiously. For the reasons set&para;<br>out at length above, I cannot accept either the methodol­&para;<br>ogy the Court employs or the conclusions it draws. Al­&para;<br>though impressively argued, the majority’s decision to&para;<br>overturn more than a century of Supreme Court precedent&para;<br>and to unsettle a much longer tradition of state practice is&para;<br>not, in my judgment, built “upon respect for the teachings&para;<br>of history, solid recognition of the basic values that under­&para;<br>lie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles&para;<br>that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers&para;<br>have played in establishing and preserving American&para;<br>freedoms.” Griswold, 381 U.

As he&para;<br>argues, the Framers did not write the Second Amendment&para;<br>with this objective in view. See ante, at 41–44 (dissenting&para;<br>opinion). Unlike other forms of substantive liberty, the&para;<br>carrying of arms for that purpose often puts others’ lives&para;<br>at risk. See ante, at 35–37. And the use of arms for pri&para;<br>vate self-defense does not warrant federal constitutional&para;<br>protection from state regulation. See ante, at 44–51.&para;<br>The Court, however, does not expressly rest its opinion&para;<br>upon “substantive due process” concerns. Rather, it di&para;<br>rects its attention to this Court’s “incorporation” prece&para;<br>dents and asks whether the Second Amendment right to&para;<br>private self-defense is “fundamental” so that it applies to&para;<br>the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. See ante,&para;<br>at 11–19.&para;<br>I shall therefore separately consider the question of&para;<br>“incorporation.” I can find nothing in the Second Amend&para;<br>ment’s text, history, or underlying rationale that could&para;<br>warrant characterizing it as “fundamental” insofar as it&para;<br>seeks to protect the keeping and bearing of arms for pri&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v.

Nor can I find any justification&para;<br>for interpreting the Constitution as transferring ultimate&para;<br>regulatory authority over the private uses of firearms from&para;<br>democratically elected legislatures to courts or from the&para;<br>States to the Federal Government. I therefore conclude&para;<br>that the Fourteenth Amendment does not “incorporate”&para;<br>the Second Amendment’s right “to keep and bear Arms.”&para;<br>And I consequently dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Second Amendment says: “A well regulated Militia,&para;<br>being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of&para;<br>the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”&para;<br>Two years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.

Although the Court acknowledged that&para;<br>“the threat that the new Federal Government would de&para;<br>stroy the citizens’ militia by taking away their arms was&para;<br>the reason that right . . . was codified in a written Consti&para;<br>tution,” the Court asserted that “individual self defense&para;<br>. . . was the central component of the right itself.” Heller,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 26) (first emphasis added).

Rev. 171 (2008).&para;<br>Consider as an example of these critiques an amici brief&para;<br>filed in this case by historians who specialize in the study&para;<br>of the English Civil Wars. They tell us that Heller misun&para;<br>derstood a key historical point. See Brief for Eng&para;<br>lish/Early American Historians as Amici Curiae (hereinaf&para;<br>ter English Historians’ Brief) (filed by 21 professors at&para;<br>leading universities in the United States, United King&para;<br>dom, and Australia). Heller’s conclusion that “individual&para;<br>self-defense” was “the central component” of the Second&para;<br>Amendment’s right “to keep and bear Arms” rested upon&para;<br>its view that the Amendment “codified a pre-existing right”&para;<br>that had “nothing whatever to do with service in a mili&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tia.” 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26, 19–20). That view in&para;<br>turn rested in significant part upon Blackstone having&para;<br>described the right as “ ‘the right of having and using arms&para;<br>for self-preservation and defence,’ ” which reflected the&para;<br>provision in the English Declaration of Right of 1689 that&para;<br>gave the King’s Protestant “ ‘subjects’ ” the right to “ ‘have&para;<br>Arms for their defence suitable to their Conditions, and as&para;<br>allowed by law.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 19–20) (quoting 1&para;<br>W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 140&para;<br>(1765) (hereinafter Blackstone) and 1 W. &amp; M., c. 2, §7, in&para;<br>3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441 (1689)). The Framers, said the&para;<br>majority, understood that right “as permitting a citizen to&para;<br>‘repe[l] force by force’ when ‘the intervention of society in&para;<br>his behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury.’ ” 554&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21) (quoting St. George Tucker, 1&para;<br>Blackstone’s Commentaries 145–146, n. 42 (1803)).&para;<br>The historians now tell us, however, that the right to&para;<br>which Blackstone referred had, not nothing, but every&para;<br>thing, to do with the militia. As properly understood at&para;<br>the time of the English Civil Wars, the historians claim,&para;<br>the right to bear arms “ensured that Parliament had the&para;<br>power” to arm the citizenry: “to defend the realm” in the&para;<br>case of a foreign enemy, and to “secure the right of ‘self&para;<br>preservation,’ ” or “self-defense,” should “the sovereign&para;<br>usurp the English Constitution.” English Historians’ Brief&para;<br>3, 8–13, 23–24 (emphasis added). Thus, the Declaration of&para;<br>Right says that private persons can possess guns only “as&para;<br>allowed by law.” See id., at 20–24. Moreover, when&para;<br>Blackstone referred to “ ‘the right of having and using&para;<br>arms for self-preservation and defence,’ ” he was referring&para;<br>to the right of the people “to take part in the militia to&para;<br>defend their political liberties,” and to the right of Parlia&para;<br>ment (which represented the people) to raise a militia even&para;<br>when the King sought to deny it that power.

At the least, where&para;<br>Heller’s historical foundations are so uncertain, why ex&para;<br>tend its applicability?&para;<br>My aim in referring to this history is to illustrate the&para;<br>reefs and shoals that lie in wait for those nonexpert judges&para;<br>who place virtually determinative weight upon historical&para;<br>considerations. In my own view, the Court should not look&para;<br>to history alone but to other factors as well—above all, in&para;<br>cases where the history is so unclear that the experts&para;<br>themselves strongly disagree. It should, for example,&para;<br>consider the basic values that underlie a constitutional&para;<br>provision and their contemporary significance. And it&para;<br>should examine as well the relevant consequences and&para;<br>practical justifications that might, or might not, warrant&para;<br>removing an important question from the democratic&para;<br>decisionmaking process. See ante, at 16–20 (STEVENS, J.,&para;<br>dissenting) (discussing shortcomings of an exclusively&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>historical approach).&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>In my view, taking Heller as a given, the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment does not incorporate the Second Amendment&para;<br>right to keep and bear arms for purposes of private self&para;<br>defense. Under this Court’s precedents, to incorporate the&para;<br>private self-defense right the majority must show that the&para;<br>right is, e.g., “fundamental to the American scheme of&para;<br>justice,” Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149 (1968);&para;<br>see ibid., n. 14; see also ante, at 44 (plurality opinion)&para;<br>(finding that the right is “fundamental” and therefore&para;<br>incorporated). And this it fails to do.&para;<br>The majority here, like that in Heller, relies almost&para;<br>exclusively upon history to make the necessary showing.&para;<br>Ante, at 20–33. But to do so for incorporation purposes is&para;<br>both wrong and dangerous. As JUSTICE STEVENS points&para;<br>out, our society has historically made mistakes—for ex&para;<br>ample, when considering certain 18th- and 19th-century&para;<br>property rights to be fundamental. Ante, at 19 (dissenting&para;<br>opinion). And in the incorporation context, as elsewhere,&para;<br>history often is unclear about the answers. See Part I,&para;<br>supra; Part III, infra.&para;<br>Accordingly, this Court, in considering an incorporation&para;<br>question, has never stated that the historical status of a&para;<br>right is the only relevant consideration. Rather, the Court&para;<br>has either explicitly or implicitly made clear in its opin&para;<br>ions that the right in question has remained fundamental&para;<br>over time. See, e.g., Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U. S. 404, 410&para;<br>(1972) (plurality opinion) (stating that the incorporation&para;<br>“inquiry must focus upon the function served” by the right&para;<br>in question in “contemporary society” (emphasis added));&para;<br>Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 154 (1968) (noting&para;<br>that the right in question “continues to receive strong&para;<br>support”); Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213, 226&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>(1967) (same). And, indeed, neither of the parties before&para;<br>us in this case has asked us to employ the majority’s his&para;<br>tory-constrained approach. See Brief for Petitioners 67–69&para;<br>(arguing for incorporation based on trends in contempo&para;<br>rary support for the right); Brief for Respondents City of&para;<br>Chicago et al. 23–31 (hereinafter Municipal Respondents)&para;<br>(looking to current state practices with respect to the&para;<br>right).&para;<br>I thus think it proper, above all where history provides&para;<br>no clear answer, to look to other factors in considering&para;<br>whether a right is sufficiently “fundamental” to remove it&para;<br>from the political process in every State. I would include&para;<br>among those factors the nature of the right; any contem&para;<br>porary disagreement about whether the right is funda&para;<br>mental; the extent to which incorporation will further&para;<br>other, perhaps more basic, constitutional aims; and the&para;<br>extent to which incorporation will advance or hinder the&para;<br>Constitution’s structural aims, including its division of&para;<br>powers among different governmental institutions (and&para;<br>the people as well). Is incorporation needed, for example,&para;<br>to further the Constitution’s effort to ensure that the&para;<br>government treats each individual with equal respect?&para;<br>Will it help maintain the democratic form of government&para;<br>that the Constitution foresees? In a word, will incorpora&para;<br>tion prove consistent, or inconsistent, with the Constitu&para;<br>tion’s efforts to create governmental institutions well&para;<br>suited to the carrying out of its constitutional promises?&para;<br>Finally, I would take account of the Framers’ basic&para;<br>reason for believing the Court ought to have the power of&para;<br>judicial review. Alexander Hamilton feared granting that&para;<br>power to Congress alone, for he feared that Congress,&para;<br>acting as judges, would not overturn as unconstitutional a&para;<br>popular statute that it had recently enacted, as legislators.&para;<br>The Federalist No. 78, p. 405 (G. Carey &amp; J. McClellan&para;<br>eds. 2001) (A. Hamilton) (“This independence of the judges&para;<br>is equally requisite to guard the constitution and the&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>rights of individuals from the effects of those ill humours,&para;<br>which” can, at times, lead to “serious oppressions of the&para;<br>minor part in the community”). Judges, he thought, may&para;<br>find it easier to resist popular pressure to suppress the&para;<br>basic rights of an unpopular minority. See United States&para;<br>v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152, n. 4 (1938).&para;<br>That being so, it makes sense to ask whether that particu&para;<br>lar comparative judicial advantage is relevant to the case&para;<br>at hand. See, e.g., J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust (1980).&para;<br>B&para;<br>How do these considerations apply here? For one thing,&para;<br>I would apply them only to the private self-defense right&para;<br>directly at issue. After all, the Amendment’s militia&para;<br>related purpose is primarily to protect States from federal&para;<br>regulation, not to protect individuals from militia-related&para;<br>regulation. Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26); see&para;<br>also Miller, 307 U. S., at 178. Moreover, the Civil War&para;<br>Amendments, the electoral process, the courts, and nu&para;<br>merous other institutions today help to safeguard the&para;<br>States and the people from any serious threat of federal&para;<br>tyranny. How are state militias additionally necessary?&para;<br>It is difficult to see how a right that, as the majority con&para;<br>cedes, has “largely faded as a popular concern” could&para;<br>possibly be so fundamental that it would warrant incorpo&para;<br>ration through the Fourteenth Amendment. Ante, at 22.&para;<br>Hence, the incorporation of the Second Amendment cannot&para;<br>be based on the militia-related aspect of what Heller found&para;<br>to be more extensive Second Amendment rights.&para;<br>For another thing, as Heller concedes, the private self&para;<br>defense right that the Court would incorporate has noth&para;<br>ing to do with “the reason” the Framers “codified” the right&para;<br>to keep and bear arms “in a written Constitution.” 554&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26) (emphasis added). Heller&para;<br>immediately adds that the self-defense right was nonethe&para;<br>less “the central component of the right.” Ibid. In my&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>view, this is the historical equivalent of a claim that water&para;<br>runs uphill. See Part I, supra. But, taking it as valid, the&para;<br>Framers’ basic reasons for including language in the Con&para;<br>stitution would nonetheless seem more pertinent (in decid&para;<br>ing about the contemporary importance of a right) than&para;<br>the particular scope 17th- or 18th-century listeners would&para;<br>have then assigned to the words they used. And examina&para;<br>tion of the Framers’ motivation tells us they did not think&para;<br>the private armed self-defense right was of paramount&para;<br>importance. See Amar, The Bill of Rights as a Constitu&para;<br>tion, 100 Yale L. J. 1131, 1164 (1991) (“[T]o see the [Sec&para;<br>ond] Amendment as primarily concerned with an individ&para;<br>ual right to hunt, or protect one’s home,” would be “like&para;<br>viewing the heart of the speech and assembly clauses as&para;<br>the right of persons to meet to play bridge”); see also, e.g.,&para;<br>Rakove, The Second Amendment: The Highest Stage of&para;<br>Originalism, 76 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 103, 127–128 (2000);&para;<br>Brief for Historians on Early American Legal, Constitu&para;<br>tional, and Pennsylvania History as Amici Curiae 22–33.&para;<br>Further, there is no popular consensus that the private&para;<br>self-defense right described in Heller is fundamental. The&para;<br>plurality suggests that two amici briefs filed in the case&para;<br>show such a consensus, see ante, at 42–43, but, of course,&para;<br>numerous amici briefs have been filed opposing incorpora&para;<br>tion as well. Moreover, every State regulates firearms&para;<br>extensively, and public opinion is sharply divided on the&para;<br>appropriate level of regulation. Much of this disagreement&para;<br>rests upon empirical considerations. One side believes the&para;<br>right essential to protect the lives of those attacked in the&para;<br>home; the other side believes it essential to regulate the&para;<br>right in order to protect the lives of others attacked with&para;<br>guns. It seems unlikely that definitive evidence will de&para;<br>velop one way or the other. And the appropriate level of&para;<br>firearm regulation has thus long been, and continues to&para;<br>be, a hotly contested matter of political debate. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Siegel, Dead or Alive: Originalism as Popular Constitu&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tionalism in Heller, 122 Harv. L. Rev. 191, 201–246 (2008).&para;<br>(Numerous sources supporting arguments and data in&para;<br>Part II–B can be found in the Appendix, infra.)&para;<br>Moreover, there is no reason here to believe that incor&para;<br>poration of the private self-defense right will further any&para;<br>other or broader constitutional objective. We are aware of&para;<br>no argument that gun-control regulations target or are&para;<br>passed with the purpose of targeting “discrete and insular&para;<br>minorities.” Carolene Products Co., supra, at 153, n. 4;&para;<br>see, e.g., ante, at 49–51 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Nor will&para;<br>incorporation help to assure equal respect for individuals.&para;<br>Unlike the First Amendment’s rights of free speech, free&para;<br>press, assembly, and petition, the private self-defense&para;<br>right does not comprise a necessary part of the democratic&para;<br>process that the Constitution seeks to establish. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 377 (1927) (Brandeis,&para;<br>J., concurring). Unlike the First Amendment’s religious&para;<br>protections, the Fourth Amendment’s protection against&para;<br>unreasonable searches and seizures, the Fifth and Sixth&para;<br>Amendments’ insistence upon fair criminal procedure, and&para;<br>the Eighth Amendment’s protection against cruel and&para;<br>unusual punishments, the private self-defense right does&para;<br>not significantly seek to protect individuals who might&para;<br>otherwise suffer unfair or inhumane treatment at the&para;<br>hands of a majority. Unlike the protections offered by&para;<br>many of these same Amendments, it does not involve&para;<br>matters as to which judges possess a comparative exper&para;<br>tise, by virtue of their close familiarity with the justice&para;<br>system and its operation. And, unlike the Fifth Amend&para;<br>ment’s insistence on just compensation, it does not involve&para;<br>a matter where a majority might unfairly seize for itself&para;<br>property belonging to a minority.&para;<br>Finally, incorporation of the right will work a significant&para;<br>disruption in the constitutional allocation of decisionmak&para;<br>ing authority, thereby interfering with the Constitution’s&para;<br>ability to further its objectives.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>First, on any reasonable accounting, the incorporation of&para;<br>the right recognized in Heller would amount to a signifi&para;<br>cant incursion on a traditional and important area of state&para;<br>concern, altering the constitutional relationship between&para;<br>the States and the Federal Government. Private gun&para;<br>regulation is the quintessential exercise of a State’s “police&para;<br>power”—i.e., the power to “protec[t] . . . the lives, limbs,&para;<br>health, comfort, and quiet of all persons, and the protec&para;<br>tion of all property within the State,” by enacting “all&para;<br>kinds of restraints and burdens” on both “persons and&para;<br>property.” Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 62 (1873)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court has long&para;<br>recognized that the Constitution grants the States special&para;<br>authority to enact laws pursuant to this power. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 475 (1996) (noting&para;<br>that States have “great latitude” to use their police powers&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted)); Metropolitan Life Ins.&para;<br>Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 756 (1985). A decade&para;<br>ago, we wrote that there is “no better example of the police&para;<br>power” than “the suppression of violent crime.” United&para;<br>States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618 (2000). And exam&para;<br>ples in which the Court has deferred to state legislative&para;<br>judgments in respect to the exercise of the police power&para;<br>are legion. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243,&para;<br>270 (2006) (assisted suicide); Washington v. Glucksberg,&para;<br>521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997) (same); Berman v. Parker, 348&para;<br>U. S. 26, 32 (1954) (“We deal, in other words, with what&para;<br>traditionally has been known as the police power. An&para;<br>attempt to define its reach or trace its outer limits is&para;<br>fruitless . . .”).&para;<br>Second, determining the constitutionality of a particular&para;<br>state gun law requires finding answers to complex empiri&para;<br>cally based questions of a kind that legislatures are better&para;<br>able than courts to make. See, e.g., Los Angeles v. Ala&para;<br>meda Books, Inc., 535 U. S. 425, 440 (2002) (plurality&para;<br>opinion); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>U. S. 180, 195–196 (1997). And it may require this kind of&para;<br>analysis in virtually every case.&para;<br>Government regulation of the right to bear arms nor&para;<br>mally embodies a judgment that the regulation will help&para;<br>save lives. The determination whether a gun regulation is&para;<br>constitutional would thus almost always require the&para;<br>weighing of the constitutional right to bear arms against&para;<br>the “primary concern of every government—a concern for&para;<br>the safety and indeed the lives of its citizens.” United&para;<br>States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 755 (1987). With respect&para;<br>to other incorporated rights, this sort of inquiry is some&para;<br>times present. See, e.g., Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S.&para;<br>444, 447 (1969) (per curiam) (free speech); Sherbert v.&para;<br>Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 403 (1963) (religion); Brigham City&para;<br>v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403–404 (2006) (Fourth Amend&para;<br>ment); New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 655 (1984)&para;<br>(Fifth Amendment); Salerno, supra, at 755 (bail). But&para;<br>here, this inquiry—calling for the fine tuning of protective&para;<br>rules—is likely to be part of a daily judicial diet.&para;<br>Given the competing interests, courts will have to try to&para;<br>answer empirical questions of a particularly difficult kind.&para;<br>Suppose, for example, that after a gun regulation’s adop&para;<br>tion the murder rate went up. Without the gun regulation&para;<br>would the murder rate have risen even faster? How is this&para;<br>conclusion affected by the local recession which has left&para;<br>numerous people unemployed? What about budget cuts&para;<br>that led to a downsizing of the police force? How effective&para;<br>was that police force to begin with? And did the regula&para;<br>tion simply take guns from those who use them for lawful&para;<br>purposes without affecting their possession by criminals?&para;<br>Consider too that countless gun regulations of many&para;<br>shapes and sizes are in place in every State and in many&para;<br>local communities. Does the right to possess weapons for&para;<br>self-defense extend outside the home? To the car? To&para;<br>work? What sort of guns are necessary for self-defense?&para;<br>Handguns? Rifles? Semiautomatic weapons? When is a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>gun semi-automatic? Where are different kinds of weap&para;<br>ons likely needed? Does time-of-day matter? Does the&para;<br>presence of a child in the house matter? Does the pres&para;<br>ence of a convicted felon in the house matter? Do police&para;<br>need special rules permitting patdowns designed to find&para;<br>guns? When do registration requirements become severe&para;<br>to the point that they amount to an unconstitutional ban?&para;<br>Who can possess guns and of what kind? Aliens? Prior&para;<br>drug offenders? Prior alcohol abusers? How would the&para;<br>right interact with a state or local government’s ability to&para;<br>take special measures during, say, national security emer&para;<br>gencies? As the questions suggest, state and local gun&para;<br>regulation can become highly complex, and these “are only&para;<br>a few uncertainties that quickly come to mind.” Caperton&para;<br>v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (slip op., at 10).&para;<br>The difficulty of finding answers to these questions is&para;<br>exceeded only by the importance of doing so. Firearms&para;<br>cause well over 60,000 deaths and injuries in the United&para;<br>States each year. Those who live in urban areas, police&para;<br>officers, women, and children, all may be particularly at&para;<br>risk. And gun regulation may save their lives. Some&para;<br>experts have calculated, for example, that Chicago’s hand&para;<br>gun ban has saved several hundred lives, perhaps close to&para;<br>1,000, since it was enacted in 1983. Other experts argue&para;<br>that stringent gun regulations “can help protect police&para;<br>officers operating on the front lines against gun violence,”&para;<br>have reduced homicide rates in Washington, D. C., and&para;<br>Baltimore, and have helped to lower New York’s crime and&para;<br>homicide rates.&para;<br>At the same time, the opponents of regulation cast doubt&para;<br>on these studies. And who is right? Finding out may&para;<br>require interpreting studies that are only indirectly re&para;<br>lated to a particular regulatory statute, say one banning&para;<br>handguns in the home. Suppose studies find more acci&para;<br>dents and suicides where there is a handgun in the home&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>than where there is a long gun in the home or no gun at&para;<br>all? To what extent do such studies justify a ban? What if&para;<br>opponents of the ban put forth counter studies?&para;<br>In answering such questions judges cannot simply refer&para;<br>to judicial homilies, such as Blackstone’s 18th-century&para;<br>perception that a man’s home is his castle. See 4 Black&para;<br>stone 223. Nor can the plurality so simply reject, by mere&para;<br>assertion, the fact that “incorporation will require judges&para;<br>to assess the costs and benefits of firearms restrictions.”&para;<br>Ante, at 44. How can the Court assess the strength of the&para;<br>government’s regulatory interests without addressing&para;<br>issues of empirical fact? How can the Court determine if a&para;<br>regulation is appropriately tailored without considering its&para;<br>impact? And how can the Court determine if there are&para;<br>less restrictive alternatives without considering what will&para;<br>happen if those alternatives are implemented?&para;<br>Perhaps the Court could lessen the difficulty of the&para;<br>mission it has created for itself by adopting a jurispruden&para;<br>tial approach similar to the many state courts that admin&para;<br>ister a state constitutional right to bear arms. See infra,&para;<br>at 19–20 (describing state approaches). But the Court has&para;<br>not yet done so. Cf. Heller, 544 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>57–64) (rejecting an “ ‘interest-balancing’ approach” simi&para;<br>lar to that employed by the States); ante, at 44 (plurality&para;<br>opinion). Rather, the Court has haphazardly created a few&para;<br>simple rules, such as that it will not touch “prohibitions on&para;<br>the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,”&para;<br>“laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive&para;<br>places such as schools and government buildings,” or “laws&para;<br>imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial&para;<br>sale of arms.” Heller, 544 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 54–55);&para;<br>Ante, at 39 (plurality opinion). But why these rules and&para;<br>not others? Does the Court know that these regulations&para;<br>are justified by some special gun-related risk of death? In&para;<br>fact, the Court does not know. It has simply invented&para;<br>rules that sound sensible without being able to explain&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Nor&para;<br>do they have readily available “tools” for finding and&para;<br>evaluating the technical material submitted by others.&para;<br>District Attorney’s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Os&para;<br>borne, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21); see also&para;<br>Turner Broadcasting, 520 U. S., at 195–196. Judges can&para;<br>not easily make empirically based predictions; they have&para;<br>no way to gather and evaluate the data required to see if&para;<br>such predictions are accurate; and the nature of litigation&para;<br>and concerns about stare decisis further make it difficult&para;<br>for judges to change course if predictions prove inaccurate.&para;<br>Nor can judges rely upon local community views and&para;<br>values when reaching judgments in circumstances where&para;<br>prediction is difficult because the basic facts are unclear or&para;<br>unknown.&para;<br>At the same time, there is no institutional need to send&para;<br>judges off on this “mission-almost-impossible.” Legislators&para;<br>are able to “amass the stuff of actual experience and cull&para;<br>conclusions from it.” United States v. Gainey, 380 U. S.&para;<br>63, 67 (1965). They are far better suited than judges to&para;<br>uncover facts and to understand their relevance. And&para;<br>legislators, unlike Article III judges, can be held democ&para;<br>ratically responsible for their empirically based and value&para;<br>laden conclusions. We have thus repeatedly affirmed our&para;<br>preference for “legislative not judicial solutions” to this&para;<br>kind of problem, see, e.g., Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla.,&para;<br>457 U. S. 496, 513 (1982), just as we have repeatedly&para;<br>affirmed the Constitution’s preference for democratic&para;<br>solutions legislated by those whom the people elect.&para;<br>In New State Ice Co. v.

The fact that this Court&para;<br>may already have refused to take this wise advice with&para;<br>respect to Congress in Heller is no reason to make matters&para;<br>worse here.&para;<br>Third, the ability of States to reflect local preferences&para;<br>and conditions—both key virtues of federalism—here has&para;<br>particular importance. The incidence of gun ownership&para;<br>varies substantially as between crowded cities and uncon&para;<br>gested rural communities, as well as among the different&para;<br>geographic regions of the country. Thus, approximately&para;<br>60% of adults who live in the relatively sparsely populated&para;<br>Western States of Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming report&para;<br>that their household keeps a gun, while fewer than 15% of&para;<br>adults in the densely populated Eastern States of Rhode&para;<br>Island, New Jersey, and Massachusetts say the same.&para;<br>The nature of gun violence also varies as between rural&para;<br>communities and cities. Urban centers face significantly&para;<br>greater levels of firearm crime and homicide, while rural&para;<br>communities have proportionately greater problems with&para;<br>nonhomicide gun deaths, such as suicides and accidents.&para;<br>And idiosyncratic local factors can lead to two cities find&para;<br>ing themselves in dramatically different circumstances:&para;<br>For example, in 2008, the murder rate was 40 times&para;<br>higher in New Orleans than it was in Lincoln, Nebraska.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>It is thus unsurprising that States and local communi&para;<br>ties have historically differed about the need for gun regu&para;<br>lation as well as about its proper level. Nor is it surpris&para;<br>ing that “primarily, and historically,” the law has treated&para;<br>the exercise of police powers, including gun control, as&para;<br>“matter[s] of local concern.” Medtronic, 518 U. S., at 475&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Fourth, although incorporation of any right removes&para;<br>decisions from the democratic process, the incorporation of&para;<br>this particular right does so without strong offsetting&para;<br>justification—as the example of Oak Park’s handgun ban&para;<br>helps to show. See Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code, §27–2–&para;<br>1 (1995). Oak Park decided to ban handguns in 1983,&para;<br>after a local attorney was shot to death with a handgun&para;<br>that his assailant had smuggled into a courtroom in a&para;<br>blanket. Brief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for&para;<br>Handgun Control as Amicus Curiae 1, 21 (hereinafter Oak&para;<br>Park Brief). A citizens committee spent months gathering&para;<br>information about handguns. Id., at 21. It secured 6,000&para;<br>signatures from community residents in support of a ban.&para;<br>Id., at 21–22. And the village board enacted a ban into&para;<br>law. Id., at 22.&para;<br>Subsequently, at the urging of ban opponents the Board&para;<br>held a community referendum on the matter. Ibid. The&para;<br>citizens committee argued strongly in favor of the ban.&para;<br>Id., at 22–23. It pointed out that most guns owned in Oak&para;<br>Park were handguns and that handguns were misused&para;<br>more often than citizens used them in self-defense. Id., at&para;<br>23. The ban opponents argued just as strongly to the&para;<br>contrary. Ibid. The public decided to keep the ban by a&para;<br>vote of 8,031 to 6,368. Ibid. And since that time, Oak&para;<br>Park now tells us, crime has decreased and the community&para;<br>has seen no accidental handgun deaths. Id., at 2.&para;<br>Given the empirical and local value-laden nature of the&para;<br>questions that lie at the heart of the issue, why, in a Na&para;<br>tion whose Constitution foresees democratic decisionmak&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ing, is it so fundamental a matter as to require taking that&para;<br>power from the people? What is it here that the people did&para;<br>not know? What is it that a judge knows better?&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>In sum, the police power, the superiority of legislative&para;<br>decisionmaking, the need for local decisionmaking, the&para;<br>comparative desirability of democratic decisionmaking,&para;<br>the lack of a manageable judicial standard, and the life&para;<br>threatening harm that may flow from striking down regu&para;<br>lations all argue against incorporation. Where the incor&para;<br>poration of other rights has been at issue, some of these&para;<br>problems have arisen. But in this instance all these prob&para;<br>lems are present, all at the same time, and all are likely to&para;<br>be present in most, perhaps nearly all, of the cases in&para;<br>which the constitutionality of a gun regulation is at issue.&para;<br>At the same time, the important factors that favor incor&para;<br>poration in other instances—e.g., the protection of broader&para;<br>constitutional objectives—are not present here. The up&para;<br>shot is that all factors militate against incorporation—&para;<br>with the possible exception of historical factors.&para;<br>III&para;<br>I must, then, return to history. The plurality, in seeking&para;<br>to justify incorporation, asks whether the interests the&para;<br>Second Amendment protects are “ ‘deeply rooted in this&para;<br>Nation’s history and tradition.’ ” Ante, at 19 (quoting&para;<br>Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721; internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). It looks to selected portions of the Nation’s&para;<br>history for the answer. And it finds an affirmative reply.&para;<br>As I have made clear, I do not believe history is the only&para;<br>pertinent consideration. Nor would I read history as&para;<br>broadly as the majority does. In particular, since we here&para;<br>are evaluating a more particular right—namely, the right&para;<br>to bear arms for purposes of private self-defense—general&para;<br>historical references to the “right to keep and bear arms”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>are not always helpful. Depending upon context, early&para;<br>historical sources may mean to refer to a militia-based&para;<br>right—a matter of considerable importance 200 years&para;<br>ago—which has, as the majority points out, “largely faded&para;<br>as a popular concern.” Ante, at 22. There is no reason to&para;<br>believe that matters of such little contemporary impor&para;<br>tance should play a significant role in answering the&para;<br>incorporation question. See Apodaca, 406 U. S., at 410&para;<br>(incorporation “inquiry must focus upon the function&para;<br>served” by the right in question in “contemporary soci&para;<br>ety”); Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, 27 (1949) (incorpora&para;<br>tion must take into account “the movements of a free&para;<br>society” and “the gradual and empiric process of inclusion&para;<br>and exclusion” (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf.&para;<br>U. S. Const., Art. I, §910 (prohibiting federal officeholders&para;<br>from accepting a “Title, of any kind whatever, from [a]&para;<br>foreign State”—presumably a matter of considerable&para;<br>importance 200 years ago).&para;<br>That said, I can find much in the historical record that&para;<br>shows that some Americans in some places at certain&para;<br>times thought it important to keep and bear arms for&para;<br>private self-defense. For instance, the reader will see that&para;<br>many States have constitutional provisions protecting gun&para;<br>possession. But, as far as I can tell, those provisions&para;<br>typically do no more than guarantee that a gun regulation&para;<br>will be a reasonable police power regulation. See Winkler,&para;<br>Scrutinizing the Second Amendment, 105 Mich. L. Rev.&para;<br>683, 686, 716–717 (2007) (the “courts of every state to&para;<br>consider the question apply a deferential ‘reasonable&para;<br>regulation’ standard”) (hereinafter Winkler, Scrutinizing);&para;<br>see also id., at 716–717 (explaining the difference between&para;<br>that standard and ordinary rational-basis review). It is&para;<br>thus altogether unclear whether such provisions would&para;<br>prohibit cities such as Chicago from enacting laws, such as&para;<br>the law before us, banning handguns. See id., at 723. The&para;<br>majority, however, would incorporate a right that is likely&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>inconsistent with Chicago’s law; and the majority would&para;<br>almost certainly strike down that law. Cf. Heller, 554&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57–64) (striking down the District&para;<br>of Columbia’s handgun ban).&para;<br>Thus, the specific question before us is not whether&para;<br>there are references to the right to bear arms for self&para;<br>defense throughout this Nation’s history—of course there&para;<br>are—or even whether the Court should incorporate a&para;<br>simple constitutional requirement that firearms regula&para;<br>tions not unreasonably burden the right to keep and bear&para;<br>arms, but rather whether there is a consensus that so&para;<br>substantial a private self-defense right as the one de&para;<br>scribed in Heller applies to the States. See, e.g., Glucks&para;<br>berg, supra, at 721 (requiring “a careful description” of the&para;<br>right at issue when deciding whether it is “deeply rooted&para;<br>in this Nation’s history and tradition” (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted)). On this question, the reader will have to&para;<br>make up his or her own mind about the historical record&para;<br>that I describe in part below. In my view, that record is&para;<br>insufficient to say that the right to bear arms for private&para;<br>self-defense, as explicated by Heller, is fundamental in the&para;<br>sense relevant to the incorporation inquiry. As the evi&para;<br>dence below shows, States and localities have consistently&para;<br>enacted firearms regulations, including regulations simi&para;<br>lar to those at issue here, throughout our Nation’s history.&para;<br>Courts have repeatedly upheld such regulations. And it is,&para;<br>at the very least, possible, and perhaps likely, that incor&para;<br>poration will impose on every, or nearly every, State a&para;<br>different right to bear arms than they currently recog&para;<br>nize—a right that threatens to destabilize settled state&para;<br>legal principles. Cf. 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57–64)&para;<br>(rejecting an “ ‘interest-balancing’ approach” similar to&para;<br>that employed by the States).&para;<br>I thus cannot find a historical consensus with respect to&para;<br>whether the right described by Heller is “fundamental” as&para;<br>our incorporation cases use that term. Nor can I find&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sufficient historical support for the majority’s conclusion&para;<br>that that right is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history&para;<br>and tradition.” Instead, I find no more than ambiguity&para;<br>and uncertainty that perhaps even expert historians&para;<br>would find difficult to penetrate. And a historical record&para;<br>that is so ambiguous cannot itself provide an adequate&para;<br>basis for incorporating a private right of self-defense and&para;<br>applying it against the States.&para;<br>The Eighteenth Century&para;<br>The opinions in Heller collect much of the relevant 18th&para;<br>century evidence. See 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5–32);&para;<br>id., at ___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5–31); id.,&para;<br>at ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4–7). In respect&para;<br>to the relevant question—the “deeply rooted nature” of a&para;<br>right to keep and bear arms for purposes of private self&para;<br>defense—that evidence is inconclusive, particularly when&para;<br>augmented as follows:&para;<br>First, as I have noted earlier in this opinion, and JUSTICE STEVENS argued in dissent, the history discussed in&para;<br>Heller shows that the Second Amendment was enacted&para;<br>primarily for the purpose of protecting militia-related&para;<br>rights. See supra, at 4; Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5–&para;<br>31). Many of the scholars and historians who have written&para;<br>on the subject apparently agree. See supra, at 2–5.&para;<br>Second, historians now tell us that the right to which&para;<br>Blackstone referred, an important link in the Heller ma&para;<br>jority’s historical argument, concerned the right of Par&para;<br>liament (representing the people) to form a militia to&para;<br>oppose a tyrant (the King) threatening to deprive the&para;<br>people of their traditional liberties (which did not include&para;<br>an unregulated right to possess guns). Thus, 18th-century&para;<br>language referring to a “right to keep and bear arms” does&para;<br>not ipso facto refer to a private right of self-defense—&para;<br>certainly not unambiguously so. See English Historians’&para;<br>Brief 3–27; see also supra, at 2–5.&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Third, scholarly articles indicate that firearms were&para;<br>heavily regulated at the time of the framing—perhaps&para;<br>more heavily regulated than the Court in Heller believed.&para;<br>For example, one scholar writes that “[h]undreds of indi&para;<br>vidual statutes regulated the possession and use of guns&para;<br>in colonial and early national America.” Churchill, Gun&para;<br>Regulation, the Police Power, and the Right to Keep Arms,&para;<br>25 Law &amp; Hist. Rev. 139, 143 (2007). Among these stat&para;<br>utes was a ban on the private firing of weapons in Boston,&para;<br>as well as comprehensive restrictions on similar conduct&para;<br>in Philadelphia and New York. See Acts and Laws of&para;<br>Massachusetts, p. 208 (1746); 5 J. Mitchell, &amp; H. Flanders,&para;<br>Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania From 1682 to 1801, pp.&para;<br>108–109 (1898); 4 Colonial Laws of New York ch. 1233, p.&para;<br>748 (1894); see also Churchill, supra, at 162–163 (discuss&para;<br>ing bans on the shooting of guns in Pennsylvania and New&para;<br>York).&para;<br>Fourth, after the Constitution was adopted, several&para;<br>States continued to regulate firearms possession by, for&para;<br>example, adopting rules that would have prevented the&para;<br>carrying of loaded firearms in the city, Heller, 554 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 5–7) (BREYER, J., dissenting); see also id.,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 59–60). Scholars have thus concluded&para;<br>that the primary Revolutionary era limitation on a State’s&para;<br>police power to regulate guns appears to be only that&para;<br>regulations were “aimed at a legitimate public purpose”&para;<br>and “consistent with reason.” Cornell, Early American&para;<br>Gun Regulation and the Second Amendment, 25 Law &amp;&para;<br>Hist. Rev. 197, 198 (2007).&para;<br>The Pre-Civil War Nineteenth Century&para;<br>I would also augment the majority’s account of this&para;<br>period as follows:&para;<br>First, additional States began to regulate the discharge&para;<br>of firearms in public places. See, e.g., Act of Feb. 17, 1831,&para;<br>§6, reprinted in 3 Statutes of Ohio and the Northwestern&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Territory 1740 (S. Chase ed. 1835); Act of Dec. 3, 1825, ch.&para;<br>CCXCII, §3, 1825 Tenn. Priv. Acts 306.&para;<br>Second, States began to regulate the possession of con&para;<br>cealed weapons, which were both popular and dangerous.&para;<br>See, e.g., C. Cramer, Concealed Weapon Laws of the Early&para;<br>Republic 143–152 (1999) (collecting examples); see also&para;<br>1837–1838 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 137, pp. 200–201 (banning&para;<br>the wearing, sale, or giving of Bowie knives); 1847 Va.&para;<br>Acts ch. 7, §8, p. 110, (“Any free person who shall habitu&para;<br>ally carry about his person, hidden from common observa&para;<br>tion, any pistol, dirk, bowie knife, or weapon of the like&para;<br>kind, from the use of which the death of any person might&para;<br>probably ensue, shall for every offense be punished by [a]&para;<br>fine not exceed fifty dollars”).&para;<br>State courts repeatedly upheld the validity of such laws,&para;<br>finding that, even when the state constitution granted a&para;<br>right to bear arms, the legislature was permitted to, e.g.,&para;<br>“abolish” these small, inexpensive, “most dangerous weap&para;<br>ons entirely from use,” even in self-defense. Day v. State,&para;<br>37 Tenn. 496, 500 (1857); see also, e.g., State v. Jumel, 13&para;<br>La. Ann. 399, 400 (1858) (upholding concealed weapon ban&para;<br>because it “prohibited only a particular mode of bearing&para;<br>arms which is found dangerous to the peace of society”);&para;<br>State v. Chandler, 5 La. Ann. 489, 489–490 (1850) (uphold&para;<br>ing concealed weapon ban and describing the law as “abso&para;<br>lutely necessary to counteract a vicious state of society,&para;<br>growing out of the habit of carrying concealed weapons”);&para;<br>State v. Reid, 1 Ala. 612, 616–617 (1840).&para;<br>The Post-Civil War Nineteenth Century&para;<br>It is important to read the majority’s account with the&para;<br>following considerations in mind:&para;<br>First, the Court today properly declines to revisit our&para;<br>interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause. See&para;<br>ante, at 10. The Court’s case for incorporation must thus&para;<br>rest on the conclusion that the right to bear arms is “fun&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>damental.” But the very evidence that it advances in&para;<br>support of the conclusion that Reconstruction-era Ameri&para;<br>cans strongly supported a private self-defense right shows&para;<br>with equal force that Americans wanted African-American&para;<br>citizens to have the same rights to possess guns as did&para;<br>white citizens. Ante, at 22–33. Here, for example is what&para;<br>Congress said when it enacted a Fourteenth Amendment&para;<br>predecessor, the Second Freedman’s Bureau Act. It wrote&para;<br>that the statute, in order to secure “the constitutional&para;<br>right to bear arms . . . for all citizens,” would assure that&para;<br>each citizen:&para;<br>“shall have . . . full and equal benefit of all laws and&para;<br>proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal se&para;<br>curity, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition&para;<br>of estate, real and personal, including the constitu&para;<br>tional right to bear arms, [by securing] . . . to . . . all&para;<br>the citizens of [every] . . . State or district without re&para;<br>spect to race or color, or previous condition of slavery.”&para;<br>§14, 14 Stat. 176–177 (emphasis added).&para;<br>This sounds like an antidiscrimination provision. See&para;<br>Rosenthal, The New Originalism Meets the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment: Original Public Meaning and the Problem of&para;<br>Incorporation, 18 J. Contemp. Legal Issues 361, 383–384&para;<br>(2009) (discussing evidence that the Freedmen’s Bureau&para;<br>was focused on discrimination).&para;<br>Another Fourteenth Amendment predecessor, the Civil&para;<br>Rights Act of 1866, also took aim at discrimination. See&para;<br>§1, 14 Stat. 27 (citizens of “every race and color, without&para;<br>regard to any previous condition of slavery or involuntary&para;<br>servitude . . . shall have the same right [to engage in&para;<br>various activities] and to full and equal benefit of all laws&para;<br>. . . as is enjoyed by white citizens”). And, of course, the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment itself insists that all States guar&para;<br>antee their citizens the “equal protection of the laws.”&para;<br>There is thus every reason to believe that the funda&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>mental concern of the Reconstruction Congress was the&para;<br>eradication of discrimination, not the provision of a new&para;<br>substantive right to bear arms free from reasonable state&para;<br>police power regulation. See, e.g., Brief for Municipal&para;<br>Respondents 62–69 (discussing congressional record evi&para;<br>dence that Reconstruction Congress was concerned about&para;<br>discrimination). Indeed, why would those who wrote the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment have wanted to give such a right&para;<br>to Southerners who had so recently waged war against the&para;<br>North, and who continued to disarm and oppress recently&para;<br>freed African-American citizens? Cf. Act of Mar. 2, 1867,&para;<br>§6, 14 Stat. 487 (disbanding Southern militias because&para;<br>they were, inter alia, disarming the freedmen).&para;<br>Second, firearms regulation in the later part of the 19th&para;<br>century was common. The majority is correct that the&para;<br>Freedmen’s Bureau points to a right to bear arms, and it&para;<br>stands to reason, as the majority points out, that “[i]t&para;<br>would have been nonsensical for Congress to guarantee&para;<br>the . . . equal benefit of a . . . right that does not exist.”&para;<br>Ante, at 32. But the majority points to no evidence that&para;<br>there existed during this period a fundamental right to&para;<br>bear arms for private self-defense immune to the reason&para;<br>able exercise of the state police power. See Emberton, The&para;<br>Limits of Incorporation: Violence, Gun Rights, and Gun&para;<br>Regulation in the Reconstruction South, 17 Stan. L. &amp;&para;<br>Pol’y Rev. 615, 621–622 (2006) (noting that history shows&para;<br>that “nineteenth-century Americans” were “not opposed to&para;<br>the idea that the state should be able to control the use of&para;<br>firearms”).&para;<br>To the contrary, in the latter half of the 19th century, a&para;<br>number of state constitutions adopted or amended after&para;<br>the Civil War explicitly recognized the legislature’s gen&para;<br>eral ability to limit the right to bear arms. See Tex.&para;<br>Const., Art. I, §13 (1869) (protecting “the right to keep and&para;<br>bear arms,” “under such regulations as the legislature&para;<br>may prescribe”); Idaho Const., Art. I, §11 (1889) (“The&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>people have the right to bear arms . . .; but the Legislature&para;<br>shall regulate the exercise of this right by law”); Utah&para;<br>Const., Art. I, §6 (1896) (same). And numerous other state&para;<br>constitutional provisions adopted during this period ex&para;<br>plicitly granted the legislature various types of regulatory&para;<br>power over firearms. See Brief for Thirty-Four Profes&para;<br>sional Historians et al. as Amici Curiae 14–15 (hereinafter&para;<br>Legal Historians’ Brief).&para;<br>Moreover, four States largely banned the possession of&para;<br>all nonmilitary handguns during this period. See 1879&para;<br>Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 186, §1 (prohibiting citizens from&para;<br>carrying “publicly or privately, any . . . belt or pocket&para;<br>pistol, revolver, or any kind of pistol, except the army or&para;<br>navy pistol, usually used in warfare, which shall be car&para;<br>ried openly in the hand”); 1876 Wyo. Comp. Laws ch. 52,&para;<br>§1 (forbidding “concealed or ope[n]” bearing of “any fire&para;<br>arm or other deadly weapon, within the limits of any city,&para;<br>town or village”); Ark. Act of Apr. 1, 1881, ch. 96, §1 (pro&para;<br>hibiting the “wear[ing] or carry[ng]” of “any pistol . . .&para;<br>except such pistols as are used in the army or navy,”&para;<br>except while traveling or at home); Tex. Act of Apr. 12,&para;<br>1871, ch. 34 (prohibiting the carrying of pistols unless&para;<br>there are “immediate and pressing” reasonable grounds to&para;<br>fear “immediate and pressing” attack or for militia ser&para;<br>vice). Fifteen States banned the concealed carry of pistols&para;<br>and other deadly weapons. See Legal Historians’ Brief 16,&para;<br>n. 14. And individual municipalities enacted stringent&para;<br>gun controls, often in response to local conditions—Dodge&para;<br>City, Kansas, for example, joined many western cattle&para;<br>towns in banning the carrying of pistols and other danger&para;<br>ous weapons in response to violence accompanying west&para;<br>ern cattle drives. See Brief for Municipal Respondents 30&para;<br>(citing Dodge City, Kan., Ordinance No. 16, §XI (Sept. 22,&para;<br>1876)); D. Courtwright, The Cowboy Subculture, in Guns&para;<br>in America: A Reader 96 (J. Dizard et al. eds. 1999) (dis&para;<br>cussing how Western cattle towns required cowboys to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>27&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“check” their guns upon entering town).&para;<br>Further, much as they had during the period before the&para;<br>Civil War, state courts routinely upheld such restrictions.&para;<br>See, e.g., English v. State, 35 Tex. 473 (1871); Hill v. State,&para;<br>53 Ga. 472, 475 (1874); Fife v. State, 31 Ark. 455, 461&para;<br>(1876); State v. Workman, 35 W. Va. 367, 373 (1891). The&para;<br>Tennessee Supreme Court, in upholding a ban on posses&para;<br>sion of nonmilitary handguns and certain other weapons,&para;<br>summarized the Reconstruction understanding of the&para;<br>states’ police power to regulate firearms:&para;<br>“Admitting the right of self-defense in its broadest&para;<br>sense, still on sound principle every good citizen is&para;<br>bound to yield his preference as to the means to be&para;<br>used, to the demands of the public good; and where&para;<br>certain weapons are forbidden to be kept or used by the&para;<br>law of the land, in order to the prevention of [sic]&para;<br>crime—a great public end—no man can be permitted&para;<br>to disregard this general end, and demand of the&para;<br>community the right, in order to gratify his whim or&para;<br>willful desire to use a particular weapon in his par&para;<br>ticular self-defense. The law allows ample means of&para;<br>self-defense, without the use of the weapons which we&para;<br>have held may be rightfully prescribed by this statute.&para;<br>The object being to banish these weapons from the&para;<br>community by an absolute prohibition for the preven&para;<br>tion of crime, no man’s particular safety, if such case&para;<br>could exist, ought to be allowed to defeat this end.”&para;<br>Andrews v. State, 50 Tenn. 165, 188–189 (1871) (em&para;<br>phasis added).&para;<br>The Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries&para;<br>Although the majority does not discuss 20th- or 21st&para;<br>century evidence concerning the Second Amendment at&para;<br>any length, I think that it is essential to consider the&para;<br>recent history of the right to bear arms for private self&para;<br>defense when considering whether the right is “fundamen&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tal.” To that end, many States now provide state constitu&para;<br>tional protection for an individual’s right to keep and bear&para;<br>arms. See Volokh, State Constitutional Rights to Keep&para;<br>and Bear Arms, 11 Tex. Rev. L. &amp; Pol. 191, 205 (2006)&para;<br>(identifying over 40 States). In determining the impor&para;<br>tance of this fact, we should keep the following considera&para;<br>tions in mind:&para;<br>First, by the end of the 20th century, in every State and&para;<br>many local communities, highly detailed and complicated&para;<br>regulatory schemes governed (and continue to govern)&para;<br>nearly every aspect of firearm ownership: Who may sell&para;<br>guns and how they must be sold; who may purchase guns&para;<br>and what type of guns may be purchased; how firearms&para;<br>must be stored and where they may be used; and so on.&para;<br>See generally Legal Community Against Violence, Regu&para;<br>lating Guns In America (2008), available at http://&para;<br>www.lcav.org/publications-briefs/regulating_guns. asp (all&para;<br>Internet materials as visited June 24, 2010, and available&para;<br>in Clerk of Court’s case file) (detailing various arms regu&para;<br>lations in every State).&para;<br>Of particular relevance here, some municipalities ban&para;<br>handguns, even in States that constitutionally protect the&para;<br>right to bear arms. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code, §8–&para;<br>20–050(c) (2009); Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code, §§27–2–&para;<br>1, 27–1–1 (1995); Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code, ch. 549.25&para;<br>(2010). Moreover, at least seven States and Puerto Rico&para;<br>ban assault weapons or semiautomatic weapons. See Cal.&para;<br>Penal Code Ann. §12280(b) (West Supp. 2009); Conn. Gen.&para;<br>Stat. Ann. §53–202c (2007); Haw. Rev. Stat. §134–8&para;<br>(1993); Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. §4–303(a) (Lexis 2002);&para;<br>Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 140, §131M (West 2006); N. J.

Law Code Ann. §4–303&para;<br>(Lexis 2002).&para;<br>Second, as I stated earlier, state courts in States with&para;<br>constitutions that provide gun rights have almost uni&para;<br>formly interpreted those rights as providing protection&para;<br>only against unreasonable regulation of guns. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Winkler, Scrutinizing 686 (the “courts of every state to&para;<br>consider” a gun regulation apply the “ ‘reasonable regula&para;<br>tion’ ” approach); State v. McAdams, 714 P. 2d 1236, 1238&para;<br>(Wyo. 1986); Robertson v. City &amp; County of Denver, 874&para;<br>P. 2d 325, 328 (Colo. 1994).&para;<br>When determining reasonableness those courts have&para;<br>normally adopted a highly deferential attitude towards&para;<br>legislative determinations. See Winkler, Scrutinizing 723&para;<br>(identifying only six cases in the 60 years before the arti&para;<br>cle’s publication striking down gun control laws: three that&para;<br>banned “the transportation of any firearms for any pur&para;<br>pose whatsoever,” a single “permitting law,” and two as&para;<br>applied challenges in “unusual circumstances”). Hence, as&para;<br>evidenced by the breadth of existing regulations, States&para;<br>and local governments maintain substantial flexibility to&para;<br>regulate firearms—much as they seemingly have through&para;<br>out the Nation’s history—even in those States with an&para;<br>arms right in their constitutions.&para;<br>&para;<br>30&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v. CHICAGO&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Although one scholar implies that state courts are less&para;<br>willing to permit total gun prohibitions, see Volokh, Im&para;<br>plementing the Right to Keep and Bear Arms for SelfDefense: An Analytical Framework and a Research&para;<br>Agenda, 56 UCLA L. Rev. 1443, 1458 (2009), I am aware&para;<br>of no instances in the past 50 years in which a state court&para;<br>has struck down as unconstitutional a law banning a&para;<br>particular class of firearms, see Winkler, Scrutinizing 723.&para;<br>Indeed, state courts have specifically upheld as constitu&para;<br>tional (under their state constitutions) firearms regula&para;<br>tions that have included handgun bans. See Kalodimos v.&para;<br>Village of Morton Grove, 103 Ill. 2d 483, 499, 470 N. E. 2d&para;<br>266, 273 (1984) (upholding a handgun ban because the&para;<br>arms right is merely a right “to possess some form of&para;<br>weapon suitable for self-defense or recreation”); Cleveland&para;<br>v. Turner, No. 36126, 1977 WL 201393, *5 (Ohio Ct. App.,&para;<br>Aug. 4, 1977) (handgun ban “does not absolutely interfere&para;<br>with the right of the people to bear arms, but rather pro&para;<br>scribes possession of a specifically defined category of&para;<br>handguns”); State v. Bolin 378 S. C. 96, 99, 662 S. E. 2d&para;<br>38, 39 (2008) (ban on handgun possession by persons&para;<br>under 21 did not infringe arms right because they can&para;<br>“posses[s] other types of guns”). Thus, the majority’s&para;<br>decision to incorporate the private self-defense right rec&para;<br>ognized in Heller threatens to alter state regulatory re&para;<br>gimes, at least as they pertain to handguns.&para;<br>Third, the plurality correctly points out that only a few&para;<br>state courts, a “paucity” of state courts, have specifically&para;<br>upheld handgun bans. Ante, at 39. But which state courts&para;<br>have struck them down? The absence of supporting in&para;<br>formation does not help the majority find support. Cf.&para;<br>United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 496 (1997) (noting&para;<br>that it is “treacherous to find in congressional silence&para;<br>alone the adoption of a controlling rule of law” (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted)). Silence does not show or tend&para;<br>to show a consensus that a private self-defense right&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>31&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>(strong enough to strike down a handgun ban) is “deeply&para;<br>rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.”&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>In sum, the Framers did not write the Second Amend&para;<br>ment in order to protect a private right of armed self&para;<br>defense. There has been, and is, no consensus that the&para;<br>right is, or was, “fundamental.” No broader constitutional&para;<br>interest or principle supports legal treatment of that right&para;<br>as fundamental. To the contrary, broader constitutional&para;<br>concerns of an institutional nature argue strongly against&para;<br>that treatment.&para;<br>Moreover, nothing in 18th-, 19th-, 20th-, or 21st-century&para;<br>history shows a consensus that the right to private armed&para;<br>self-defense, as described in Heller, is “deeply rooted in&para;<br>this Nation’s history or tradition” or is otherwise “funda&para;<br>mental.” Indeed, incorporating the right recognized in&para;<br>Heller may change the law in many of the 50 States. Read&para;<br>in the majority’s favor, the historical evidence is at most&para;<br>ambiguous. And, in the absence of any other support for&para;<br>its conclusion, ambiguous history cannot show that the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment incorporates a private right of&para;<br>self-defense against the States.&para;<br>With respect, I dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDONALD v.
