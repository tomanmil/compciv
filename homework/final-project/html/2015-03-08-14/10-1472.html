Argued February 21, 2012—Decided May 21, 2012&para;<br>Title 28 U. S. C. §1920, as amended by the Court Interpreters Act, includes “compensation of interpreters” among the costs that may be&para;<br>awarded to prevailing parties in federal-court lawsuits. §1920(6). In&para;<br>this case, the District Court awarded costs to respondent as the prevailing party in a civil action instituted by petitioner. The award included the cost of translating from Japanese to English certain documents that respondent used in preparing its defense. The Ninth&para;<br>Circuit affirmed, concluding that §1920(6) covers the cost of translating documents as well as the cost of translating live speech.&para;<br>Held: Because the ordinary meaning of “interpreter” is someone who&para;<br>translates orally from one language to another, the category “compensation of interpreters” in §1920(6) does not include the cost of&para;<br>document translation. Pp. 3−15.&para;<br>(a) Section 1920 reflects the substance of an 1853 Act that specified&para;<br>for the first time what costs are allowable in federal court. That provision defines the term “costs” as used in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), which gives courts the discretion to award costs to prevailing parties. Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S.&para;<br>437, 441. As originally configured, §1920 contained five categories of&para;<br>taxable costs, but in 1978, Congress enacted the Court Interpreters&para;<br>Act, which added a sixth category that includes “compensation of interpreters.” §1920(6). Pp. 3−5.&para;<br>(b) Because the term “interpreter” is not defined in the Court Interpreters Act or in any other relevant statutory provision, it must be&para;<br>given its ordinary meaning. Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S.&para;<br>179, 187. When Congress passed that Act in 1978, many dictionaries&para;<br>defined “interpreter” as one who translates spoken, as opposed to&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>written, language. Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally defined&para;<br>“interpreter” and “interpret” in terms of oral translation. Respondent&para;<br>relies almost exclusively on a version of Webster’s Third New International Dictionary that defined “interpreter” as “one that translates;&para;<br>esp: a person who translates orally for parties conversing in different&para;<br>tongues.” Although the sense divider esp (for especially) indicates&para;<br>that the most common meaning of the term is one “who translates&para;<br>orally,” that meaning is subsumed within the more general definition&para;<br>“one that translates.” That a definition is broad enough to encompass&para;<br>one sense of a word does not establish, however, that the word is ordinarily understood in that sense. See Mallard v. United States Dist.&para;<br>Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 490 U. S. 296, 301. Although all&para;<br>relevant dictionaries defined “interpreter” at the time of the statute’s&para;<br>enactment as including persons who translate orally, only a handful&para;<br>defined the word broadly enough to encompass translators of written&para;<br>materials. Notably, the Oxford English Dictionary, one of the most&para;<br>authoritative, recognized that “interpreter” can mean one who translates writings, but it expressly designated that meaning as obsolete.&para;<br>Any definition of a word that is absent from many dictionaries and is&para;<br>deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common or ordinary meaning.&para;<br>Given this survey of relevant dictionaries, the ordinary meaning of&para;<br>“interpreter” does not include those who translate writings. Nothing&para;<br>in the Court Interpreters Act or in §1920 hints that Congress intended to go beyond this ordinary meaning. If anything, the statutory&para;<br>context suggests that “interpreter” includes only those who translate&para;<br>orally. See 28 U. S. C. §1827. Moreover, Congress’ use of technical&para;<br>terminology reflects the distinction in relevant professional literature&para;<br>between interpreters, who are used for oral conversations, and translators, who are used for written communications. Pp. 5−11.&para;<br>(c) No other tool of construction compels a departure from the ordinary meaning of “interpreter.” This Court has never held that Rule&para;<br>54(d) creates a presumption in favor of the broadest possible reading&para;<br>of the costs enumerated in §1920. To the contrary, the Court has&para;<br>made clear that the “discretion granted by Rule 54(d) is not a power&para;<br>to evade” the specific categories of costs set forth by Congress, Crawford Fitting, supra, at 442, but “is solely a power to decline to tax, as&para;<br>costs, the items enumerated in §1920,” ibid. This Court’s conclusion&para;<br>is in keeping with the narrow bounds of taxable costs, which are&para;<br>limited by statute and modest in scope. Respondent’s extratextual&para;<br>arguments―that documentary evidence is no less important than testimonial evidence and that some translation tasks are not entirely&para;<br>oral or entirely written―are more properly directed at Congress. In&para;<br>any event, neither argument is so compelling that Congress must&para;<br>have intended to dispense with the ordinary meaning of “interpreter”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

The question presented in this case is whether “compensation of interpreters” covers the cost of translating documents. Because the&para;<br>ordinary meaning of the word “interpreter” is a person&para;<br>who translates orally from one language to another, we&para;<br>hold that “compensation of interpreters” is limited to the&para;<br>cost of oral translation and does not include the cost of&para;<br>document translation.&para;<br>I&para;<br>This case arises from a personal injury action brought&para;<br>by petitioner Kouichi Taniguchi, a professional baseball&para;<br>player in Japan, against respondent Kan Pacific Saipan,&para;<br>Ltd., the owner of a resort in the Northern Mariana Islands. Petitioner was injured when his leg broke through&para;<br>a wooden deck during a tour of respondent’s resort property. Initially, petitioner said that he needed no medical&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>attention, but two weeks later, he informed respondent&para;<br>that he had suffered cuts, bruises, and torn ligaments&para;<br>from the accident. Due to these alleged injuries, he&para;<br>claimed damages for medical expenses and for lost income&para;<br>from contracts he was unable to honor. After discovery&para;<br>concluded, both parties moved for summary judgment.&para;<br>The United States District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands granted respondent’s motion on the ground&para;<br>that petitioner offered no evidence that respondent knew&para;<br>of the defective deck or otherwise failed to exercise reasonable care.&para;<br>In preparing its defense, respondent paid to have various documents translated from Japanese to English. After&para;<br>the District Court granted summary judgment in respondent’s favor, respondent submitted a bill for those costs.&para;<br>Over petitioner’s objection, the District Court awarded&para;<br>the costs to respondent as “compensation of interpreters”&para;<br>under §1920(6). Explaining that interpreter services “cannot be separated into ‘translation’ and ‘interpretation,’ ”&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a, the court held that costs&para;<br>for document translation “fal[l] within the meaning of&para;<br>‘compensation of an interpreter,’ ” ibid. Finding that it&para;<br>was necessary for respondent to have the documents&para;<br>translated in order to depose petitioner, the court concluded that the translation services were properly taxed&para;<br>as costs.&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed both the District Court’s grant of summary&para;<br>judgment and its award of costs. The court rejected petitioner’s argument that the cost of document translation&para;<br>services is not recoverable as “compensation of interpreters.” The court explained that “the word ‘interpreter’ can&para;<br>reasonably encompass a ‘translator,’ both according to the&para;<br>dictionary definition and common usage of these terms,&para;<br>which does not always draw precise distinctions between&para;<br>foreign language interpretations involving live speech&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

The court thus concluded that “the prevailing party&para;<br>should be awarded costs for services required to interpret&para;<br>either live speech or written documents into a familiar&para;<br>language, so long as interpretation of the items is necessary to the litigation.” Id., at 1221–1222.&para;<br>Because there is a split among the Courts of Appeals on&para;<br>this issue,1 we granted certiorari. 564 U.

Yet&para;<br>even in the absence of express legislative authorization,&para;<br>the practice of referring to state rules for the taxation of&para;<br>costs persisted. See Alyeska Pipeline, 421 U. S., at 250.&para;<br>Not until 1853 did Congress enact legislation specifying&para;<br>the costs allowable in federal court. Id., at 251. The&para;<br>impetus for a uniform federal rule was largely the consequence of two developments. First, a “great diversity in&para;<br>practice among the courts” had emerged. Ibid. Second,&para;<br>“losing litigants were being unfairly saddled with exorbitant fees for the victor’s attorney.” Ibid. Against this&para;<br>backdrop, Congress passed the 1853 Fee Act, which we&para;<br>have described as a “far-reaching Act specifying in detail&para;<br>the nature and amount of the taxable items of cost in the&para;<br>federal courts.” Id., at 251–252. The substance of this Act&para;<br>was transmitted through the Revised Statutes of 1874&para;<br>and the Judicial Code of 1911 to the Revised Code of&para;<br>1948, where it was codified, “without any apparent intent to&para;<br>change the controlling rules,” as 28 U. S. C. §1920. 421&para;<br>U. S., at 255.&para;<br>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) gives courts the&para;<br>discretion to award costs to prevailing parties.

We have held that “§1920 defines&para;<br>the term ‘costs’ as used in Rule 54(d).” Crawford Fitting,&para;<br>482 U. S., at 441. In so doing, we rejected the view that&para;<br>“the discretion granted by Rule 54(d) is a separate source&para;<br>of power to tax as costs expenses not enumerated in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§1920.” Ibid.&para;<br>As originally configured, §1920 contained five categories&para;<br>of taxable costs: (1) “[f]ees of the clerk and marshal”; (2)&para;<br>“[f ]ees of the court reporter for all or any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the&para;<br>case”; (3) “[f]ees and disbursements for printing and witnesses”; (4) “[f]ees for exemplification and copies of papers&para;<br>necessarily obtained for use in the case”; and (5) “[d]ocket&para;<br>fees under section 1923 of this title.” 62 Stat. 955. In&para;<br>1978, Congress enacted the Court Interpreters Act, which&para;<br>amended §1920 to add a sixth category: “Compensation of&para;<br>court appointed experts, compensation of interpreters, and&para;<br>salaries, fees, expenses, and costs of special interpretation&para;<br>services under section 1828 of this title.” 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1920(6); see also §7, 92 Stat. 2044. We are concerned&para;<br>here with this sixth category, specifically the item of taxable costs identified as “compensation of interpreters.”&para;<br>B&para;<br>To determine whether the item “compensation of interpreters” includes costs for document translation, we must&para;<br>look to the meaning of “interpreter.” That term is not&para;<br>defined in the Court Interpreters Act or in any other&para;<br>relevant statutory provision. When a term goes undefined&para;<br>in a statute, we give the term its ordinary meaning. As­&para;<br>grow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995).&para;<br>The question here is: What is the ordinary meaning of&para;<br>“interpreter”?&para;<br>Many dictionaries in use when Congress enacted the&para;<br>Court Interpreters Act in 1978 defined “interpreter” as one&para;<br>who translates spoken, as opposed to written, language.&para;<br>The American Heritage Dictionary, for instance, defined&para;<br>the term as “[o]ne who translates orally from one language&para;<br>into another.” American Heritage Dictionary 685 (1978).&para;<br>The Scribner-Bantam English Dictionary defined the&para;<br>related word “interpret” as “to translate orally.” Scribner-&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Bantam English Dictionary 476 (1977). Similarly, the&para;<br>Random House Dictionary defined the intransitive form of&para;<br>“interpret” as “to translate what is said in a foreign language.” Random House Dictionary of the English Language 744 (1973) (emphasis added). And, notably, the&para;<br>Oxford English Dictionary defined “interpreter” as “[o]ne&para;<br>who translates languages,” but then divided that definition into two senses: “a. [a] translator of books or writings,” which it designated as obsolete, and “b. [o]ne who&para;<br>translates the communications of persons speaking different languages; spec. one whose office it is to do so orally in&para;<br>the presence of the persons; a dragoman.” 5 Oxford English Dictionary 416 (1933); see also Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English 566 (6th ed. 1976) (“One who&para;<br>interprets; one whose office it is to translate the words of&para;<br>persons speaking different languages, esp. orally in their&para;<br>presence”); Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary 686&para;<br>(1973) (“one who translates orally for the benefit of two or&para;<br>more parties speaking different languages: . . . a translator (obs.)”).&para;<br>Pre-1978 legal dictionaries also generally defined the&para;<br>words “interpreter” and “interpret” in terms of oral translation. The then-current edition of Black’s Law Dictionary, for example, defined “interpreter” as “[a] person&para;<br>sworn at a trial to interpret the evidence of a foreigner . . .&para;<br>to the court,” and it defined “interpret” in relevant part as&para;<br>“to translate orally from one tongue to another.” Black’s&para;<br>Law Dictionary 954, 953 (rev. 4th ed. 1968); see also&para;<br>W. Anderson, A Dictionary of Law 565 (1888) (“One who&para;<br>translates the testimony of witnesses speaking a foreign&para;<br>tongue, for the benefit of the court and jury”); 1 B. Abbott,&para;<br>Dictionary of Terms and Phrases Used in American or&para;<br>English Jurisprudence 639 (1878) (“one who restates the&para;<br>testimony of a witness testifying in a foreign tongue, to the&para;<br>court and jury, in their language”). But see Ballentine’s&para;<br>Law Dictionary 655, 654 (3d ed. 1969) (defining “inter-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>preter” as “[o]ne who interprets, particularly one who&para;<br>interprets words written or spoken in a foreign language,”&para;<br>and “interpret” as “to translate from a foreign language”).&para;<br>Against these authorities, respondent relies almost&para;<br>exclusively on Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (hereinafter Webster’s Third). The version of that&para;<br>dictionary in print when Congress enacted the Court&para;<br>Interpreters Act defined “interpreter” as “one that translates; esp: a person who translates orally for parties conversing in different tongues.”&para;<br>Webster’s Third 1182&para;<br>(1976).2 The sense divider esp (for especially) indicates&para;<br>that the most common meaning of the term is one “who&para;<br>translates orally,” but that meaning is subsumed within&para;<br>the more general definition “one that translates.” See&para;<br>12,000 Words: A Supplement to Webster’s Third 15a&para;<br>(1986) (explaining that esp “is used to introduce the most&para;<br>common meaning included in the more general preceding&para;<br>definition”). For respondent, the general definition suffices to establish that the term “interpreter” ordinarily&para;<br>includes persons who translate the written word. Explaining that “the word ‘interpreter’ can reasonably encompass&para;<br>a ‘translator,’ ” the Court of Appeals reached the same&para;<br>conclusion. 633 F. 3d, at 1221. We disagree.&para;<br>That a definition is broad enough to encompass one&para;<br>sense of a word does not establish that the word is ordi­&para;<br>narily understood in that sense. See Mallard v. United&para;<br>States Dist. Court for Southern Dist. of Iowa, 490 U. S.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 A handful of other contemporaneous dictionaries used a similar&para;<br>formulation. See Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Comprehensive International&para;<br>Dictionary of the English Language 665 (1977) (“One who interprets or&para;<br>translates; specifically, one who serves as oral translator between&para;<br>people speaking different languages”); 1 World Book Dictionary 1103&para;<br>(C. Barnhart &amp; R. Barnhart eds. 1977) (“a person whose business is&para;<br>translating, especially orally, from a foreign language”); Cassell’s&para;<br>English Dictionary 617 (4th ed. 1969) (“One who interprets, esp. one&para;<br>employed to translate orally to persons speaking a foreign language”).&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>296, 301 (1989) (relying on the “most common meaning”&para;<br>and the “ordinary and natural signification” of the word&para;<br>“request,” even though it may sometimes “double for ‘demand’ or ‘command’ ”). The fact that the definition of&para;<br>“interpreter” in Webster’s Third has a sense divider denoting the most common usage suggests that other usages,&para;<br>although acceptable, might not be common or ordinary. It&para;<br>is telling that all the dictionaries cited above defined&para;<br>“interpreter” at the time of the statute’s enactment as&para;<br>including persons who translate orally, but only a handful&para;<br>defined the word broadly enough to encompass translators&para;<br>of written material. See supra, at 5–7. Although the&para;<br>Oxford English Dictionary, one of the most authoritative&para;<br>on the English language, recognized that “interpreter” can&para;<br>mean one who translates writings, it expressly designated&para;<br>that meaning as obsolete. See supra, at 6. Were the&para;<br>meaning of “interpreter” that respondent advocates truly&para;<br>common or ordinary, we would expect to see more support&para;<br>for that meaning. We certainly would not expect to see it&para;<br>designated as obsolete in the Oxford English Dictionary.&para;<br>Any definition of a word that is absent from many dictionaries and is deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common&para;<br>or ordinary meaning.&para;<br>Based on our survey of the relevant dictionaries, we&para;<br>conclude that the ordinary or common meaning of “interpreter” does not include those who translate writings.&para;<br>Instead, we find that an interpreter is normally understood as one who translates orally from one language to&para;<br>another. This sense of the word is far more natural. As&para;<br>the Seventh Circuit put it: “Robert Fagles made famous&para;<br>translations into English of the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the&para;<br>Aeneid, but no one would refer to him as an Englishlanguage ‘interpreter’ of these works.” Extra Equipamen­&para;<br>tos E Exportação Ltda. v.

Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act or in §1920,&para;<br>however, even hints that Congress intended to go beyond&para;<br>the ordinary meaning of “interpreter” and to embrace the&para;<br>broadest possible meaning that the definition of the word&para;<br>can bear.&para;<br>If anything, the statutory context suggests the opposite:&para;<br>that the word “interpreter” applies only to those who&para;<br>translate orally. As previously mentioned, Congress enacted §1920(6) as part of the Court Interpreters Act.&para;<br>The main provision of that Act is §2(a), codified in 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §§1827 and 1828. See 92 Stat. 2040–2042. Particularly relevant here is §1827. As it now reads, that&para;<br>statute provides for the establishment of “a program to&para;<br>facilitate the use of certified and otherwise qualified interpreters in judicial proceedings instituted by the United&para;<br>States.” §1827(a). Subsection (d) directs courts to use an&para;<br>interpreter in any criminal or civil action instituted by the&para;<br>United States if a party or witness “speaks only or primarily a language other than the English language” or “suffers&para;<br>from a hearing impairment” “so as to inhibit such party’s&para;<br>comprehension of the proceedings or communication with&para;<br>counsel or the presiding judicial officer, or so as to inhibit&para;<br>such witness’ comprehension of questions and the presentation of such testimony.” §1827(d)(1).3 As originally&para;<br>enacted, subsection (k) mandated that the “interpretation&para;<br>provided by certified interpreters . . . shall be in the consecutive mode except that the presiding judicial officer . . .&para;<br>may authorize a simultaneous or summary interpretation.” §1827(k) (1976 ed., Supp. II); see also 92 Stat. 2042.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 This provision remains substantially the same as it appeared when&para;<br>first enacted.

The practice of federal courts after the Act’s&para;<br>enactment tells us nothing about what Congress intended at the time of&para;<br>enactment. And federal court practice before the Act under other&para;<br>provisions of §1920 tells us little, if anything, about what Congress&para;<br>intended when it added subsection (6). We think the statutory context&para;<br>in which the word “interpreter” appears is a more reliable guide to its&para;<br>meaning.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

Herbert,&para;<br>Interpreter’s Handbook 1 (2d ed. 1952) (“In the presentday jargon of international organisations, the words translate, translations, translator are used when the immediate&para;<br>result of the work is a written text; and the words interpret, interpreter, interpretation when it is a speech delivered orally”). That Congress specified “interpreters” but&para;<br>not “translators” is yet another signal that it intended to&para;<br>limit §1920(6) to the costs of oral, instead of written,&para;<br>translation.6&para;<br>In sum, both the ordinary and technical meanings of&para;<br>“interpreter,” as well as the statutory context in which the&para;<br>word is found, lead to the conclusion that §1920(6) does&para;<br>not apply to translators of written materials.7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Some&para;<br>&para;<br>provisions within the United States Code use both “interpreter” and “translator” together, thus implying that Congress understands the terms to have the distinct meanings described above. See,&para;<br>e.g., 8 U. S. C. §1555(b) (providing that appropriations for the Immigration and Naturalization Service “shall be available for payment of . . .&para;<br>interpreters and translators who are not citizens of the United States”);&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §530C(b)(1)(I) (providing that Department of Justice funds&para;<br>may be used for “[p]ayment of interpreters and translators who are not&para;<br>citizens of the United States”).&para;<br>7 Our conclusion is buttressed by respondent’s concession at oral argument that there is no provision in the United States Code where it is&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>C&para;<br>No other rule of construction compels us to depart from&para;<br>the ordinary meaning of “interpreter.” The Court of Appeals reasoned that a broader meaning is “more compatible with Rule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,&para;<br>which includes a decided preference for the award of costs&para;<br>to the prevailing party.” 633 F. 3d, at 1221. But we have&para;<br>never held that Rule 54(d) creates a presumption of statutory construction in favor of the broadest possible reading&para;<br>of the costs enumerated in §1920. To the contrary, we&para;<br>have made clear that the “discretion granted by Rule 54(d)&para;<br>is not a power to evade” the specific categories of costs set&para;<br>forth by Congress. Crawford Fitting, 482 U. S., at 442.&para;<br>“Rather,” we have said, “it is solely a power to decline to&para;<br>tax, as costs, the items enumerated in §1920.” Ibid. Rule&para;<br>54(d) thus provides no sound basis for casting aside the&para;<br>ordinary meaning of the various items enumerated in&para;<br>the costs statute, including the ordinary meaning of&para;<br>“interpreter.”&para;<br>Our decision is in keeping with the narrow scope of&para;<br>taxable costs. “Although ‘costs’ has an everyday meaning&para;<br>synonymous with ‘expenses,’ the concept of taxable costs&para;<br>under Rule 54(d) is more limited and represents those&para;<br>expenses, including, for example, court fees, that a court&para;<br>will assess against a litigant.” 10 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp;&para;<br>M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §2666, pp. 202–&para;<br>203 (3d ed. 1998) (hereinafter Wright &amp; Miller). Taxable&para;<br>costs are limited to relatively minor, incidental expenses&para;<br>as is evident from §1920, which lists such items as clerk&para;<br>——————&para;<br>clear that the word extends to those who translate documents. Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 39; see also Brief for Petitioner 32 (“And the Code is wholly&para;<br>devoid of any corresponding definition of ‘interpreter’ extending to the&para;<br>translation of written documents”). As respondent acknowledged,&para;<br>either the word is used in a context that strongly suggests it applies&para;<br>only to oral translation or its meaning is unclear.

Indeed, “the assessment of costs most often is merely a&para;<br>clerical matter that can be done by the court clerk.” Hair­&para;<br>line Creations, Inc. v. Kefalas, 664 F. 2d 652, 656 (CA7&para;<br>1981). Taxable costs are a fraction of the nontaxable&para;<br>expenses borne by litigants for attorneys, experts, consultants, and investigators. It comes as little surprise, therefore, that “costs almost always amount to less than the&para;<br>successful litigant’s total expenses in connection with a&para;<br>lawsuit.” 10 Wright &amp; Miller §2666, at 203. Because&para;<br>taxable costs are limited by statute and are modest in&para;<br>scope, we see no compelling reason to stretch the ordinary&para;<br>meaning of the cost items Congress authorized in §1920.&para;<br>As for respondent’s extratextual arguments, they are&para;<br>more properly directed at Congress. Respondent contends&para;<br>that documentary evidence is no less important than&para;<br>testimonial evidence and that it would be anomalous to&para;<br>require the losing party to cover translation costs for&para;<br>spoken words but not for written words. Brief for Respondent 20. Respondent also observes that some translation tasks are not entirely oral or entirely written. Id., at&para;<br>20–24. One task, called “ ‘sight translation,’ ” involves the&para;<br>oral translation of a document. Id., at 21. Another task&para;<br>involves the written translation of speech. Ibid. And a&para;<br>third task, called “ ‘document comparison,’ ” involves comparing documents in the source and target language to&para;<br>verify that the two are identical. Id., at 21–22. Respondent argues that a narrow definition cannot account for&para;<br>these variations and that a bright-line definition of “interpreter” as someone who translates spoken and written&para;<br>words would avoid complication and provide a simple,&para;<br>administrable rule for district courts.&para;<br>Neither of these arguments convinces us that Congress&para;<br>must have intended to dispense with the ordinary mean-&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>TANIGUCHI v. KAN PACIFIC SAIPAN, LTD.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ing of “interpreter” in §1920(6). First, Congress might&para;<br>have distinguished between oral and written translation&para;<br>out of a concern that requiring losing parties to bear&para;<br>the potentially sizable costs of translating discovery documents, as opposed to the more limited costs of oral testimony, could be too burdensome and possibly unfair,&para;<br>especially for litigants with limited means. Cf. Fleischmann&para;<br>Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U. S. 714, 718&para;<br>(1967) (noting the argument “that since litigation is at&para;<br>best uncertain one should not be penalized for merely&para;<br>defending or prosecuting a lawsuit, and that the poor&para;<br>might be unjustly discouraged from instituting actions to&para;<br>vindicate their rights if the penalty for losing included the&para;<br>fees of their opponents’ counsel”). Congress might also&para;<br>have concluded that a document translator is more akin to&para;<br>an expert or consultant retained by a party to decipher&para;<br>documentary evidence—like, for instance, a forensic accountant—than to an interpreter whose real-time oral&para;<br>translation services are necessary for communication&para;<br>between litigants, witnesses, and the court.8&para;<br>Second, respondent has not shown that any of the hybrid translation/interpretation tasks to which it points&para;<br>actually arise with overwhelming frequency or that the&para;<br>problem of drawing the line between taxable and nontaxable costs in such cases will vex the trial courts. It certainly has not shown that any such problems will be more&para;<br>troublesome than the task of sifting through translated&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The dissent contends that document translation, no less than oral&para;<br>translation, is essential “to equip the parties to present their case&para;<br>clearly and the court to decide the merits intelligently.” Post, at 5. But&para;<br>a document translator is no more important than an expert or consultant in making sense of otherwise incomprehensible documentary&para;<br>evidence, yet expenses for experts and consultants are generally not&para;<br>taxable as costs. To be sure, forgoing document translation can impair&para;<br>a litigant’s case, but document translation is not indispensable, in the&para;<br>way oral translation is, to the parties’ ability to communicate with each&para;<br>other, with witnesses, and with the court.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

But if the interpreter&para;<br>then reads the prepared written translation aloud in&para;<br>court, that task, in Taniguchi’s view, can be charged as&para;<br>“interpretation,” id., at 11, even though the reading in­&para;<br>volves no translation of foreign-language expression—&para;<br>written or oral—at all.&para;<br>Similarly hard to categorize is the common court­&para;<br>interpreter task of listening to a recording in a foreign&para;<br>language, transcribing it, then translating it into English. See González 439. Although this task involves oral&para;<br>foreign-language communication, it does not, Taniguchi&para;<br>contends, qualify as “interpretation,” because it involves&para;<br>“the luxury of multiple playbacks of the tape and the&para;<br>leisure to consult extrinsic linguistic sources.” Reply Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 9 (internal quotation marks omitted). But&para;<br>sight translation—which Taniguchi concedes may be&para;<br>charged as “interpretation”—may sometimes involve sim­&para;<br>ilarly careful linguistic analysis of a written document&para;<br>in advance of a court proceeding.

The tab for unquestionably&para;<br>allowable costs, however, may run high. See, e.g., In re Ricoh Co., Ltd.&para;<br>Patent Litigation, No. C 03–02289, 2012 WL 1499191, *6 (ND Cal., Apr.&para;<br>26, 2012) (awarding $440,000 in copying costs); Jones v.

Translation&para;<br>costs, on the other hand, are not inevitably large. See Brief for Re­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

See Eastman Kodak Co.,&para;<br>713 F. 2d, at 133 (district court should not award docu­&para;<br>ment translation costs “carte blanche,” but must deter­&para;<br>mine whether such costs were necessarily incurred).
