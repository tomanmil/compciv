As amended, the Act man&para;<br>dates arbitration of “minor disputes” before panels composed of two&para;<br>representatives of labor and two of industry, with a neutral referee as&para;<br>tiebreaker. Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, 360 U. S. 601, 610–613. To&para;<br>supply arbitrators, Congress established the National Railroad Ad&para;<br>justment Board (NRAB or Board), a board of 34 private persons rep&para;<br>resenting labor and industry in equal numbers. 45 U. S. C. §153&para;<br>First (a). Before resorting to arbitration, employees and carriers&para;<br>must exhaust the grievance procedures in their collective-bargaining&para;<br>agreement (hereinafter CBA), see §153 First (i), a stage known as&para;<br>“on-property” proceedings. As a final prearbitration step, the parties&para;<br>must attempt settlement “in conference” between representatives of&para;<br>the carrier and the grievant-employee. §152 Second, Sixth. The RLA&para;<br>contains instructions concerning the place and time of conferences,&para;<br>but does not “supersede the provisions of any agreement (as to con&para;<br>ferences) . . . between the parties,” §152 Sixth; in common practice&para;<br>the conference may be as informal as a telephone conversation. If the&para;<br>parties fail to achieve resolution, either may refer the matter to the&para;<br>NRAB. §153 First (i). Submissions to the Board must include “a full&para;<br>statement of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the dis&para;<br>putes.” Ibid. Parties may seek court review of an NRAB panel order&para;<br>on one or more stated grounds: “failure . . . to comply with the re&para;<br>quirements of [the RLA], . . . failure of the order to conform, or con&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND&para;<br>TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>fine itself, to matters within the scope of the division’s jurisdiction, or&para;<br>. . . fraud or corruption by a member of the division making the or&para;<br>der.” §153 First (q). Courts of Appeals have divided on whether, in&para;<br>addition to the statutory grounds for judicial review stated in §153&para;<br>First (q), courts may review NRAB proceedings for due process viola&para;<br>tions.&para;<br>After petitioner Union Pacific Railroad Co. (hereinafter Carrier)&para;<br>charged five of its employees with disciplinary violations, their union&para;<br>(hereinafter Union) initiated grievance proceedings pursuant to the&para;<br>CBA. The Union asserts that the parties conferenced all five dis&para;<br>putes and the Carrier concedes that they conferenced at least two.&para;<br>Dissatisfied with the outcome of the on-property proceedings, the Un&para;<br>ion sought arbitration before the NRAB’s First Division. Both parties&para;<br>filed submissions in the five cases, but neither mentioned conferenc&para;<br>ing as a disputed matter. Yet, in each case, both parties necessarily&para;<br>knew whether the Union and the Carrier had conferred; and the&para;<br>Board’s governing rule, published in Circular One, which prescribes&para;<br>Board procedures, instructs carriers and employees to “set forth all&para;<br>relevant, argumentative facts,” 29 CFR §301.5(d), (e). Just prior to&para;<br>the hearing, one of the arbitration panel’s industry representatives&para;<br>objected, sua sponte, that the on-property record included no proof of&para;<br>conferencing. The Carrier thereafter embraced that objection. The&para;<br>referee allowed the Union to submit evidence of conferencing. The&para;<br>Union did so, but it maintained that the proof-of-conferencing issue&para;<br>was untimely raised, indeed forfeited, as the Carrier had not objected&para;<br>before the date set for argument. The panel, in five identical deci&para;<br>sions, dismissed the petitions for want of jurisdiction. The record&para;<br>could not be supplemented to meet the no-proof-of-conferencing objec&para;<br>tion, the panel reasoned, for as an appellate tribunal, the panel was&para;<br>not empowered to consider de novo evidence and arguments. The Un&para;<br>ion sought review in the Federal District Court, which affirmed the&para;<br>Board’s decision. On appeal, the Seventh Circuit observed that the&para;<br>“single question” at issue was whether written documentation of the&para;<br>conference in the on-property record was a necessary prerequisite to&para;<br>NRAB arbitration, and determined that there was no such prerequi&para;<br>site in the statute or rules. But instead of resting its decision on the&para;<br>Union’s primary, statute-based argument—that the panel erred in&para;<br>ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over the cases—it reversed on the&para;<br>ground that the NRAB’s proceedings were incompatible with due&para;<br>process.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The Seventh Circuit erred in resolving the Union’s appeal under&para;<br>a constitutional, rather than a statutory, headline. This Court&para;<br>granted certiorari to address whether NRAB orders may be set aside&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>for failure to comply with due process notwithstanding §153 First&para;<br>(q)’s limited grounds for review. But so long as a respondent does not&para;<br>“seek to modify the judgment below,” true here, the respondent may&para;<br>“rely upon any matter appearing in the record in support of the&para;<br>judgment.” Blum v. Bacon, 457 U. S. 132, 137, n. 5. The Seventh&para;<br>Circuit understood that the Union had pressed “statutory and consti&para;<br>tutional” arguments, but observed that both arguments homed in on&para;<br>a “single question”: is written documentation of the conference in the&para;<br>on-property record a necessary prerequisite to NRAB arbitration?&para;<br>Answering this “single question” in the negative, the Seventh Circuit&para;<br>effectively resolved the Union’s core complaint. Because nothing in&para;<br>the Act elevates to jurisdictional status the obligation to conference&para;<br>minor disputes or to prove conferencing, a negative answer to the&para;<br>“single question” leaves no doubt about the Union’s entitlement, in&para;<br>accord with §153 First (q), to vacation of the Board’s orders. Given&para;<br>this statutory ground for relief, there is no due process issue alive in&para;<br>this case, and no warrant to answer a question that may be conse&para;<br>quential in another case. Nevertheless, the grant of certiorari here&para;<br>enables this Court to reduce confusion, clouding court as well as&para;<br>Board decisions, over matters properly typed “jurisdictional.” Pp. 10–&para;<br>12.&para;<br>2. Congress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for presenting&para;<br>and processing claims, §153 First (v), but Congress alone controls the&para;<br>Board’s jurisdiction. By refusing to adjudicate the instant cases on&para;<br>the false premise that it lacked “jurisdiction” to hear them, the NRAB&para;<br>panel failed “to conform, or confine itself, to matters [Congress&para;<br>placed] within the scope of [NRAB] jurisdiction,” §153 First (q).&para;<br>Pp. 12–17.&para;<br>(a) Not all mandatory “prescriptions, however emphatic, ‘are . . .&para;<br>properly typed “jurisdictional.” ’ ” Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., 546 U. S.&para;<br>500, 510. Subject-matter jurisdiction properly comprehended refers&para;<br>to a tribunal’s “ ‘power to hear a case,’ ” and “ ‘can never be forfeited or&para;<br>waived.’ ” Id., at 514. In contrast, a “claim-processing rule” does not&para;<br>reduce a tribunal’s adjudicatory domain and is ordinarily “forfeited if&para;<br>the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.” Kon&para;<br>trick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 456. For example, this Court has held&para;<br>nonjurisdictional and forfeitable the provision in Title VII of the Civil&para;<br>Rights Act of 1964 requiring complainants to file a timely discrimina&para;<br>tion charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&para;<br>(EEOC) before proceeding to court, Zipes v. Trans World Airlines,&para;<br>Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 393. In contrast, the Court has reaffirmed the ju&para;<br>risdictional character of 28 U. S. C. §2107(a)’s time limitation for fil&para;<br>ing a notice of appeal. Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 209–211.&para;<br>Here, the requirement that parties to minor disputes, as a last&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND&para;<br>TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>chance prearbitration, attempt settlement “in conference,” is imposed&para;<br>on carriers and grievants alike, but satisfaction of that obligation&para;<br>does not condition the Board’s adjudicatory authority, which extends&para;<br>to “all disputes between carriers and their employees ‘growing out of&para;<br>grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements&para;<br>concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions . . . ,’ ” Slocum v.&para;<br>Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co., 339 U. S. 239, 240 (quoting §153 First (i)).&para;<br>When a CBA’s grievance procedure has not been followed, resort to&para;<br>the Board would ordinarily be objectionable as premature, but the&para;<br>conference requirement is independent of the CBA process. Rooted in&para;<br>§152, the RLA’s “[g]eneral duties” section, and not moored to the&para;<br>NRAB’s “[e]stablishment[,] . . . powers[,] and duties” set out in §153&para;<br>First, conferencing is often informal in practice, and is no more “ju&para;<br>risdictional” than is the presuit resort to the EEOC held nonjurisdic&para;<br>tional and forfeitable in Zipes. And if the conference requirement is&para;<br>not “jurisdictional,” then failure initially to submit proof of conferenc&para;<br>ing cannot be of that genre. And although the Carrier alleges that&para;<br>NRAB decisions support characterizing conferencing as jurisdic&para;<br>tional, if the NRAB lacks authority to define its panels’ jurisdiction,&para;<br>surely the panels themselves lack that authority. Furthermore,&para;<br>NRAB panels have variously addressed the matter. Pp. 12–15.&para;<br>(b) Neither the RLA nor Circular One could plausibly be read to&para;<br>require, as a prerequisite to the NRAB’s exercise of jurisdiction, sub&para;<br>mission of proof of conferencing. Instructions on party submissions&para;<br>are claim-processing, not jurisdictional, rules. The Board itself has&para;<br>recognized that conferencing may not be a “question in dispute,” and&para;<br>when that is so, proof thereof need not accompany party submissions.&para;<br>It makes sense to exclude at the arbitration stage newly presented&para;<br>“data” supporting the employee’s grievance, 29 CFR §301(d)—&para;<br>evidence the carrier had no opportunity to consider prearbitration.&para;<br>But conferencing is not a fact bearing on the merits of a grievance.&para;<br>Moreover, the RLA respects the parties’ right to order for themselves&para;<br>the conference procedures they will follow.

C. §153&para;<br>First (h), (i). We consider in this case five nearly identical&para;<br>decisions of a panel of the NRAB dismissing employee&para;<br>claims “for lack of jurisdiction.” NRAB First Div. Award&para;<br>No. 26089 etc. (Mar. 15, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>65a–107a, 69a (hereinafter Panel Decision). In each case,&para;<br>the panel declared that a procedural rule raised by a&para;<br>panel member, unprompted by the parties, was “jurisdic­&para;<br>tional” in character and therefore commanded threshold&para;<br>dismissal.&para;<br>The panel’s characterization, we hold, was misconceived.&para;<br>Congress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for the&para;<br>presentation and processing of claims, §153 First (v), but&para;<br>Congress alone controls the Board’s jurisdiction. By pre­&para;<br>suming authority to declare procedural rules “jurisdic­&para;<br>tional,” the panel failed “to conform, or confine itself, to&para;<br>matters [Congress placed] within the scope of [NRAB]&para;<br>jurisdiction,” §153 First (q). Because the panel was not&para;<br>“without authority to assume jurisdiction over the [em­&para;<br>ployees’] claim[s],” Panel Decision 72a, its dismissals&para;<br>lacked tenable grounding. We therefore affirm the judg­&para;<br>ment of the Seventh Circuit setting aside the panel’s&para;<br>orders.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Concerned that labor disputes would lead to strikes&para;<br>bringing railroads to a halt, Congress enacted the Railway&para;<br>Labor Act (RLA or Act), 44 Stat. 577, as amended, 45&para;<br>U.

Jacksonville Terminal Co.,&para;<br>394 U. S. 369, 377–378 (1969) (describing obligation to&para;<br>pursue agreement as the “heart of the [RLA]”). As part of&para;<br>its endeavor, Congress provided a framework for the&para;<br>settlement and voluntary arbitration of “minor disputes.”&para;<br>See Price, 360 U. S., at 609–610. (In the railroad industry,&para;<br>the term “minor disputes” means, primarily, “grievances&para;<br>arising from the application of collective bargaining&para;<br>agreements to particular situations.” Id., at 609.)1&para;<br>Many railroads, however, resisted voluntary arbitration.&para;<br>See id., at 610. Congress therefore amended the Act in&para;<br>1934 (1934 Amendment) to mandate arbitration of minor&para;<br>disputes; under the altered scheme, arbitration occurs&para;<br>before panels composed of two representatives of labor and&para;<br>two of industry, with a neutral referee serving as tie­&para;<br>breaker. See id., at 610–613. To supply the representa­&para;<br>tive arbitrators, Congress established the NRAB, a board&para;<br>of 34 private persons representing labor and industry in&para;<br>equal numbers. §153 First (a); see Trainmen v.

The Union asserts that, following&para;<br>exhaustion of grievance proceedings, the parties confer­&para;<br>enced all the disputes; counsel for the Carrier conceded at&para;<br>argument that at least two of the disputes were confer­&para;<br>enced, Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. Dissatisfied with the outcome of&para;<br>the on-property proceedings, the Union sought arbitration&para;<br>before the First Division of the NRAB. The Union and the&para;<br>Carrier, from early 2002 through 2003, filed simultaneous&para;<br>submissions in the five cases. In each submission, the&para;<br>Union included the notice of discipline (or discharge), the&para;<br>hearing transcript, and all exhibits and evidence relating&para;<br>to the underlying adverse actions used in the grievance&para;<br>proceeding. Neither party mentioned conferencing as a&para;<br>disputed matter. Yet, in each case, both parties necessar­&para;<br>ily knew whether the Union and the Carrier had con­&para;<br>ferred, and the Board’s governing rule instructs carriers&para;<br>and employees to “set forth all relevant, argumentative&para;<br>facts,” 29 CFR §301.5(d), (e).&para;<br>On March 18, 2004, just prior to the hearing on the&para;<br>employees’ claims, one of the industry representatives on&para;<br>the arbitration panel raised an objection.

On his own initiative, unprompted by the&para;<br>Carrier, and in executive session, the industry representa­&para;<br>tive asserted that the on-property record included no proof&para;<br>of conferencing. See ibid. The Carrier thereafter em­&para;<br>braced the panel member’s objection. The neutral referee&para;<br>informed the Union of the issue and adjourned the hear­&para;<br>ing, allowing the Union “to submit evidence that confer­&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNION PACIFIC R.

E.g., Panel Decision 67a–68a.&para;<br>From its first notice of the objection, however, the Union&para;<br>maintained that the proof-of-conferencing issue was un­&para;<br>timely raised, indeed forfeited, as the Carrier itself had&para;<br>not objected prior to the date set for argument of the cases.&para;<br>E.g., id., at 67a; Pet. to Review ¶¶22, 29, 30, 54.&para;<br>On March 15, 2005, nearly one year after the question of&para;<br>conferencing first arose, the panel, in five identical deci­&para;<br>sions, dismissed the petitions for want of “authority to&para;<br>assume jurisdiction over the claim[s].” Panel Decision&para;<br>72a. Citing Circular One, see supra, at 3–4, and “the&para;<br>weight of arbitral precedent,” the panel stated that “the&para;<br>evidentiary record” must be deemed “closed once a Notice&para;<br>of Intent has been filed with the NRAB . . . .” Panel Deci­&para;<br>sion 71a.5 In explaining why the record could not be sup­&para;<br>plemented to meet the no-proof-of-conferencing objection,&para;<br>the panel emphasized that it was “an appellate tribunal,&para;<br>as opposed to one which is empowered to consider and rule&para;<br>on de novo evidence and arguments.” Id., at 69a.&para;<br>The two labor representatives dissented. The Carrier’s&para;<br>submissions, they reasoned, took no exception based on&para;<br>failure to conference or to prove conferencing; therefore,&para;<br>they concluded, under a “well settled principle governing&para;<br>the Board’s deliberations,” the Carrier had forfeited the&para;<br>issue. Id., at 105a–106a. The dissenters urged that the&para;<br>Union had furnished evidence showing “the cases had all&para;<br>been conferenced, even though the relevant Collective&para;<br>Bargaining Agreement [did] not require [conferencing].”&para;<br>Id., at 105a.

Nothing in the&para;<br>Act or the NRAB’s procedural rules, the Union main­&para;<br>tained, mandated dismissal for failure to allege and prove&para;<br>conferencing in the Union’s original submission. Id., ¶¶3,&para;<br>4. By imposing, without warrant, “a technical pleading or&para;<br>evidentiary requirement” and elevating it to jurisdictional&para;<br>status, the Union charged, the panel had “egregiously&para;<br>violate[d] the Act,” id., ¶3, or “fail[ed] to conform its juris­&para;<br>diction to that required by . . . law,” id., ¶4. Alternatively,&para;<br>the Union asserted that the panel violated procedural due&para;<br>process by entertaining the Carrier’s untimely objection,&para;<br>even though “the Carrier had failed to raise any objection&para;<br>as to lack of conferencing” in its submissions. Id., ¶5.&para;<br>The District Court affirmed the Board’s orders. Ad­&para;<br>dressing the Union’s argument that the no-proof-of­&para;<br>conferencing issue was untimely raised, the court accepted&para;<br>the panel’s description of the issue as “jurisdictional,” and&para;<br>noted the familiar proposition that jurisdictional chal­&para;<br>lenges may be raised at any stage of the proceedings. 432&para;<br>F.

It then determined that there was no such prerequi­&para;<br>site: “[N]o statute, regulation, or CBA,” the court con­&para;<br>cluded, “required the evidence [of conferencing] to be&para;<br>presented in the on-property record.” Id., at 757–758. But&para;<br>instead of resting its decision on the Union’s primary,&para;<br>statute-based argument—that the panel erred in ruling&para;<br>that it lacked jurisdiction over the cases—the Court of&para;<br>Appeals reversed on the ground that the NRAB’s proceed­&para;<br>ings were incompatible with due process. See id., at 750.&para;<br>II&para;<br>We granted the Carrier’s petition for certiorari, 555&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2009), which asked us to determine whether a&para;<br>reviewing court may set aside NRAB orders for failure to&para;<br>comply with due process notwithstanding the limited&para;<br>grounds for review specified in §153 First (q).6 As earlier&para;<br>recounted, Courts of Appeals have divided on this issue.&para;<br>See supra, at 6, and n. 4. Appearing as respondent in this&para;<br>Court, however, the Union urged affirmance of the Sev­&para;<br>enth Circuit’s judgment on an alternative ground. Reas­&para;<br>serting the lead argument it had advanced in its petition&para;<br>for court review, see supra, at 9, the Union maintained&para;<br>that the Board did not “conform, or confine itself, to mat­&para;<br>ters within the scope of [its] jurisdiction,” §153 First (q).&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 52–53. In response, the Carrier&para;<br>stated that the Union’s alternative ground “presents a&para;<br>pure question of law that th[e] Court can and should&para;<br>resolve without need for remand.” Reply Brief 24, n. 9.&para;<br>We agree.&para;<br>So long as a respondent does not “seek to modify the&para;<br>judgment below,” true here, “[i]t is well accepted” that the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Quoted supra, at 6, those grounds are “failure of the division to&para;<br>comply with [RLA] requirements,” “failure of the order to conform, or&para;<br>confine itself, to matters within the scope of the division’s jurisdiction,”&para;<br>and “fraud or corruption by a member of the division making the&para;<br>order.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>respondent may, “without filing a cross-appeal or cross­&para;<br>petition, . . . rely upon any matter appearing in the record&para;<br>in support of the judgment.” Blum v. Bacon, 457 U. S.&para;<br>132, 137, n. 5 (1982). The Seventh Circuit, as just ob­&para;<br>served, see supra, at 9–10, understood that the Union had&para;<br>pressed “statutory and constitutional” arguments, but also&para;<br>comprehended that both arguments homed in on “a single&para;<br>question: is written documentation of the conference in the&para;<br>on-property record a necessary prerequisite to arbitration&para;<br>before the NRAB?” 522 F. 3d, at 750. Answering this&para;<br>“single question” in the negative, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>effectively resolved the Union’s core complaint. But, for&para;<br>reasons far from apparent, the court declared that “once&para;<br>we answer the key question . . . , adjudication of the due&para;<br>process claim is unavoidable.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Seventh Circuit, we agree, asked the right question,&para;<br>but inappropriately placed its answer under a constitu­&para;<br>tional, rather than a statutory, headline. As the Court of&para;<br>Appeals determined, and as we discuss infra, at 12–17,&para;<br>nothing in the Act elevates to jurisdictional status the&para;<br>obligation to conference minor disputes or to prove confer­&para;<br>encing. That being so, the “unavoidable” conclusion,&para;<br>following from the Seventh Circuit’s “answer [to] the key&para;<br>question,” 522 F. 3d, at 750, is that the panel, in §153&para;<br>First (q)’s words, failed “to conform, or confine itself, to&para;<br>matters within the scope of [its] jurisdiction.” The Carrier,&para;<br>although it sought a different outcome, was quite right to&para;<br>“urg[e] [the Court of Appeals] to consider the statutory&para;<br>claim before the constitutional one.” 522 F. 3d, at 750.&para;<br>In short, a negative answer to the “single question”&para;<br>identified by the Court of Appeals leaves no doubt about&para;<br>the Union’s entitlement, in accord with §153 First (q), to&para;<br>vacation of the Board’s orders. Given this statutory&para;<br>ground for relief, there is no due process issue alive in this&para;<br>case, and no warrant to answer a question that may be&para;<br>consequential in another case: Absent grounds specified in&para;<br>&para;<br>12 UNION PACIFIC R.

OF ADJUSTMENT &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>§153 First (q) for vacating a Board order, may a reviewing&para;<br>court set aside an NRAB adjudication for incompatibility&para;<br>with due process? An answer to that question must await&para;<br>a case in which the issue is genuinely in controversy.7 In&para;<br>this case, however, our grant of certiorari enables us to&para;<br>address a matter of some importance: We can reduce&para;<br>confusion, clouding court as well as Board decisions, over&para;<br>matters properly typed “jurisdictional.”&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Recognizing that the word “jurisdiction” has been used&para;<br>by courts, including this Court, to convey “many, too&para;<br>many, meanings,” Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environ&para;<br>ment, 523 U. S. 83, 90 (1998) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted), we have cautioned, in recent decisions, against&para;<br>profligate use of the term. Not all mandatory “prescrip­&para;<br>tions, however emphatic, are . . . properly typed jurisdic­&para;<br>tional,” we explained in Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., 546 U. S.&para;<br>500, 510 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Sub­&para;<br>ject-matter jurisdiction properly comprehended, we em­&para;<br>phasized, refers to a tribunal’s “power to hear a case,” a&para;<br>matter that “can never be forfeited or waived.” Id., at 514&para;<br>(quoting United States v. Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 630&para;<br>(2002)). In contrast, a “claim-processing rule, . . . even if&para;<br>unalterable on a party’s application,” does not reduce the&para;<br>adjudicatory domain of a tribunal and is ordinarily “for­&para;<br>feited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise&para;<br>the point.” Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 456 (2004).&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 A case of that order would be uncommon. As the Carrier acknowl­&para;<br>edges, “many of the cases reviewing ostensibly extra-statutory due&para;<br>process objections could have been accommodated within the statutory&para;<br>framework.” Brief for Petitioner 36. See also id., at 37 (“The statutory&para;<br>review provisions are plainly generous enough to permit litigants to&para;<br>raise all of the simple, common, easily adjudicated, and likely to be&para;<br>meritorious claims that sail under the flag of due process of law . . . .”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

See supra, at 4–5, and n. 3.&para;<br>This obligation is imposed on carriers and grievants alike&para;<br>but, we hold, its satisfaction does not condition the adjudi­&para;<br>catory authority of the Board.&para;<br>The Board’s jurisdiction extends to “all disputes between&para;<br>carriers and their employees ‘growing out of grievances or&para;<br>out of the interpretation or application of agreements&para;<br>concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions . . . .’ ”&para;<br>Slocum v. Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co., 339 U. S. 239, 240&para;<br>(1950) (quoting §153 First (i)).

And&para;<br>when the CBA’s grievance procedure has not been fol­&para;<br>lowed, resort to the Board would ordinarily be objection­&para;<br>able as premature.&para;<br>The additional requirement of a conference, we note, is&para;<br>independent of the CBA process. Rather, the conference&para;<br>requirement is stated in the “[g]eneral duties” section of&para;<br>the RLA, §152, a section that is not moored to the&para;<br>“[e]stablishment[,] . . . powers[,] and duties” of the NRAB&para;<br>set out next in §153 First. Rooted in §152 and often in­&para;<br>formal in practice, see supra, at 4–5, conferencing is surely&para;<br>no more “jurisdictional” than is the presuit resort to the&para;<br>EEOC held forfeitable in Zipes, 455 U. S., at 393.8 And if&para;<br>the requirement to conference is not “jurisdictional,” then&para;<br>failure initially to submit proof of conferencing cannot be&para;<br>of that genre. See Part III–B, infra.&para;<br>In defense of the Board’s characterization of conferenc­&para;<br>ing and proof thereof as jurisdictional, the Carrier points&para;<br>to the NRAB’s Circular One procedural regulations, see&para;<br>supra, at 3–4, which provide: “No petition shall be consid­&para;<br>ered by any division of the Board unless the subject mat­&para;<br>ter has been handled in accordance with the provisions of&para;<br>the [RLA].” 29 CFR §301.2(b). But that provision, as&para;<br>other prescriptions in Circular One, is a claims-processing&para;<br>rule. Congress gave the Board no authority to adopt rules&para;<br>of jurisdictional dimension.

They also apply to disputes in the airline industry, over which&para;<br>the NRAB has no jurisdiction. §181. Neither provision “speak[s] in&para;<br>jurisdictional terms or refer[s] in any way to the jurisdiction of the”&para;<br>NRAB. Zipes, 455 U. S., at 394.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

Circular&para;<br>One does not exclude such a sensible solution.&para;<br>The Carrier cites NRAB decisions that allegedly support&para;<br>characterization of conferencing as jurisdictional. If the&para;<br>NRAB lacks authority to define the jurisdiction of its&para;<br>panels, however, surely the panels themselves lack that&para;<br>authority. Furthermore, NRAB panels have variously&para;<br>addressed the matter. For example, in NRAB Third Div.&para;<br>Award No. 15880 (Oct. 26, 1967), the panel, although&para;<br>characterizing the conferencing requirement as “jurisdic­&para;<br>tional,” said that “[i]f one of the parties refuses or fails to&para;<br>avail itself of a conference where there is an opportunity to&para;<br>do so, it cannot then assert the defense of a lack of juris­&para;<br>diction.” Id., at 2. See also NRAB Fourth Div. Award No.&para;<br>5074 (June 21, 2001) (same); NRAB Third Div. Award No.&para;<br>28147 (Oct. 16, 1989) (same). Cf. Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at&para;<br>511 (“unrefined” uses of the word “jurisdiction” are enti­&para;<br>tled to “no precedential effect” (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted)). And in NRAB First Div. Award No. 23867, p. 5&para;<br>(Apr. 7, 1988), the panel observed that the ordinary rem­&para;<br>edy for lack of conferencing is to “dismiss th[e] claim with­&para;<br>out prejudice to allow Claimant to cure the jurisdictional&para;<br>defect.” That panel reached the merits nevertheless. Ibid.&para;<br>Cf. Steel Co., 523 U. S., at 94 (“Jurisdiction is power to&para;<br>declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only&para;<br>function remaining to the [tribunal] is that of announcing&para;<br>the fact and dismissing the cause” (quoting Ex parte&para;<br>McCardle, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869)).). We note, in addition,&para;<br>the acknowledgment of the Carrier’s counsel that, if con­&para;<br>ferencing has not occurred, NRAB panels have stayed&para;<br>arbitration to allow the parties to confer.
