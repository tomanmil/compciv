Argued February 28, 2012—Decided April 18, 2012&para;<br>While visiting the West Bank, Azzam Rahim, a naturalized United&para;<br>States citizen, allegedly was arrested by Palestinian Authority intelligence officers, imprisoned, tortured, and ultimately killed. Rahim’s&para;<br>relatives, petitioners here, sued the Palestinian Authority and the&para;<br>Palestine Liberation Organization under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 (TVPA), which authorizes a cause of action&para;<br>against “[a]n individual” for acts of torture and extrajudicial killing&para;<br>committed under authority or color of law of any foreign nation. 106&para;<br>Stat. 73, note following 28 U. S. C. §1350. The District Court dismissed the suit, concluding, as relevant here, that the TVPA’s authorization of suit against “[a]n individual” extended liability only to&para;<br>natural persons. The United States Court of Appeals for the District&para;<br>of Columbia Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: As used in the TVPA, the term “individual” encompasses only&para;<br>natural persons. Consequently, the Act does not impose liability&para;<br>against organizations. Pp. 2–11.&para;<br>(a) The ordinary, everyday meaning of “individual” refers to a human being, not an organization, and Congress in the normal course&para;<br>does not employ the word any differently. The Dictionary Act defines&para;<br>“person” to include certain artificial entities “as well as individuals,”&para;<br>1 U. S. C. §1, thereby marking “individual” as distinct from artificial&para;<br>entities. Federal statutes routinely distinguish between an “individual” and an organizational entity. See, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §§92(k), 511.&para;<br>And the very Congress that passed the TVPA defined “person” in a&para;<br>separate Act to include “any individual or entity.” 18 U. S.

Pp. 2–5.&para;<br>(b) Before a word will be assumed to have a meaning broader than&para;<br>or different from its ordinary meaning, Congress must give some indication that it intended such a result. There are no such indications&para;<br>in the TVPA. To the contrary, the statutory context confirms that&para;<br>Congress in the Act created a cause of action against natural persons&para;<br>alone. The Act’s liability provision uses the word “individual” five&para;<br>times in the same sentence: once to refer to the perpetrator and four&para;<br>times to refer to the victim. See TVPA §2(a). Since only a natural&para;<br>person can be a victim of torture or extrajudicial killing, it is difficult&para;<br>to conclude that Congress used “individual” four times in the same&para;<br>sentence to refer to a natural person and once to refer to a natural&para;<br>person and any nonsovereign organization. In addition, the TVPA&para;<br>holds perpetrators liable for extrajudicial killing to “any person who&para;<br>may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.” See TVPA&para;<br>§2(a)(2). “Persons” often has a broader meaning in the law than “individual,” and frequently includes non-natural persons. Construing&para;<br>“individual” in the Act to encompass solely natural persons credits&para;<br>Congress’ use of disparate terms. Pp. 5–6.&para;<br>(c) Petitioners’ counterarguments are unpersuasive. Pp. 6–11.&para;<br>(1) Petitioners dispute that the plain text of the TVPA requires&para;<br>this Court’s result. First, they rely on definitions that frame “individual” in nonhuman terms, emphasizing the idea of “oneness,” but&para;<br>these definitions make for an awkward fit in the context of the TVPA.&para;<br>Next they claim that federal tort statutes uniformly provide for liability against organizations, a convention they maintain is common to&para;<br>the legal systems of other nations. But while “Congress is understood to legislate against a background of common-law adjudicatory&para;<br>principles,” Astoria Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S.&para;<br>104, 108, Congress plainly evinced its intent in the TVPA not to subject organizations to liability. Petitioners next argue that the TVPA’s&para;<br>scope of liability should be construed to conform with other federal&para;<br>statutes they claim provide civil remedies to victims of torture or extrajudicial killing. But none of the statutes petitioners cite employs&para;<br>the term “individual,” as the TVPA, to describe the covered defendant. Finally, although petitioners rightly note that the TVPA contemplates liability against officers who do not personally execute the&para;<br>torture or extrajudicial killing, it does not follow that the Act embraces liability against nonsovereign organizations. Pp. 6–8.&para;<br>(2) Petitioners also contend that legislative history supports their&para;<br>broad reading of “individual,” but “reliance on legislative history is&para;<br>unnecessary in light of the statute’s unambiguous language.” Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milavetz, P.

It does not define “individual.”&para;<br>Petitioners concede that foreign states may not be sued&para;<br>under the Act—namely, that the Act does not create an&para;<br>exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of&para;<br>1976, 28 U. S. C. §1602 et seq., which renders foreign&para;<br>sovereigns largely immune from suits in U. S. courts.&para;<br>They argue, however, that the TVPA does not similarly&para;<br>restrict liability against other juridical entities. In petitioners’ view, by permitting suit against “[a]n individual,”&para;<br>the TVPA contemplates liability against natural persons&para;<br>and nonsovereign organizations (a category that, petitioners assert, includes respondents). We decline to read&para;<br>“individual” so unnaturally. The ordinary meaning of the&para;<br>word, fortified by its statutory context, persuades us that&para;<br>the Act authorizes suit against natural persons alone.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Because the TVPA does not define the term “individual,”&para;<br>we look first to the word’s ordinary meaning. See FCC v.&para;<br>AT&amp;T Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5) (“When&para;<br>a statute does not define a term, we typically give the&para;<br>phrase its ordinary meaning” (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted)). As a noun, “individual” ordinarily means “[a]&para;<br>human being, a person.” 7 Oxford English Dictionary 880&para;<br>(2d ed. 1989); see also, e.g., Random House Dictionary&para;<br>of the English Language 974 (2d ed. 1987) (“a person”);&para;<br>Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1152 (1986)&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(“a particular person”) (hereinafter Webster’s). After all,&para;<br>that is how we use the word in everyday parlance. We say&para;<br>“the individual went to the store,” “the individual left&para;<br>the room,” and “the individual took the car,” each time referring unmistakably to a natural person. And no one, we&para;<br>hazard to guess, refers in normal parlance to an organization as an “individual.” Evidencing that common usage,&para;<br>this Court routinely uses “individual” to denote a natural&para;<br>person, and in particular to distinguish between a natural&para;<br>person and a corporation. See, e.g., Goodyear Dunlop&para;<br>Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S. __, __ (2011)&para;<br>(slip op., at 7) (“For an individual, the paradigm forum&para;<br>for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual’s&para;<br>domicile; for a corporation, it is an equivalent place, one in&para;<br>which the corporation is fairly regarded as at home”).&para;<br>Congress does not, in the ordinary course, employ the&para;<br>word any differently. The Dictionary Act instructs that&para;<br>“[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress,&para;<br>unless the context indicates otherwise . . . the wor[d]&para;<br>‘person’ . . . include[s] corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals.” 1 U. S. C. §1 (emphasis&para;<br>added). With the phrase “as well as,” the definition marks&para;<br>“individual” as distinct from the list of artificial entities&para;<br>that precedes it.&para;<br>In a like manner, federal statutes routinely distinguish&para;<br>between an “individual” and an organizational entity of&para;<br>some kind. See, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §92(k) (“ ‘Person’ includes&para;<br>partnerships, associations, and corporations, as well as&para;<br>individuals”); §511 (same); 15 U. S. C. §717a (“ ‘Person’&para;<br>includes an individual or a corporation”); 16 U. S. C. §796&para;<br>(“ ‘[P]erson’ means an individual or a corporation”); 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §1101(b)(3) (“ ‘[P]erson’ means an individual or an&para;<br>organization”). Indeed, the very same Congress that&para;<br>enacted the TVPA also established a cause of action for&para;<br>U. S. nationals injured “by reason of an act of interna-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tional terrorism” and defined “person” as it appears in&para;<br>the statute to include “any individual or entity capable of&para;<br>holding a legal or beneficial interest in property.” Federal&para;<br>Courts Administration Act of 1992, 18 U. S. C. §§2333(a),&para;<br>2331(3) (emphasis added)).&para;<br>B&para;<br>This is not to say that the word “individual” invariably&para;<br>means “natural person” when used in a statute. Congress&para;<br>remains free, as always, to give the word a broader or&para;<br>different meaning. But before we will assume it has done&para;<br>so, there must be some indication Congress intended such&para;<br>a result. Perhaps it is the rare statute (petitioners point&para;<br>to only one such example, located in the Internal Revenue&para;<br>Code) in which Congress expressly defines “individual” to&para;<br>include corporate entities. See 26 U. S. C. §542(a)(2). Or&para;<br>perhaps, as was the case in Clinton v. City of New York,&para;<br>524 U. S. 417, 429 (1998), the statutory context makes&para;<br>that intention clear, because any other reading of “individual” would lead to an “ ‘absurd’ ” result Congress could&para;<br>not plausibly have intended.&para;<br>There are no such indications in the TVPA. As noted,&para;<br>the Act does not define “individual,” much less do so in a&para;<br>manner that extends the term beyond its ordinary usage.&para;<br>And the statutory context strengthens—not undermines—&para;<br>the conclusion that Congress intended to create a cause of&para;<br>action against natural persons alone. The Act’s liability&para;<br>provision uses the word “individual” five times in the same&para;<br>sentence: once to refer to the perpetrator (i.e., the defendant) and four times to refer to the victim. See §2(a). Only&para;<br>a natural person can be a victim of torture or extrajudicial&para;<br>killing. “Since there is a presumption that a given term&para;<br>is used to mean the same thing throughout a statute, a&para;<br>presumption surely at its most vigorous when a term is&para;<br>repeated within a given sentence,” Brown v. Gardner, 513&para;<br>U. S. 115, 118 (1994) (citation omitted), it is difficult in-&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>deed to conclude that Congress employed the term “individual” four times in one sentence to refer to a natural&para;<br>person and once to refer to a natural person and any&para;<br>nonsovereign organization. See also §3(b)(1) (using term&para;<br>“individual” six times in referring to victims of torture).&para;<br>It is also revealing that the Act holds perpetrators liable for extrajudicial killing to “any person who may be a&para;<br>claimant in an action for wrongful death.” §2(a)(2) (emphasis added). “Person,” we have recognized, often has a&para;<br>broader meaning in the law than “individual,” see Clinton,&para;<br>524 U. S., at 428, n. 13, and frequently includes nonnatural persons, see, e.g., 1 U. S. C. §1. We generally seek&para;<br>to respect Congress’ decision to use different terms to describe different categories of people or things. See Sosa v.&para;<br>Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 711, n. 9 (2004). Our&para;<br>construction of “individual” to encompass solely natural&para;<br>persons credits Congress’ use of the disparate terms;&para;<br>petitioners’ construction does not.3&para;<br>In sum, the text of the statute persuades us that the Act&para;<br>authorizes liability solely against natural persons.&para;<br>III&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioners’ counterarguments are unpersuasive. &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>Petitioners first dispute that the plain text of the TVPA&para;<br>requires today’s result. Although they concede that an&para;<br>ordinary meaning of “individual” is “human being,” petitioners point to definitions of “individual” that “frame the&para;<br>term . . . in distinctly non-human terms, instead placing&para;<br>their emphases on the oneness of something.” Brief for&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The parties debate whether estates, or other nonnatural persons, in&para;<br>fact may be claimants in a wrongful-death action. We think the debate&para;<br>largely immaterial. Regardless of whether jurisdictions today allow for&para;<br>such actions, Congress’ use of the broader term evidences an intent to&para;<br>accommodate that possibility.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

Those definitions, however, do not&para;<br>account even for petitioners’ preferred interpretation of “individual” in the Act, for foreign states—which petitioners concede are not liable under the Act—do not differ&para;<br>from nonsovereign organizations in their degree of “oneness.” Moreover, “[w]ords that can have more than one&para;<br>meaning are given content . . . by their surroundings,”&para;<br>Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457,&para;<br>466 (2001), and for the reasons explained supra, petitioners’ definition makes for an awkward fit in the context of&para;<br>the TVPA.&para;<br>Petitioners next claim that federal tort statutes uniformly provide for liability against organizations, a convention they maintain is common to the legal systems of&para;<br>other nations. We are not convinced, however, that any&para;<br>such “domestic and international presumption of organizational liability” in tort actions overcomes the ordinary meaning of “individual.” Brief for Petitioners 16. It&para;<br>is true that “Congress is understood to legislate against&para;<br>a background of common-law adjudicatory principles.”&para;<br>Astoria Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S. 104,&para;<br>108 (1991). But Congress plainly can override those principles, see, e.g., id., at 108–109, and, as explained supra,&para;<br>the TVPA’s text evinces a clear intent not to subject nonsovereign organizations to liability.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Petitioners’ separate contention that the TVPA must be construed&para;<br>in light of international agreements prohibiting torture and extrajudicial killing fails for similar reasons. Whatever the scope of those agreements, the TVPA does not define “individual” by reference to them,&para;<br>and principles they elucidate cannot overcome the statute’s text. The&para;<br>same is true of petitioners’ suggestion that Congress in the TVPA&para;<br>imported a “specialized usage” of the word “individual” in international&para;<br>law. Brief for Petitioners 6. There is no indication in the text of the&para;<br>statute or legislative history that Congress knew of any such specialized usage of the term, much less intended to import it into the Act.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MOHAMAD v.

None of the&para;<br>three statutes petitioners identify employs the term “individual” to describe the covered defendant, and so none&para;<br>assists in the interpretive task we face today. See 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §1983; 28 U. S. C. §§1603(a), 1605A(c) (2006 ed.,&para;<br>Supp. IV); 18 U. S. C. §§2333, 2334(a)–(b), 2337. The&para;<br>same is true of the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U. S. C. §1350, so&para;<br>it offers no comparative value here regardless of whether&para;<br>corporate entities can be held liable in a federal commonlaw action brought under that statute.

Finally, although petitioners rightly note that the TVPA contemplates liability against officers who do not personally&para;<br>execute the torture or extrajudicial killing, see, e.g.,&para;<br>Chavez v. Carranza, 559 F. 3d 486 (CA6 2009), it does not&para;<br>follow (as petitioners argue) that the Act embraces liability against nonsovereign organizations.

Yet that&para;<br>statement, while clarifying that the Act does not encompass liability against foreign states, says nothing about&para;<br>liability against nonsovereign organizations. The other&para;<br>excerpts petitioners cite likewise are not probative of the&para;<br>meaning of “individual,” for they signal only that the Act&para;<br>does not impose liability on perpetrators who act without&para;<br>authority or color of law of a foreign state.

The amendment was unanimously&para;<br>adopted, and the version of the bill reported out of Committee reflected the change. Id., at 88; H. R. Rep. No. 693,&para;<br>pt. 1, p. 1 (1988). A materially identical version of the bill&para;<br>was enacted as the TVPA by the 102d Congress. Although&para;<br>we are cognizant of the limitations of this drafting history,&para;<br>cf. Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545&para;<br>U. S. 546, 568 (2005), we nevertheless find it telling that&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MOHAMAD v. PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the sole explanation for substituting “individual” for “person” confirms what we have concluded from the text alone.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Petitioners’ final argument is that the Act would be&para;<br>rendered toothless by a construction of “individual” that&para;<br>limits liability to natural persons. They contend that precluding organizational liability may foreclose effective&para;<br>remedies for victims and their relatives for any number of&para;<br>reasons. Victims may be unable to identify the men and&para;<br>women who subjected them to torture, all the while knowing the organization for whom they work. Personal jurisdiction may be more easily established over corporate than&para;<br>human beings. And natural persons may be more likely&para;<br>than organizations to be judgment proof. Indeed, we are&para;<br>told that only two TVPA plaintiffs have been able to recover successfully against a natural person—one only after&para;<br>the defendant won the state lottery. See Jean v. Dorelien,&para;<br>431 F. 3d 776, 778 (CA11 2005).&para;<br>We acknowledge petitioners’ concerns about the limitations on recovery. But they are ones that Congress imposed and that we must respect. “[N]o legislation pursues&para;<br>its purposes at all costs,” Rodriguez v. United States, 480&para;<br>U. S. 522, 525–526 (1987) (per curiam), and petitioners’&para;<br>purposive argument simply cannot overcome the force of&para;<br>the plain text. We add only that Congress appeared well&para;<br>aware of the limited nature of the cause of action it established in the Act. See, e.g., 138 Cong. Rec. 4177 (1992)&para;<br>(remarks of Sen. Simpson) (noting that “as a practical&para;<br>matter, this legislation will result in a very small number&para;<br>of cases”); 137 Cong. Rec. 2671 (1991) (remarks of Sen.&para;<br>Specter) (“Let me emphasize that the bill is a limited&para;<br>measure. It is estimated that only a few of these lawsuits&para;<br>will ever be brought”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The text of the TVPA convinces us that Congress did not&para;<br>extend liability to organizations, sovereign or not. There&para;<br>are no doubt valid arguments for such an extension. But&para;<br>Congress has seen fit to proceed in more modest steps in&para;<br>the Act, and it is not the province of this Branch to do&para;<br>otherwise.

The&para;<br>word “individual” is open to multiple interpretations,&para;<br>permitting it, linguistically speaking, to include natural&para;<br>persons, corporations, and other entities. Thus, I do not&para;<br>believe that word alone is sufficient to decide this case.&para;<br>The legislative history of the statute, however, makes&para;<br>up for whatever interpretive inadequacies remain after considering language alone. See, e.g., ante, at 9 (describing markup session in which one of the bill’s sponsors&para;<br>proposed an amendment containing the word “individual”&para;<br>to “make it clear” that the statute applied to “individuals&para;<br>and not to corporations”); Hearing on S. 1629 et al. before the Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs&para;<br>of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 101st Cong.,&para;<br>2d Sess., 65 (1990) (witness explaining to committee that&para;<br>there would be a “problem” with suing an “independent entity or a series of entities that are not governments,” such&para;<br>as the Palestine Liberation Organization); id., at 75&para;<br>(allaying concerns that there will be a flood of lawsuits&para;<br>“because of the requirement [in the statute] that an individual has to identify his or her precise torture[r] and they&para;<br>have to be both in the United States”); see also ante, at 8–&para;<br>9 (making clear that petitioners’ citations to the legislative&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MOHAMAD v.
