FLOR-&para;<br>&para;<br>IDA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTEC-&para;<br>&para;<br>TION ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA&para;<br>No. 08–1151. Argued December 2, 2009—Decided June 17, 2010&para;<br>Florida owns in trust for the public the land permanently submerged&para;<br>beneath navigable waters and the foreshore. The mean high-water&para;<br>line is the ordinary boundary between private beachfront, or littoral&para;<br>property, and state-owned land. Littoral owners have, inter alia,&para;<br>rights to have access to the water, to use the water for certain pur&para;<br>poses, to have an unobstructed view of the water, and to receive ac&para;<br>cretions and relictions (collectively, accretions) to the littoral prop&para;<br>erty. An accretion occurs gradually and imperceptibly, while a&para;<br>sudden change is an avulsion. The littoral owner automatically takes&para;<br>title to dry land added to his property by accretion. With avulsion,&para;<br>however, the seaward boundary of littoral property remains what it&para;<br>was: the mean high-water line before the event. Thus, when an avul&para;<br>sion has added new land, the littoral owner has no right to subse&para;<br>quent accretions, because the property abutting the water belongs to&para;<br>the owner of the seabed (ordinarily the State).&para;<br>Florida’s Beach and Shore Preservation Act establishes procedures&para;<br>for depositing sand on eroded beaches (restoration) and maintaining&para;<br>the deposited sand (nourishment). When such a project is under&para;<br>taken, the State entity that holds title to the seabed sets a fixed “ero&para;<br>sion control line” to replace the fluctuating mean high-water line as&para;<br>the boundary between littoral and state property. Once the new line&para;<br>is recorded, the common law ceases to apply. Thereafter, when accre&para;<br>tion moves the mean high-water line seaward, the littoral property&para;<br>remains bounded by the permanent erosion-control line.&para;<br>Respondents the city of Destin and Walton County sought permits&para;<br>to restore 6.9 miles of beach eroded by several hurricanes, adding&para;<br>about 75 feet of dry sand seaward of the mean high-water line (to be&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- &para;<br>&para;<br>IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>denominated the erosion-control line). Petitioner, a nonprofit corpo&para;<br>ration formed by owners of beachfront property bordering the project&para;<br>(hereinafter Members) brought an unsuccessful administrative chal&para;<br>lenge. Respondent the Florida Department of Environmental Protec&para;<br>tion approved the permits, and this suit followed. The State Court of&para;<br>Appeal concluded that the Department’s order had eliminated the&para;<br>Members’ littoral rights (1) to receive accretions to their property and&para;<br>(2) to have their property’s contact with the water remain intact.&para;<br>Concluding that this would be an unconstitutional taking and would&para;<br>require an additional administrative requirement to be met, it set&para;<br>aside the order, remanded the proceeding, and certified to the Florida&para;<br>Supreme Court the question whether the Act unconstitutionally de&para;<br>prived the Members of littoral rights without just compensation. The&para;<br>State Supreme Court answered “no” and quashed the remand, con&para;<br>cluding that the Members did not own the property supposedly&para;<br>taken. Petitioner sought rehearing on the ground that the Florida&para;<br>Supreme Court’s decision effected a taking of the Members’ littoral&para;<br>rights contrary to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments; rehearing&para;<br>was denied.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The judgment is affirmed.&para;<br>998 So. 2d 1102, affirmed.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to&para;<br>Parts I, IV, and V, concluding that the Florida Supreme Court did not&para;<br>take property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendments. Pp. 24–29.&para;<br>(a) Respondents’ arguments that petitioner does not own the prop&para;<br>erty and that the case is not ripe were not raised in the briefs in op&para;<br>position and thus are deemed waived. Pp. 24–25.&para;<br>(b) There can be no taking unless petitioner can show that, before&para;<br>the Florida Supreme Court’s decision, littoral property owners had&para;<br>rights to future accretions and to contact with the water superior to&para;<br>the State’s right to fill in its submerged land. That showing cannot&para;<br>be made. Two core Florida property-law principles intersect here.&para;<br>First, the State as owner of the submerged land adjacent to littoral&para;<br>property has the right to fill that land, so long as it does not interfere&para;<br>with the rights of the public and of littoral landowners. Second, if an&para;<br>avulsion exposes land seaward of littoral property that had previ&para;<br>ously been submerged, that land belongs to the State even if it inter&para;<br>rupts the littoral owner’s contact with the water. Prior Florida law&para;<br>suggests that there is no exception to this rule when the State causes&para;<br>the avulsion. Thus, Florida law as it stood before the decision below&para;<br>allowed the State to fill in its own seabed, and the resulting sudden&para;<br>exposure of previously submerged land was treated like an avulsion&para;<br>for ownership purposes. The right to accretions was therefore subor&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>dinate to the State’s right to fill. Pp. 25–27.&para;<br>(c) The decision below is consistent with these principles. Cf. Lucas&para;<br>v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1028–1029. It did&para;<br>not abolish the Members’ right to future accretions, but merely held&para;<br>that the right was not implicated by the beach-restoration project be&para;<br>cause of the doctrine of avulsion. Relying on dicta in the Florida Su&para;<br>preme Court’s Sand Key decision, petitioner contends that the State&para;<br>took the Members’ littoral right to have the boundary always be the&para;<br>mean high-water line. But petitioner’s interpretation of that dictum&para;<br>contradicts the clear law governing avulsion. One cannot say the&para;<br>Florida Supreme Court contravened established property law by re&para;<br>jecting it. Pp. 27–29.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE THOMAS, and&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO, concluded in Parts II and III that if a court declares&para;<br>that what was once an established right of private property no longer&para;<br>exists, it has taken that property in violation of the Takings Clause.&para;<br>Pp. 7–24.&para;<br>(a) Though the classic taking is a transfer of property by eminent&para;<br>domain, the Clause applies to other state actions that achieve the&para;<br>same thing, including those that recharacterize as public property&para;<br>what was previously private property, see Webb’s Fabulous Pharma&para;<br>cies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155, 163–165. The Clause is not ad&para;<br>dressed to the action of a specific branch or branches. It is concerned&para;<br>simply with the act, not with the governmental actor. This Court’s&para;<br>precedents provide no support for the proposition that takings ef&para;<br>fected by the judicial branch are entitled to special treatment, and in&para;<br>fact suggest the contrary. See PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins,&para;<br>447 U. S. 74, Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, supra. Pp. 7–20.&para;<br>(b) For a judicial taking, respondents would add to the normal tak&para;<br>ings inquiry the requirement that the court’s decision have no “fair&para;<br>and substantial basis.” This test is not obviously appropriate, but it&para;<br>is no different in this context from the requirement that the property&para;<br>owner prove an established property right. Respondents’ additional&para;<br>arguments—that federal courts lack the knowledge of state law re&para;<br>quired to decide whether a state judicial decision purporting to clarify&para;<br>property rights has instead taken them; that common-law judging&para;<br>should not be deprived of needed flexibility; and that applying the&para;<br>Takings Clause to judicial decisions would force lower federal courts&para;<br>to review final state-court judgments, in violation of the RookerFeldman doctrine, see Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413,&para;<br>415–416, District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S.&para;<br>462, 476—are unpersuasive. And petitioner’s proposed “unpredict&para;<br>ability test”—that a judicial taking consists of a decision that “consti&para;<br>tutes a sudden change in state law, unpredictable in terms of rele&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- &para;<br>&para;<br>IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>vant precedents,” Hughes v. Washington, 389 U. S. 290, 296 (Stewart,&para;<br>J., concurring)—is misdirected. What counts is not whether there is&para;<br>precedent for the allegedly confiscatory decision, but whether the&para;<br>property right allegedly taken was well established. Pp. 20–24.&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, agreed that the&para;<br>Florida Supreme Court did not take property without just compensa&para;<br>tion, but concluded that this case does not require the Court to de&para;<br>termine whether, or when, a judicial decision determining property&para;<br>owners’ rights can violate the Takings Clause. If and when future&para;<br>cases show that the usual principles, including constitutional ones&para;<br>that constrain the judiciary like due process, are inadequate to pro&para;<br>tect property owners, then the question whether a judicial decision&para;<br>can effect a taking would be properly presented. Pp. 1–10.&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG, agreed that no un&para;<br>constitutional taking occurred here, but concluded that it is unneces&para;<br>sary to decide more than that to resolve this case. Difficult questions&para;<br>of constitutional law—e.g., whether federal courts may review a state&para;<br>court’s decision to determine if it unconstitutionally takes private&para;<br>property without compensation, and what the proper test is for evalu&para;<br>ating whether a state-court property decision enacts an unconstitu&para;<br>tional taking—need not be addressed in order to dispose “of the im&para;<br>mediate case.” Whitehouse v. Illinois Central R. Co., 349 U. S. 366,&para;<br>373. Such questions are better left for another day.

Thus, the mean high-water line&para;<br>(the average reach of high tide over the preceding 19&para;<br>years) is the ordinary boundary between private beach&para;<br>front, or littoral1 property, and state-owned land.

This is generally in&para;<br>accord with well-established common law, although the&para;<br>precise property rights vary among jurisdictions. Com&para;<br>pare Broward, supra, at 409–410, 50 So., at 830, with 1 J.&para;<br>Lewis, Law of Eminent Domain §100 (3d ed. 1909); 1 H.&para;<br>Farnham, Law of Waters and Water Rights §62, pp. 278–&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Many cases and statutes use “riparian” to mean abutting any body&para;<br>of water. The Florida Supreme Court, however, has adopted a more&para;<br>precise usage whereby “riparian” means abutting a river or stream and&para;<br>“littoral” means abutting an ocean, sea, or lake. Walton Cty. v. Stop the&para;<br>Beach Renourishment, Inc., 998 So. 2d 1102, 1105, n. 3 (2008). When&para;<br>speaking of the Florida law applicable to this case, we follow the&para;<br>Florida Supreme Court’s terminology.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>280 (1904) (hereinafter Farnham).&para;<br>At the center of this case is the right to accretions and&para;<br>relictions. Accretions are additions of alluvion (sand,&para;<br>sediment, or other deposits) to waterfront land; relictions&para;<br>are lands once covered by water that become dry when the&para;<br>water recedes. F. Maloney, S. Plager, &amp; F. Baldwin, Wa&para;<br>ter Law and Administration: The Florida Experience §126,&para;<br>pp. 385–386 (1968) (hereinafter Maloney); 1 Farnham §69,&para;<br>at 320. (For simplicity’s sake, we shall refer to accretions&para;<br>and relictions collectively as accretions, and the process&para;<br>whereby they occur as accretion.) In order for an addition&para;<br>to dry land to qualify as an accretion, it must have oc&para;<br>curred gradually and imperceptibly—that is, so slowly&para;<br>that one could not see the change occurring, though over&para;<br>time the difference became apparent. Sand Key, supra, at&para;<br>936; County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46, 66–67&para;<br>(1874). When, on the other hand, there is a “sudden or&para;<br>perceptible loss of or addition to land by the action of the&para;<br>water or a sudden change in the bed of a lake or the course&para;<br>of a stream,” the change is called an avulsion. Sand Key,&para;<br>supra, at 936; see also 1 Farnham §69, at 320.&para;<br>In Florida, as at common law, the littoral owner auto&para;<br>matically takes title to dry land added to his property by&para;<br>accretion; but formerly submerged land that has become&para;<br>dry land by avulsion continues to belong to the owner of&para;<br>the seabed (usually the State). See, e.g., Sand Key, supra,&para;<br>at 937; Maloney §126.6, at 392; 2 W. Blackstone, Commen&para;<br>taries on the Laws of England 261–262 (1766) (hereinafter&para;<br>Blackstone). Thus, regardless of whether an avulsive&para;<br>event exposes land previously submerged or submerges&para;<br>land previously exposed, the boundary between littoral&para;<br>property and sovereign land does not change; it remains&para;<br>(ordinarily) what was the mean high-water line before the&para;<br>event. See Bryant v. Peppe, 238 So. 2d 836, 838–839 (Fla.&para;<br>1970); J. Gould, Law of Waters §158, p. 290 (1883). It&para;<br>follows from this that, when a new strip of land has been&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- &para;<br>&para;<br>IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>added to the shore by avulsion, the littoral owner has no&para;<br>right to subsequent accretions. Those accretions no longer&para;<br>add to his property, since the property abutting the water&para;<br>belongs not to him but to the State. See Maloney §126.6,&para;<br>at 393; 1 Farnham §71a, at 328.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In 1961, Florida’s Legislature passed the Beach and&para;<br>Shore Preservation Act, 1961 Fla. Laws ch. 61–246, as&para;<br>amended, Fla. Stat. §§161.011–161.45 (2007). The Act&para;<br>establishes procedures for “beach restoration and nour&para;<br>ishment projects,” §161.088, designed to deposit sand on&para;<br>eroded beaches (restoration) and to maintain the deposited&para;<br>sand (nourishment). §§161.021(3), (4). A local govern&para;<br>ment may apply to the Department of Environmental&para;<br>Protection for the funds and the necessary permits to&para;<br>restore a beach, see §§161.101(1), 161.041(1). When the&para;<br>project involves placing fill on the State’s submerged&para;<br>lands, authorization is required from the Board of Trus&para;<br>tees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, see&para;<br>§253.77(1), which holds title to those lands, §253.12(1).&para;<br>Once a beach restoration “is determined to be under&para;<br>taken,” the Board sets what is called “an erosion control&para;<br>line.” §§161.161(3)–(5). It must be set by reference to the&para;<br>existing mean high-water line, though in theory it can be&para;<br>located seaward or landward of that.2 See §161.161(5).&para;<br>Much of the project work occurs seaward of the erosion&para;<br>control line, as sand is dumped on what was once sub&para;<br>merged land. See App. 87–88.

Once the erosion-control line&para;<br>is recorded, the common law ceases to increase upland&para;<br>property by accretion (or decrease it by erosion).&para;<br>§161.191(2). Thus, when accretion to the shore moves the&para;<br>mean high-water line seaward, the property of beachfront&para;<br>landowners is not extended to that line (as the prior law&para;<br>provided), but remains bounded by the permanent erosion&para;<br>control line. Those landowners “continue to be entitled,”&para;<br>however, “to all common-law riparian rights” other than&para;<br>the right to accretions. §161.201. If the beach erodes back&para;<br>landward of the erosion-control line over a substantial&para;<br>portion of the shoreline covered by the project, the Board&para;<br>may, on its own initiative, or must, if asked by the owners&para;<br>or lessees of a majority of the property affected, direct the&para;<br>agency responsible for maintaining the beach to return the&para;<br>beach to the condition contemplated by the project. If that&para;<br>is not done within a year, the project is canceled and the&para;<br>erosion-control line is null and void. §161.211(2), (3).&para;<br>Finally, by regulation, if the use of submerged land would&para;<br>“unreasonably infringe on riparian rights,” the project&para;<br>cannot proceed unless the local governments show that&para;<br>they own or have a property interest in the upland prop&para;<br>erty adjacent to the project site.

The District Court of Appeal for&para;<br>the First District concluded that, contrary to the Act’s&para;<br>preservation of “all common-law riparian rights,” the order&para;<br>had eliminated two of the Members’ littoral rights: (1) the&para;<br>right to receive accretions to their property; and (2) the&para;<br>right to have the contact of their property with the water&para;<br>remain intact. Save Our Beaches, Inc. v. Florida Dept. of&para;<br>Environmental Protection, 27 So. 3d 48, 57 (2006). This, it&para;<br>believed, would be an unconstitutional taking, which&para;<br>would “unreasonably infringe on riparian rights,” and&para;<br>therefore require the showing under Fla. Admin. Code&para;<br>Rule 18–21.004(3)(b) that the local governments owned or&para;<br>had a property interest in the upland property.

The Takings Clause—“nor shall private&para;<br>property be taken for public use, without just compensa&para;<br>tion,” U. S. Const., Amdt. 5—applies as fully to the taking&para;<br>of a landowner’s riparian rights as it does to the taking of&para;<br>an estate in land.5 See Yates v. Milwaukee, 10 Wall. 497,&para;<br>504 (1871). Moreover, though the classic taking is a trans&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 We ordinarily do not consider an issue first presented to a state&para;<br>court in a petition for rehearing if the state court did not address it.&para;<br>See Adams v. Robertson, 520 U. S. 83, 89, n. 3 (1997) (per curiam). But&para;<br>where the state-court decision itself is claimed to constitute a violation&para;<br>of federal law, the state court’s refusal to address that claim put for&para;<br>ward in a petition for rehearing will not bar our review. See Brinker&para;<br>hoff-Faris Trust &amp; Sav. Co. v. Hill, 281 U. S. 673, 677–678 (1930).&para;<br>5 We thus need not resolve whether the right of accretion is an ease&para;<br>ment, as petitioner claims, or, as Florida claims, a contingent future&para;<br>interest.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v.

Thus, when the&para;<br>government uses its own property in such a way that it&para;<br>destroys private property, it has taken that property. See&para;<br>United States v. Causby, 328 U. S. 256, 261–262 (1946);&para;<br>Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166, 177–178 (1872).&para;<br>Similarly, our doctrine of regulatory takings “aims to&para;<br>identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent&para;<br>to the classic taking.” Lingle v. Chevron U. S. A. Inc., 544&para;<br>U. S. 528, 539 (2005). Thus, it is a taking when a state&para;<br>regulation forces a property owner to submit to a perma&para;<br>nent physical occupation, Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhat&para;<br>tan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 425–426 (1982), or de&para;<br>prives him of all economically beneficial use of his&para;<br>property, Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505&para;<br>U. S. 1003, 1019 (1992). Finally (and here we approach&para;<br>the situation before us), States effect a taking if they&para;<br>recharacterize as public property what was previously&para;<br>private property. See Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v.&para;<br>Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155, 163–165 (1980).&para;<br>The Takings Clause (unlike, for instance, the Ex Post&para;<br>Facto Clauses, see Art. I, §9, cl. 3; §10, cl. 1) is not ad&para;<br>dressed to the action of a specific branch or branches. It is&para;<br>concerned simply with the act, and not with the govern&para;<br>mental actor (“nor shall private property be taken” (em&para;<br>phasis added)). There is no textual justification for saying&para;<br>that the existence or the scope of a State’s power to expro&para;<br>priate private property without just compensation varies&para;<br>according to the branch of government effecting the expro&para;<br>priation. Nor does common sense recommend such a&para;<br>principle. It would be absurd to allow a State to do by&para;<br>judicial decree what the Takings Clause forbids it to do by&para;<br>legislative fiat. See Stevens v. Cannon Beach, 510 U. S.&para;<br>1207, 1211–1212 (1994) (SCALIA, J., dissenting from denial&para;<br>of certiorari).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Robins, 447 U. S. 74&para;<br>(1980), involved a decision of the California Supreme&para;<br>Court overruling one of its prior decisions which had held&para;<br>that the California Constitution’s guarantees of freedom of&para;<br>speech and of the press, and of the right to petition the&para;<br>government, did not require the owner of private property&para;<br>to accord those rights on his premises. The appellants,&para;<br>owners of a shopping center, contended that their private&para;<br>property rights could not “be denied by invocation of a&para;<br>state constitutional provision or by judicial reconstruction&para;<br>of a State’s laws of private property,” id., at 79 (emphasis&para;<br>added). We held that there had been no taking, citing&para;<br>cases involving legislative and executive takings, and&para;<br>applying standard Takings Clause analysis. See id., at&para;<br>82–84. We treated the California Supreme Court’s appli&para;<br>cation of the constitutional provisions as a regulation of&para;<br>the use of private property, and evaluated whether that&para;<br>regulation violated the property owners’ “right to exclude&para;<br>others,” id., at 80 (internal quotation marks omitted). Our&para;<br>opinion addressed only the claimed taking by the constitu&para;<br>tional provision. Its failure to speak separately to the&para;<br>claimed taking by “judicial reconstruction of a State’s laws&para;<br>of private property” certainly does not suggest that a&para;<br>taking by judicial action cannot occur, and arguably sug&para;<br>gests that the same analysis applicable to taking by con&para;<br>stitutional provision would apply.&para;<br>Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, supra, is even closer in&para;<br>point. There the purchaser of an insolvent corporation&para;<br>had interpleaded the corporation’s creditors, placing the&para;<br>purchase price in an interest-bearing account in the regis&para;<br>try of the Circuit Court of Seminole County, to be distrib&para;<br>uted in satisfaction of claims approved by a receiver. The&para;<br>Florida Supreme Court construed an applicable statute to&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- &para;<br>&para;<br>IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION &para;<br>&para;<br>the&para;<br>Court&para;<br>Opinion of S&para;<br>CALIA&para;<br>, J. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>mean that the interest on the account belonged to the&para;<br>county, because the account was “considered ‘public&para;<br>money,’ ” Beckwith v. Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, 374&para;<br>So. 2d 951, 952–953 (1979) (per curiam). We held this to&para;<br>be a taking. We noted that “[t]he usual and general rule is&para;<br>that any interest on an interpleaded and deposited fund&para;<br>follows the principal and is to be allocated to those who&para;<br>are ultimately to be the owners of that principal,” 449&para;<br>U. S., at 162. “Neither the Florida Legislature by statute,&para;<br>nor the Florida courts by judicial decree,” we said, “may&para;<br>accomplish the result the county seeks simply by rechar&para;<br>acterizing the principal as ‘public money.’ ” Id., at 164.&para;<br>In sum, the Takings Clause bars the State from taking&para;<br>private property without paying for it, no matter which&para;<br>branch is the instrument of the taking. To be sure, the&para;<br>manner of state action may matter: Condemnation by&para;<br>eminent domain, for example, is always a taking, while a&para;<br>legislative, executive, or judicial restriction of property use&para;<br>may or may not be, depending on its nature and extent.&para;<br>But the particular state actor is irrelevant. If a legislature&para;<br>or a court declares that what was once an established&para;<br>right of private property no longer exists, it has taken that&para;<br>property, no less than if the State had physically appro&para;<br>priated it or destroyed its value by regulation. “[A] State,&para;<br>by ipse dixit, may not transform private property into&para;<br>public property without compensation.” Ibid.&para;<br>B&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER’s concurrence says that we need nei&para;<br>ther (1) to decide whether the judiciary can ever effect a&para;<br>taking, nor (2) to establish the standard for determining&para;<br>whether it has done so. See post, at 1–2 (opinion concur&para;<br>ring in part and concurring in judgment). The second part&para;<br>of this is surely incompatible with JUSTICE BREYER’s&para;<br>conclusion that the “Florida Supreme Court’s decision in&para;<br>this case did not amount to a ‘judicial taking.’ ” Post, at 3.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

That approach is invalid&para;<br>for the reasons we have discussed.&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY says that we need not take what he&para;<br>considers the bold and risky step of holding that the Tak&para;<br>ings Clause applies to judicial action, because the Due&para;<br>Process Clause “would likely prevent a State from doing&para;<br>by judicial decree what the Takings Clause forbids it to do&para;<br>by legislative fiat,” post, at 4–5 (opinion concurring in part&para;<br>and concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).

Because, he says, “[c]ourts,&para;<br>unlike the executive or legislature, are not designed to&para;<br>make policy decisions” about expropriation, “[t]he Court&para;<br>would be on strong footing in ruling that a judicial deci&para;<br>sion that eliminates or substantially changes established&para;<br>property rights” violates the Due Process Clause. Post, at&para;<br>4. Let us be clear what is being proposed here.

But in order to avoid the bold and risky&para;<br>step of saying that the Takings Clause applies to all gov&para;<br>ernment takings, JUSTICE KENNEDY would have us use&para;<br>Procedural Due Process to impose judicially crafted sepa&para;<br>ration-of-powers limitations upon the States: courts can&para;<br>not be used to perform the governmental function of ex&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

The asserted reasons for the due-process&para;<br>limitation are that the legislative and executive branches&para;<br>“are accountable in their political capacity” for takings,&para;<br>post, at 2, and “[c]ourts . . . are not designed to make policy&para;<br>decisions” about takings, post, at 4. These reasons may&para;<br>have a lot to do with sound separation-of-powers principles&para;<br>that ought to govern a democratic society, but they have&para;<br>nothing whatever to do with the protection of individual&para;<br>rights that is the object of the Due Process Clause.&para;<br>Of course even taking those reasons at face value, it is&para;<br>strange to proclaim a democracy deficit and lack of special&para;<br>competence for the judicial taking of an individual prop&para;<br>erty right, when this Court has had no trouble deciding&para;<br>matters of much greater moment, contrary to congres&para;<br>sional desire or the legislated desires of most of the States,&para;<br>with no special competence except the authority we pos&para;<br>sess to enforce the Constitution. In any case, our opinion&para;<br>does not trust judges with the relatively small power&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY now objects to. It is we who propose&para;<br>setting aside judicial decisions that take private property;&para;<br>it is he who insists that judges cannot be so limited. Un&para;<br>der his regime, the citizen whose property has been judi&para;<br>cially redefined to belong to the State would presumably&para;<br>be given the Orwellian explanation: “The court did not&para;<br>take your property. Because it is neither politically ac&para;<br>countable nor competent to make such a decision, it can&para;<br>not take property.”&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY’s injection of separation-of-powers&para;<br>principles into the Due Process Clause would also have the&para;<br>ironic effect of preventing the assignment of the expropria&para;<br>tion function to the branch of government whose proce&para;<br>dures are, by far, the most protective of individual rights.&para;<br>So perhaps even this first respect in which JUSTICE KENNEDY would have the Due Process Clause do the work of&para;<br>the Takings Clause pertains to Substantive, rather than&para;<br>Procedural, Due Process.

They&para;<br>doubtless did not, since the Constitution was adopted in&para;<br>an era when courts had no power to “change” the common&para;<br>law. See 1 Blackstone 69–70 (1765); Rogers v.

Of course&para;<br>even after courts, in the 19th century, did assume the&para;<br>power to change the common law, it is not true that the&para;<br>new “common-law tradition . . . allows for incremental&para;<br>modifications to property law,” post, at 4, so that “owners&para;<br>may reasonably expect or anticipate courts to make cer&para;<br>tain changes in property law,” post, at 6. In the only sense&para;<br>in which this could be relevant to what we are discussing,&para;<br>that is an astounding statement. We are talking here&para;<br>about judicial elimination of established private property&para;<br>rights.&para;<br>If that is indeed a “common-law tradition,”&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY ought to be able to provide a more solid&para;<br>example for it than the only one he cites, post, at 5, a&para;<br>state-court change (from “noxious” to “harmful”) of the test&para;<br>for determining whether a neighbor’s vegetation is a tor&para;<br>tious nuisance. Fancher v. Fagella, 274 Va. 549, 555–556,&para;<br>650 S. E. 2d 519, 522 (2007). But perhaps he does not&para;<br>really mean that it is a common-law tradition to eliminate&para;<br>property rights, since he immediately follows his state&para;<br>ment that “owners may reasonably expect or anticipate&para;<br>courts to make certain changes in property law” with the&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v.

If no “settled principl[e]” has&para;<br>been abandoned, it is hard to see how property law could&para;<br>have been “change[d],” rather than merely clarified.&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY has added “two additional practical&para;<br>considerations that the Court would need to address be&para;<br>fore recognizing judicial takings,” post, at 7. One of them&para;<br>is simple and simply answered: the assertion that “it is&para;<br>unclear what remedy a reviewing court could enter after&para;<br>finding a judicial taking,” post, at 8. JUSTICE KENNEDY&para;<br>worries that we may only be able to mandate compensa&para;<br>tion. That remedy is even rare for a legislative or execu&para;<br>tive taking, and we see no reason why it would be the&para;<br>exclusive remedy for a judicial taking. If we were to hold&para;<br>that the Florida Supreme Court had effected an uncom&para;<br>pensated taking in the present case, we would simply&para;<br>reverse the Florida Supreme Court’s judgment that the&para;<br>Beach and Shore Preservation Act can be applied to the&para;<br>property in question. JUSTICE KENNEDY’s other point,&para;<br>post, at 7–8—that we will have to decide when the claim of&para;<br>a judicial taking must be asserted—hardly presents an&para;<br>awe-inspiring prospect. These, and all the other “difficul&para;<br>ties,” post, at 1, “difficult questions,” post, at 5, and “prac&para;<br>tical considerations” post, at 7, that JUSTICE KENNEDY&para;<br>worries may perhaps stand in the way of recognizing a&para;<br>judicial taking, are either nonexistent or insignificant.&para;<br>Finally, we cannot avoid comment upon JUSTICE&para;<br>KENNEDY’s donning of the mantle of judicial restraint—&para;<br>his assertion that it is we, and not he, who would empower&para;<br>the courts and encourage their expropriation of private&para;<br>property. He warns that if judges know that their action&para;<br>is covered by the Takings Clause, they will issue “sweep&para;<br>ing new rule[s] to adjust the rights of property owners,”&para;<br>comfortable in the knowledge that their innovations will&para;<br>be preserved upon payment by the State. Post, at 6. That&para;<br>is quite impossible. As we have said, if we were to hold&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

We&para;<br>would simply reverse the Florida Supreme Court’s judg&para;<br>ment that the Beach and Shore Preservation Act can be&para;<br>applied to the Members’ property. The power to effect a&para;<br>compensated taking would then reside, where it has al&para;<br>ways resided, not in the Florida Supreme Court but in the&para;<br>Florida Legislature—which could either provide compen&para;<br>sation or acquiesce in the invalidity of the offending fea&para;<br>tures of the Act. Cf. Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury,&para;<br>489 U. S. 803, 817–818 (1989). The only realistic incentive&para;<br>that subjection to the Takings Clause might provide to any&para;<br>court would be the incentive to get reversed, which in our&para;<br>experience few judges value.&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY, however, while dismissive of the&para;<br>Takings Clause, places no other constraints on judicial&para;<br>action. He puts forward some extremely vague applica&para;<br>tions of Substantive Due Process, and does not even say&para;<br>that they (whatever they are) will for sure apply. (“It is&para;<br>thus natural to read the Due Process Clause as limiting&para;<br>the power of courts to eliminate or change established&para;<br>property rights,” post, at 3; “courts . . . may not have the&para;<br>power to eliminate established property rights by judicial&para;<br>decision,” post, at 4; “the Due Process Clause would likely&para;<br>prevent a State from doing by judicial decree what the&para;<br>Takings Clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat,” post, at&para;<br>4–5 (internal quotation marks omitted); we must defer&para;<br>applying the Takings Clause until “[i]f and when future&para;<br>cases show that the usual principles, including constitu&para;<br>tional principles that constrain the judiciary like due&para;<br>process, are somehow inadequate to protect property&para;<br>owners,” post, at 10.)&para;<br>Moreover, and more importantly, JUSTICE KENNEDY&para;<br>places no constraints whatever upon this Court. Not only&para;<br>does his concurrence only think about applying Substan&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- &para;<br>&para;<br>IDA DEPT.

Texas, 539 U.

JUSTICE&para;<br>KENNEDY’s desire to substitute Substantive Due Process&para;<br>for the Takings Clause suggests, and the rest of what he&para;<br>writes confirms, that what holds him back from giving the&para;<br>Takings Clause its natural meaning is not the intrusive&para;<br>ness of applying it to judicial action, but the definiteness of&para;<br>doing so; not a concern to preserve the powers of the&para;<br>States’ political branches, but a concern to preserve this&para;<br>Court’s discretion to say that property may be taken, or&para;<br>may not be taken, as in the Court’s view the circumstances&para;<br>suggest. We must not say that we are bound by the Con&para;<br>stitution never to sanction judicial elimination of clearly&para;<br>established property rights. Where the power of this&para;<br>Court is concerned, one must never say never. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 302–305 (2004) (plurality&para;<br>opinion); Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 750–751&para;<br>(2004) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in&para;<br>judgment). The great attraction of Substantive Due Proc&para;<br>ess as a substitute for more specific constitutional guaran&para;<br>tees is that it never means never—because it never means&para;<br>anything precise.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Respondents put forward a number of arguments which&para;<br>contradict, to a greater or lesser degree, the principle&para;<br>discussed above, that the existence of a taking does not&para;<br>depend upon the branch of government that effects it.&para;<br>First, in a case claiming a judicial taking they would add&para;<br>to our normal takings inquiry a requirement that the&para;<br>court’s decision have no “fair and substantial basis.” This&para;<br>is taken from our jurisprudence dealing with the question&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

See E. Gressman, K. Geller, S. Shapiro, T.&para;<br>Bishop, &amp; E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Practice, ch. 3.26,&para;<br>p. 222 (9th ed. 2007). To assure that there is no “evasion”&para;<br>of our authority to review federal questions, we insist that&para;<br>the nonfederal ground of decision have “fair support.”&para;<br>Broad River Power Co. v. South Carolina ex rel. Daniel,&para;<br>281 U. S. 537, 540 (1930); see also Ward v. Board of&para;<br>Comm’rs of Love Cty., 253 U. S. 17, 22–23 (1920). A test&para;<br>designed to determine whether there has been an evasion&para;<br>is not obviously appropriate for determining whether there&para;<br>has been a taking of property. But if it is to be extended&para;<br>there it must mean (in the present context) that there is a&para;<br>“fair and substantial basis” for believing that petitioner’s&para;<br>Members did not have a property right to future accretions&para;<br>which the Act would take away. This is no different, we&para;<br>think, from our requirement that petitioners’ Members&para;<br>must prove the elimination of an established property&para;<br>right.9&para;<br>Next, respondents argue that federal courts lack the&para;<br>knowledge of state law required to decide whether a judi&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 JUSTICE BREYER complains that we do not set forth “procedural limi&para;<br>tations or canons of deference” to restrict federal-court review of state&para;<br>court property decisions. See post, at 2. (1) To the extent this is true it&para;<br>is unsurprising, but (2) fundamentally, it is false: (1) It is true that we&para;<br>make our own determination, without deference to state judges,&para;<br>whether the challenged decision deprives the claimant of an established&para;<br>property right. That is unsurprising because it is what this Court does&para;<br>when determining state-court compliance with all constitutional&para;<br>imperatives. We do not defer to the judgment of state judges in deter&para;<br>mining whether, for example, a state-court decision has deprived a&para;<br>defendant of due process or subjected him to double jeopardy. (2) The&para;<br>test we have adopted, however (deprivation of an established property&para;<br>right), contains within itself a considerable degree of deference to state&para;<br>courts. A property right is not established if there is doubt about its&para;<br>existence; and when there is doubt we do not make our own assessment&para;<br>but accept the determination of the state court.&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v.

S. 564, 577–578 (1972) (Due Process Clause).&para;<br>And indeed they must decide it to resolve claims that&para;<br>legislative or executive action has effected a taking. For&para;<br>example, a regulation that deprives a property owner of all&para;<br>economically beneficial use of his property is not a taking&para;<br>if the restriction “inhere[s] in the title itself, in the restric&para;<br>tions that background principles of the State’s law of&para;<br>property and nuisance already place upon land owner&para;<br>ship.” Lucas, 505 U. S., at 1029. A constitutional provi&para;<br>sion that forbids the uncompensated taking of property is&para;<br>quite simply insusceptible of enforcement by federal courts&para;<br>unless they have the power to decide what property rights&para;<br>exist under state law.&para;<br>Respondents also warn us against depriving common&para;<br>law judging of needed flexibility. That argument has little&para;<br>appeal when directed against the enforcement of a consti&para;<br>tutional guarantee adopted in an era when, as we said&para;<br>supra, at 17, courts had no power to “change” the common&para;<br>law. But in any case, courts have no peculiar need of&para;<br>flexibility. It is no more essential that judges be free to&para;<br>overrule prior cases that establish property entitlements&para;<br>than that state legislators be free to revise pre-existing&para;<br>statutes that confer property entitlements, or agency&para;<br>heads pre-existing regulations that do so. And insofar as&para;<br>courts merely clarify and elaborate property entitlements&para;<br>that were previously unclear, they cannot be said to have&para;<br>taken an established property right.&para;<br>Finally, the city and county argue that applying the&para;<br>Takings Clause to judicial decisions would force lower&para;<br>federal courts to review final state-court judgments, in&para;<br>violation of the so-called Rooker-Feldman doctrine.

S. 172,&para;<br>186–194 (1985), would require the claimant to appeal a&para;<br>claimed taking by a lower court to the state supreme&para;<br>court, whence certiorari would come to this Court. If&para;<br>certiorari were denied, the claimant would no more be able&para;<br>to launch a lower-court federal suit against the taking&para;<br>effected by the state supreme-court opinion than he would&para;<br>be able to launch such a suit against a legislative or execu&para;<br>tive taking approved by the state supreme-court opinion;&para;<br>the matter would be res judicata. And where the claimant&para;<br>was not a party to the original suit, he would be able to&para;<br>challenge in federal court the taking effected by the state&para;<br>supreme-court opinion to the same extent that he would&para;<br>be able to challenge in federal court a legislative or execu&para;<br>tive taking previously approved by a state supreme-court&para;<br>opinion.&para;<br>For its part, petitioner proposes an unpredictability test.&para;<br>Quoting Justice Stewart’s concurrence in Hughes v. Wash&para;<br>ington, 389 U. S. 290, 296 (1967), petitioner argues that a&para;<br>judicial taking consists of a decision that “ ‘constitutes a&para;<br>sudden change in state law, unpredictable in terms of&para;<br>relevant precedents.’ ” See Brief for Petitioner 17, 34–50.&para;<br>The focus of petitioner’s test is misdirected. What counts&para;<br>is not whether there is precedent for the allegedly confis&para;<br>catory decision, but whether the property right allegedly&para;<br>taken was established. A “predictability of change” test&para;<br>would cover both too much and too little. Too much, be&para;<br>cause a judicial property decision need not be predictable,&para;<br>so long as it does not declare that what had been private&para;<br>property under established law no longer is. A decision&para;<br>that clarifies property entitlements (or the lack thereof)&para;<br>that were previously unclear might be difficult to predict,&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v.

And&para;<br>the predictability test covers too little, because a judicial&para;<br>elimination of established private-property rights that is&para;<br>foreshadowed by dicta or even by holdings years in ad&para;<br>vance is nonetheless a taking. If, for example, a state&para;<br>court held in one case, to which the complaining property&para;<br>owner was not a party, that it had the power to limit the&para;<br>acreage of privately owned real estate to 100 acres, and&para;<br>then, in a second case, applied that principle to declare the&para;<br>complainant’s 101st acre to be public property, the State&para;<br>would have taken an acre from the complainant even&para;<br>though the decision was predictable.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>We come at last to petitioner’s takings attack on the&para;<br>decision below. At the outset, respondents raise two pre&para;<br>liminary points which need not detain us long. The city&para;<br>and the county argue that petitioner cannot state a cause&para;<br>of action for a taking because, though the Members own&para;<br>private property, petitioner itself does not; and that the&para;<br>claim is unripe because petitioner has not sought just&para;<br>compensation. Neither objection appeared in the briefs in&para;<br>opposition to the petition for writ of certiorari, and since&para;<br>neither is jurisdictional,10 we deem both waived. See this&para;<br>Court’s Rule 15.2; cf. Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U. S.&para;<br>808, 815–816 (1985).&para;<br>Petitioner argues that the Florida Supreme Court took&para;<br>two of the property rights of the Members by declaring&para;<br>that those rights did not exist: the right to accretions, and&para;<br>the right to have littoral property touch the water (which&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 Petitioner meets the two requirements necessary for an association&para;<br>to assert the Article III standing of its Members. See Food and Com&para;<br>mercial Workers v. Brown Group, Inc., 517 U. S. 544, 555–557 (1996).&para;<br>And the claim here is ripe insofar as Article III standing is concerned,&para;<br>since (accepting petitioner’s version of Florida law as true) petitioner&para;<br>has been deprived of property.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>petitioner distinguishes from the mere right of access to&para;<br>the water).11 Under petitioner’s theory, because no prior&para;<br>Florida decision had said that the State’s filling of sub&para;<br>merged tidal lands could have the effect of depriving a&para;<br>littoral owner of contact with the water and denying him&para;<br>future accretions, the Florida Supreme Court’s judgment&para;<br>in the present case abolished those two easements to&para;<br>which littoral property owners had been entitled. This&para;<br>puts the burden on the wrong party. There is no taking&para;<br>unless petitioner can show that, before the Florida Su&para;<br>preme Court’s decision, littoral-property owners had rights&para;<br>to future accretions and contact with the water superior to&para;<br>the State’s right to fill in its submerged land. Though&para;<br>some may think the question close, in our view the show&para;<br>ing cannot be made.&para;<br>Two core principles of Florida property law intersect in&para;<br>this case. First, the State as owner of the submerged land&para;<br>adjacent to littoral property has the right to fill that land,&para;<br>so long as it does not interfere with the rights of the public&para;<br>and the rights of littoral landowners. See Hayes v. Bow&para;<br>man, 91 So. 2d 795, 799–800 (Fla. 1957) (right to fill con&para;<br>veyed by State to private party); State ex rel. Buford v.&para;<br>Tampa, 88 Fla. 196, 210–211, 102 So. 336, 341 (1924)&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 Petitioner&para;<br>&para;<br>raises two other claims that we do not directly address.&para;<br>First, petitioner tries to revive its challenge to the beach restoration&para;<br>project, contending that it (rather than the Florida Supreme Court’s&para;<br>opinion) constitutes a taking. Petitioner’s arguments on this score are&para;<br>simply versions of two arguments it makes against the Florida Su&para;<br>preme Court’s opinion: that the Department has replaced the Members’&para;<br>littoral property rights with versions that are inferior because statu&para;<br>tory; and that the Members previously had the right to have their&para;<br>property contact the water. We reject both, infra, at 28–29, and n. 12.&para;<br>Second, petitioner attempts to raise a challenge to the Act as a depriva&para;<br>tion of property without due process. Petitioner did not raise this&para;<br>challenge before the Florida Supreme Court, and only obliquely raised&para;<br>it in the petition for certiorari. We therefore do not reach it. See&para;<br>Adams, 520 U. S., at 86–87.&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- &para;<br>&para;<br>IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>(same). Second, as we described supra, at 3–4, if an avul&para;<br>sion exposes land seaward of littoral property that had&para;<br>previously been submerged, that land belongs to the State&para;<br>even if it interrupts the littoral owner’s contact with the&para;<br>water. See Bryant, 238 So. 2d, at 837, 838–839. The issue&para;<br>here is whether there is an exception to this rule when the&para;<br>State is the cause of the avulsion. Prior law suggests&para;<br>there is not. In Martin v. Busch, 93 Fla. 535, 112 So. 274&para;<br>(1927), the Florida Supreme Court held that when the&para;<br>State drained water from a lakebed belonging to the State,&para;<br>causing land that was formerly below the mean high&para;<br>water line to become dry land, that land continued to&para;<br>belong to the State. Id., at 574, 112 So., at 287; see also&para;<br>Bryant, supra, at 838–839 (analogizing the situation in&para;<br>Martin to an avulsion). “ ‘The riparian rights doctrine of&para;<br>accretion and reliction,’ ” the Florida Supreme Court later&para;<br>explained, “ ‘does not apply to such lands.’ ” Bryant, supra,&para;<br>at 839 (quoting Martin, supra, at 578, 112 So., at 288&para;<br>(Brown, J., concurring)). This is not surprising, as there can&para;<br>be no accretions to land that no longer abuts the water.&para;<br>Thus, Florida law as it stood before the decision below&para;<br>allowed the State to fill in its own seabed, and the result&para;<br>ing sudden exposure of previously submerged land was&para;<br>treated like an avulsion for purposes of ownership. The&para;<br>right to accretions was therefore subordinate to the State’s&para;<br>right to fill. Thiesen v. Gulf, Florida &amp; Alabama R. Co.&para;<br>suggests the same result. That case involved a claim by a&para;<br>riparian landowner that a railroad’s state-authorized&para;<br>filling of submerged land and construction of tracks upon&para;<br>it interfered with the riparian landowners’ rights to access&para;<br>and to wharf out to a shipping channel. The Florida Su&para;<br>preme Court determined that the claimed right to wharf&para;<br>out did not exist in Florida, and that therefore only the&para;<br>right of access was compensable. 75 Fla., at 58–65, 78 So.,&para;<br>at 501–503. Significantly, although the court recognized&para;<br>that the riparian-property owners had rights to accretion,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>27&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>see id., at 64–65, 78 So., at 502–503, the only rights it&para;<br>even suggested would be infringed by the railroad were&para;<br>the right of access (which the plaintiff had claimed) and&para;<br>the rights of view and use of the water (which it seems the&para;<br>plaintiff had not claimed), see id., at 58–59, 78, 78 So., at&para;<br>501, 507.&para;<br>The Florida Supreme Court decision before us is consis&para;<br>tent with these background principles of state property&para;<br>law. Cf. Lucas, 505 U. S., at 1028–1029; Scranton v.&para;<br>Wheeler, 179 U. S. 141, 163 (1900). It did not abolish the&para;<br>Members’ right to future accretions, but merely held that&para;<br>the right was not implicated by the beach-restoration&para;<br>project, because the doctrine of avulsion applied. See 998&para;<br>So. 2d, at 1117, 1120–1121. The Florida Supreme Court’s&para;<br>opinion describes beach restoration as the reclamation by&para;<br>the State of the public’s land, just as Martin had described&para;<br>the lake drainage in that case. Although the opinion does&para;<br>not cite Martin and is not always clear on this point, it&para;<br>suffices that its characterization of the littoral right to&para;<br>accretion is consistent with Martin and the other relevant&para;<br>principles of Florida law we have discussed.&para;<br>What we have said shows that the rule of Sand Key,&para;<br>which petitioner repeatedly invokes, is inapposite. There&para;<br>the Florida Supreme Court held that an artificial accretion&para;<br>does not change the right of a littoral-property owner to&para;<br>claim the accreted land as his own (as long as the owner&para;<br>did not cause the accretion himself). 512 So. 2d, at 937–&para;<br>938. The reason Martin did not apply, Sand Key ex&para;<br>plained, is that the drainage that had occurred in Martin&para;<br>did not lower the water level by “ ‘imperceptible degrees,’ ”&para;<br>and so did not qualify as an accretion. 512 So. 2d, at 940–&para;<br>941.&para;<br>The result under Florida law may seem counter&para;<br>intuitive. After all, the Members’ property has been de&para;<br>prived of its character (and value) as oceanfront property&para;<br>by the State’s artificial creation of an avulsion.

Even if there might be different&para;<br>interpretations of Martin and other Florida property-law&para;<br>cases that would prevent this arguably odd result, we are&para;<br>not free to adopt them.

To be clear, petitioner does&para;<br>not allege that the State relocated the property line, as&para;<br>would have happened if the erosion-control line were&para;<br>landward of the old mean high-water line (instead of&para;<br>identical to it). Petitioner argues instead that the Mem&para;<br>bers have a separate right for the boundary of their prop&para;<br>erty to be always the mean high-water line. Petitioner&para;<br>points to dicta in Sand Key that refers to “the right to have&para;<br>the property’s contact with the water remain intact,” 512&para;<br>So. 2d, at 936. Even there, the right was included in the&para;<br>definition of the right to access, ibid., which is consistent&para;<br>with the Florida Supreme Court’s later description that&para;<br>“there is no independent right of contact with the water”&para;<br>but it “exists to preserve the upland owner’s core littoral&para;<br>right of access to the water,” 998 So. 2d, at 1119.

This is a vast governmental power.&para;<br>And typically, legislative bodies grant substantial discre&para;<br>tion to executive officers to decide what property can be&para;<br>taken for authorized projects and uses. As a result, if an&para;<br>authorized executive agency or official decides that Black&para;<br>acre is the right place for a fire station or Greenacre is the&para;<br>best spot for a freeway interchange, then the weight and&para;<br>authority of the State are used to take the property, even&para;<br>against the wishes of the owner, who must be satisfied&para;<br>with just compensation.&para;<br>In the exercise of their duty to protect the fisc, both the&para;<br>legislative and executive branches monitor, or should&para;<br>monitor, the exercise of this substantial power. Those&para;<br>branches are accountable in their political capacity for the&para;<br>proper discharge of this obligation.&para;<br>To enable officials to better exercise this great power in&para;<br>a responsible way, some States allow their officials to take&para;<br>a second look after property has been condemned and a&para;<br>jury returns a verdict setting the amount of just compen&para;<br>sation. See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Proc.

The landowner is reimbursed for certain costs and&para;<br>expenses of litigation and the property remains in his or&para;<br>her hands. See, e.g., §1268.610(a).&para;<br>This is just one aspect of the exercise of the power to&para;<br>select what property to condemn and the responsibility to&para;<br>ensure that the taking makes financial sense from the&para;<br>State’s point of view.

The Due Process&para;<br>Clause, in both its substantive and procedural aspects, is a&para;<br>central limitation upon the exercise of judicial power. And&para;<br>this Court has long recognized that property regulations&para;<br>can be invalidated under the Due Process Clause. See,&para;<br>e.g., Lingle v. Chevron U. S. A. Inc., 544 U.

It is thus natural to read the Due&para;<br>Process Clause as limiting the power of courts to eliminate&para;<br>or change established property rights.&para;<br>The Takings Clause also protects property rights, and it&para;<br>“operates as a conditional limitation, permitting the gov&para;<br>ernment to do what it wants so long as it pays the charge.”&para;<br>Eastern Enterprises v.

Ibid.&para;<br>There is no clear authority for this proposition.&para;<br>When courts act without direction from the executive or&para;<br>legislature, they may not have the power to eliminate&para;<br>established property rights by judicial decision. “Given&para;<br>that the constitutionality” of a judicial decision altering&para;<br>property rights “appears to turn on the legitimacy” of&para;<br>whether the court’s judgment eliminates or changes estab&para;<br>lished property rights “rather than on the availability of&para;<br>compensation, . . . the more appropriate constitutional&para;<br>analysis arises under general due process principles&para;<br>rather than under the Takings Clause.” Ibid.

Thus, without a judicial takings&para;<br>doctrine, the Due Process Clause would likely prevent a&para;<br>State from doing “by judicial decree what the Takings&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

The&para;<br>objection that a due process claim might involve close&para;<br>questions concerning whether a judicial decree extends&para;<br>beyond what owners might have expected is not a sound&para;<br>argument; for the same close questions would arise with&para;<br>respect to whether a judicial decision is a taking. See&para;<br>Apfel, supra, at 541 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (“Cases&para;<br>attempting to decide when a regulation becomes a taking&para;<br>are among the most litigated and perplexing in current&para;<br>law”); Penn Central Transp. Co. v.

S. 104, 123 (1978) (“The question of what constitutes a&para;<br>‘taking’ for purposes of the Fifth Amendment has proved&para;<br>to be a problem of considerable difficulty”).&para;<br>To announce that courts too can effect a taking when&para;<br>they decide cases involving property rights, would raise&para;<br>certain difficult questions. Since this case does not require&para;<br>those questions to be addressed, in my respectful view, the&para;<br>Court should not reach beyond the necessities of the case&para;<br>to announce a sweeping rule that court decisions can be&para;<br>takings, as that phrase is used in the Takings Clause. The&para;<br>evident reason for recognizing a judicial takings doctrine&para;<br>would be to constrain the power of the judicial branch. Of&para;<br>course, the judiciary must respect private ownership. But&para;<br>were this Court to say that judicial decisions become&para;<br>takings when they overreach, this might give more power&para;<br>to courts, not less.&para;<br>Consider the instance of litigation between two property&para;<br>owners to determine which one bears the liability and&para;<br>costs when a tree that stands on one property extends its&para;<br>roots in a way that damages adjacent property. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Fancher v. Fagella, 274 Va. 549, 650 S.

The&para;<br>usual due process constraint is that courts cannot abandon&para;<br>settled principles. See, e.g., Rogers v. Tennessee, 532 U. S.&para;<br>451, 457 (2001) (citing Bouie v.

S., at 548–549 (opinion of&para;<br>KENNEDY, J.); see also Perry, supra, at 601; Roth, supra,&para;<br>at 577.&para;<br>But if the state court were deemed to be exercising the&para;<br>power to take property, that constraint would be removed.&para;<br>Because the State would be bound to pay owners for tak&para;<br>ings caused by a judicial decision, it is conceivable that&para;<br>some judges might decide that enacting a sweeping new&para;<br>rule to adjust the rights of property owners in the context&para;<br>of changing social needs is a good idea. Knowing that the&para;<br>resulting ruling would be a taking, the courts could go&para;<br>ahead with their project, free from constraints that would&para;<br>otherwise confine their power. The resulting judgment as&para;<br>between the property owners likely could not be set aside&para;<br>by some later enactment. See Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm,&para;<br>Inc., 514 U. S. 211, 217 (1995) (leaving open whether&para;<br>legislation reopening final judgments violates Due Process&para;<br>Clause). And if the litigation were a class action to decide,&para;<br>for instance, whether there are public rights of access that&para;<br>diminish the rights of private ownership, a State might&para;<br>find itself obligated to pay a substantial judgment for the&para;<br>judicial ruling. Even if the legislature were to subse&para;<br>quently rescind the judicial decision by statute, the State&para;<br>would still have to pay just compensation for the tempo&para;<br>rary taking that occurred from the time of the judicial&para;<br>decision to the time of the statutory fix. See First English,&para;<br>482 U.

The judiciary historically has not had the&para;<br>right or responsibility to say what property should or&para;<br>should not be taken.&para;<br>Indeed, it is unclear whether the Takings Clause was&para;<br>understood, as a historical matter, to apply to judicial&para;<br>decisions. The Framers most likely viewed this Clause as&para;<br>applying only to physical appropriation pursuant to the&para;<br>power of eminent domain. See Lucas v. South Carolina&para;<br>Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1028, n. 15 (1992). And it&para;<br>appears these physical appropriations were traditionally&para;<br>made by legislatures. See 3 J. Story, Commentaries on&para;<br>the Constitution of the United States §1784, p. 661 (1833).&para;<br>Courts, on the other hand, lacked the power of eminent&para;<br>domain. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 135 (W.&para;<br>Lewis ed. 1897). The Court’s Takings Clause jurispru&para;<br>dence has expanded beyond the Framers’ understanding,&para;<br>as it now applies to certain regulations that are not physi&para;<br>cal appropriations. See Lucas, supra, at 1014 (citing&para;<br>Mahon, 260 U. S. 393). But the Court should consider&para;<br>with care the decision to extend the Takings Clause in&para;<br>a manner that might be inconsistent with historical&para;<br>practice.&para;<br>There are two additional practical considerations that&para;<br>the Court would need to address before recognizing judi&para;<br>cial takings. First, it may be unclear in certain situations&para;<br>how a party should properly raise a judicial takings claim.&para;<br>“[I]t is important to separate out two judicial actions—the&para;<br>decision to change current property rules in a way that&para;<br>would constitute a taking, and the decision to require&para;<br>compensation.”&para;<br>Thompson, Judicial Takings, 76 Va.&para;<br>L. Rev. 1449, 1515 (1990). In some contexts, these issues&para;<br>could arise separately. For instance, assume that a state&para;<br>court opinion explicitly holds that it is changing state&para;<br>property law, or that it asserts that is not changing the&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- &para;<br>&para;<br>IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>law but there is no “fair or substantial basis” for this&para;<br>statement. Broad River, 281 U. S., at 540. (Most of these&para;<br>cases may arise in the latter posture, like inverse condem&para;<br>nation claims where the State says it is not taking prop&para;<br>erty and pays no compensation.) Call this Case A. The&para;<br>only issue in Case A was determining the substance of&para;<br>state property law. It is doubtful that parties would raise&para;<br>a judicial takings claim on appeal, or in a petition for a&para;<br>writ of certiorari, in Case A, as the issue would not have&para;<br>been litigated below. Rather, the party may file a sepa&para;<br>rate lawsuit—Case B—arguing that a taking occurred in&para;<br>light of the change in property law made by Case A. After&para;<br>all, until the state court in Case A changes the law, the&para;<br>party will not know if his or her property rights will have&para;<br>been eliminated. So res judicata probably would not bar&para;<br>the party from litigating the takings issue in Case B.&para;<br>Second, it is unclear what remedy a reviewing court&para;<br>could enter after finding a judicial taking. It appears&para;<br>under our precedents that a party who suffers a taking is&para;<br>only entitled to damages, not equitable relief: The Court&para;<br>has said that “[e]quitable relief is not available to enjoin&para;<br>an alleged taking of private property for a public use . . .&para;<br>when a suit for compensation can be brought against the&para;<br>sovereign subsequent to the taking,” Ruckelshaus v. Mon&para;<br>santo Co., 467 U. S. 986, 1016 (1984), and the Court sub&para;<br>sequently held that the Takings Clause requires the avail&para;<br>ability of a suit for compensation against the States, First&para;<br>English, supra, at 321–322. It makes perfect sense that&para;<br>the remedy for a Takings Clause violation is only dam&para;<br>ages, as the Clause “does not proscribe the taking of prop&para;<br>erty; it proscribes taking without just compensation.”&para;<br>Williamson County Regional Planning Comm’n v. Hamil&para;<br>ton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172, 194 (1985).&para;<br>It is thus questionable whether reviewing courts could&para;<br>invalidate judicial decisions deemed to be judicial takings;&para;<br>they may only be able to order just compensation. In the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>posture discussed above where Case A changes the law&para;<br>and Case B addresses whether that change is a taking, it&para;<br>is not clear how the Court, in Case B, could invalidate the&para;<br>holding of Case A. If a single case were to properly ad&para;<br>dress both a state court’s change in the law and whether&para;<br>the change was a taking, the Court might be able to give&para;<br>the state court a choice on how to proceed if there were a&para;<br>judicial taking. The Court might be able to remand and&para;<br>let the state court determine whether it wants to insist on&para;<br>changing its property law and paying just compensation or&para;<br>to rescind its holding that changed the law. Cf. First&para;<br>English, 482 U. S., at 321 (“Once a court determines that a&para;<br>taking has occurred, the government retains the whole&para;<br>range of options already available—amendment of the&para;<br>regulation, withdrawal of the invalidated regulation, or&para;<br>exercise of eminent domain”). But that decision would&para;<br>rest with the state court, not this Court; so the state court&para;<br>could still force the State to pay just compensation. And&para;<br>even if the state court decided to rescind its decision that&para;<br>changed the law, a temporary taking would have occurred&para;<br>in the interim. See ibid.&para;<br>These difficult issues are some of the reasons why the&para;<br>Court should not reach beyond the necessities of the case&para;<br>to recognize a judicial takings doctrine. It is not wise,&para;<br>from an institutional standpoint, to reach out and decide&para;<br>questions that have not been discussed at much length by&para;<br>courts and commentators. This Court’s dicta in William&para;<br>son County, supra, at 194–197, regarding when regulatory&para;<br>takings claims become ripe, explains why federal courts&para;<br>have not been able to provide much analysis on the issue&para;<br>of judicial takings.

I cannot join Parts II and III, how&para;<br>ever, for in those Parts the plurality unnecessarily ad&para;<br>dresses questions of constitutional law that are better left&para;<br>for another day.&para;<br>In Part II of its opinion, see ante, at 7–10, the plurality&para;<br>concludes that courts, including federal courts, may review&para;<br>the private property law decisions of state courts to de&para;<br>termine whether the decisions unconstitutionally take&para;<br>“private property” for “public use without just compensa&para;<br>tion.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. And in doing so it finds&para;<br>“irrelevant” that the “particular state actor” that takes&para;<br>private property (or unconstitutionally redefines state&para;<br>property law) is the judicial branch, rather than the ex&para;<br>ecutive or legislative branch. Ante, at 10; cf. Hughes v.&para;<br>Washington, 389 U. S. 290, 296–298 (1967) (Stewart, J.,&para;<br>concurring).&para;<br>In Part III, the plurality determines that it is “not obvi&para;<br>ously appropriate” to apply this Court’s “ ‘fair and substan&para;<br>tial basis’ ” test, familiar from our adequate and independ&para;<br>ent state ground jurisprudence, when evaluating whether&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>STOP THE BEACH RENOURISHMENT, INC. v. FLOR- &para;<br>&para;<br>IDA DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>a state-court property decision enacts an unconstitutional&para;<br>taking. Ante, at 21. The plurality further concludes that a&para;<br>state-court decision violates the Takings Clause not when&para;<br>the decision is “unpredictab[le]” on the basis of prior law,&para;<br>but rather when the decision takes private property rights&para;<br>that are “established.” Ante, at 23–24. And finally, it&para;<br>concludes that all those affected by a state-court property&para;<br>law decision can raise a takings claim in federal court, but&para;<br>for the losing party in the initial state-court proceeding,&para;<br>who can only raise her claim (possibly for the first time) in&para;<br>a petition for a writ of certiorari here. Ante, at 23.&para;<br>I do not claim that all of these conclusions are unsound.&para;<br>I do not know. But I do know that, if we were to express&para;<br>our views on these questions, we would invite a host of&para;<br>federal takings claims without the mature consideration of&para;<br>potential procedural or substantive legal principles that&para;<br>might limit federal interference in matters that are pri&para;<br>marily the subject of state law. Property owners litigate&para;<br>many thousands of cases involving state property law in&para;<br>state courts each year. Each state-court property decision&para;<br>may further affect numerous nonparty property owners as&para;<br>well. Losing parties in many state-court cases may well&para;<br>believe that erroneous judicial decisions have deprived&para;<br>them of property rights they previously held and may&para;<br>consequently bring federal takings claims. And a glance&para;<br>at Part IV makes clear that such cases can involve state&para;<br>property law issues of considerable complexity. Hence, the&para;<br>approach the plurality would take today threatens to open&para;<br>the federal court doors to constitutional review of many,&para;<br>perhaps large numbers of, state-law cases in an area of&para;<br>law familiar to state, but not federal, judges. And the&para;<br>failure of that approach to set forth procedural limitations&para;<br>or canons of deference would create the distinct possibility&para;<br>that federal judges would play a major role in the shaping&para;<br>of a matter of significant state interest—state property&para;<br>law.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>The plurality criticizes me for my cautious approach,&para;<br>and states that I “cannot decide that petitioner’s claim&para;<br>fails without first deciding what a valid claim would con&para;<br>sist of.” Ante, at 12. But, of course, courts frequently find&para;<br>it possible to resolve cases—even those raising constitu&para;<br>tional questions—without specifying the precise standard&para;<br>under which a party wins or loses. See, e.g., Smith v.&para;<br>Spisak, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 16) (“With or&para;<br>without such deference, our conclusion is the same”);&para;<br>Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U. S. 246, 256 (1978) (rejecting an&para;<br>equal protection claim “[u]nder any standard of review”);&para;<br>Mercer v. Theriot, 377 U. S. 152, 156 (1964) (per curiam)&para;<br>(finding evidence sufficient to support a verdict “under any&para;<br>standard”). That is simply what I would do here.&para;<br>In the past, Members of this Court have warned us that,&para;<br>when faced with difficult constitutional questions, we&para;<br>should “confine ourselves to deciding only what is neces&para;<br>sary to the disposition of the immediate case.” Whitehouse&para;<br>v. Illinois Central R. Co., 349 U. S. 366, 373 (1955); see&para;<br>also Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn.,&para;<br>485 U. S. 439, 445 (1988) (“A fundamental and longstand&para;<br>ing principle of judicial restraint requires that courts&para;<br>avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the&para;<br>necessity of deciding them”); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S.&para;<br>288, 346–347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (“The Court&para;<br>will not anticipate a question of constitutional law in&para;<br>advance of the necessity of deciding it.

I heed&para;<br>this advice here. There is no need now to decide more&para;<br>than what the Court decides in Parts IV and V, namely,&para;<br>that the Florida Supreme Court’s decision in this case did&para;<br>not amount to a “judicial taking.”&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
