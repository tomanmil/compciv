OTIS LEE RODGERS&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 12–382.&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided April 1, 2013&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>Respondent Otis Lee Rodgers, challenging his state conviction, sought a writ of habeas corpus from the United&para;<br>States District Court for the Central District of California.&para;<br>He claimed the state courts violated his Sixth Amendment&para;<br>right to effective assistance of counsel by declining to appoint an attorney to assist in filing a motion for a new&para;<br>trial notwithstanding his three prior waivers of the right&para;<br>to counseled representation. The District Court denied&para;<br>respondent’s petition, and he appealed to the Court of&para;<br>Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which granted habeas&para;<br>relief. 678 F. 3d 1149, 1163 (2012). Because the Court&para;<br>of Appeals erred in concluding that respondent’s claim is&para;<br>supported by “clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,” 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2254(d)(1), its judgment must be reversed.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 2001, the State of California charged respondent with&para;<br>making criminal threats, assault with a firearm, and being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.&para;<br>Before his arraignment, respondent executed a valid&para;<br>waiver of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, electing&para;<br>to represent himself. See Faretta v. California, 422 U. S.&para;<br>806, 807 (1975). By the time of his preliminary hearing,&para;<br>however, respondent changed his mind and retained counsel. Then, two months later, he fired his lawyer and again&para;<br>waived his right to counsel. Two months after that, respondent again changed his mind and asked the court to&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MARSHALL v. RODGERS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>appoint an attorney. The court did so. Shortly before&para;<br>trial, however, respondent for the third time surrendered&para;<br>his right to counsel. He proceeded to trial pro se. On June&para;<br>27, 2003, the jury returned a verdict of guilty.&para;<br>After the verdict was read, respondent asked the state&para;<br>trial court to provide an attorney to help him file a motion&para;<br>for a new trial. The trial judge deferred ruling on the&para;<br>motion to appoint counsel, and respondent later renewed&para;<br>the request in writing. Neither the oral nor the written&para;<br>motion included reasons in support of his request; and&para;<br>when offered a chance to supplement or explain his motion&para;<br>at a later hearing, respondent declined to do so. The trial&para;<br>court denied the request for counsel. Respondent’s pro se&para;<br>motion for a new trial was likewise denied.&para;<br>On direct review the California Court of Appeal affirmed&para;<br>respondent’s convictions and sentence. As relevant here,&para;<br>it concluded that his history of vacillating between counseled and self-representation, the lack of support for his&para;<br>motion, his demonstrated competence in defending his&para;<br>case, and his insistence that he “ ‘c[ould] do the motion&para;<br>[him]self ’ ” but “ ‘just need[ed] time to perfect it,’ ” App.&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert. 129–130, justified the trial court’s denial&para;<br>of his post-trial request for counsel. The state appellate&para;<br>court also distinguished its decision from that of the Court&para;<br>of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Menefield v. Borg, 881&para;<br>F. 2d 696 (1989), reasoning that the habeas petitioner&para;<br>in Menefield had stated reasons justifying his request&para;<br>for counsel, whereas respondent’s request was unreasoned&para;<br>and unexplained. The state appellate court concluded that&para;<br>“[b]ecause the [trial] court was not given any reason to&para;<br>grant [respondent’s] motion, we cannot find that the court&para;<br>abused its discretion in declining to do so.” App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 130.&para;<br>Having failed to obtain relief in state court, respondent&para;<br>filed a federal habeas petition, arguing that the California&para;<br>courts had violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>by not providing an attorney to help with his new-trial&para;<br>motion. The District Court denied the petition but granted&para;<br>a certificate of appealability. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent’s “Sixth Amendment&para;<br>right to counsel was violated when the trial court denied&para;<br>his timely request for representation for a new trial motion.” 678 F. 3d, at 1163.&para;<br>To reach the conclusion that respondent’s right to counsel in these circumstances was clearly established by the&para;<br>Supreme Court of the United States, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>for the Ninth Circuit invoked certain Sixth Amendment&para;<br>precedents from its own earlier cases and from cases in&para;<br>other Circuits. From those precedents, the panel identified two relevant principles that it deemed to have been&para;<br>clearly established by this Court’s cases: first, that a defendant’s waiver of his right to trial counsel does not bar&para;<br>his later election to receive assistance of counsel at a later&para;<br>critical stage of the prosecution, absent proof by the State&para;<br>that the reappointment request was made in bad faith, see&para;<br>id., at 1159–1162; and, second, that a new-trial motion is a&para;<br>critical stage, see id., at 1156–1159. Combining these two&para;<br>propositions, the court held that respondent had a clearly&para;<br>established right to the reappointment of counsel for&para;<br>purposes of his new-trial motion, and that the California&para;<br>courts—which vest the trial judge with discretion to approve or deny such requests based on the totality of the&para;<br>circumstances, see People v. Lawley, 27 Cal. 4th 102, 147–&para;<br>151, 38 P. 3d 461, 493–495 (2002)—violated that right by&para;<br>refusing to order the reappointment of counsel. 678 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 1162–1163.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The starting point for cases subject to §2254(d)(1) is to&para;<br>identify the “clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States” that&para;<br>governs the habeas petitioner’s claims. See Williams v.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MARSHALL v. RODGERS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000); Knowles v. Mirzayance,&para;<br>556 U. S. 111, 122 (2009). As indicated above, the parties&para;<br>here dispute whether two principles of law are clearly&para;<br>established under this framework. One is whether, after a&para;<br>defendant’s valid waiver of his right to trial counsel under&para;<br>Faretta, a post-trial, preappeal motion for a new trial is a&para;<br>critical stage of the prosecution. For purposes of analysis&para;<br>here, it will be assumed, without so holding, that it is.&para;<br>The other disputed question is whether, after a defendant’s valid waiver of counsel, a trial judge has discretion&para;<br>to deny the defendant’s later request for reappointment of&para;<br>counsel. In resolving this question in respondent’s favor,&para;<br>the Court of Appeals first concluded (correctly) that “the&para;<br>Supreme Court has never explicitly addressed a criminal&para;<br>defendant’s ability to re-assert his right to counsel” once&para;<br>he has validly waived it. 678 F. 3d, at 1159 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). It then (also correctly) recognized that the lack of a Supreme Court decision on nearly&para;<br>identical facts does not by itself mean that there is no&para;<br>clearly established federal law, since “a general standard”&para;<br>from this Court’s cases can supply such law. Yarborough&para;<br>v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 664 (2004). The Court of Appeals erred, however, in its application of this latter proposition to the controlling issues here.&para;<br>It is beyond dispute that “[t]he Sixth Amendment safeguards to an accused who faces incarceration the right to&para;<br>counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process.” Iowa&para;<br>v. Tovar, 541 U. S. 77, 80–81 (2004); see United States v.&para;<br>Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 653–654 (1984); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 344 (1963). It is just as well settled,&para;<br>however, that a defendant also has the right to “proceed&para;<br>without counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently&para;<br>elects to do so.” Faretta, 422 U. S., at 807.&para;<br>There can be some tension in these two principles. As&para;<br>the Faretta Court observed, “[t]here can be no blinking the&para;<br>fact that the right of an accused to conduct his own de-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>fense seems to cut against the grain of this Court’s decisions holding that the Constitution requires that no&para;<br>accused can be convicted and imprisoned unless he has&para;<br>been accorded the right to the assistance of counsel.” Id.,&para;<br>at 832. California has resolved this tension by adopting&para;<br>the framework under review. Under that approach, trial&para;<br>judges are afforded discretion when considering postwaiver&para;<br>requests for counsel; their decisions on such requests&para;<br>must be based on the totality of the circumstances, “includ[ing] ‘the quality of [the defendant’s] representation&para;<br>of [himself], the defendant’s prior proclivity to substitute&para;<br>counsel, the reasons for the request, the length and stage&para;<br>of the proceedings, and the disruption or delay [that]&para;<br>might reasonably be expected to follow the granting of&para;<br>such a motion.’ ” Lawley, supra, at 149, 38 P. 3d, at 494&para;<br>(quoting People v. Windham, 19 Cal. 3d 121, 128, 560&para;<br>P. 2d 1187, 1191–1192 (1977); final alteration in original).&para;<br>The state appellate court applied those rules to the case at&para;<br>bar, concluding that the totality of the circumstances—and&para;<br>especially the shifting nature of respondent’s preferences,&para;<br>the unexplained nature of his motion, and his demonstrated&para;<br>capacity to handle the incidents of trial—supported the&para;<br>trial court’s decision. App. to Pet. for Cert. 128–131.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals, however, has resolved that tension differently in its own direct-review cases. It has&para;<br>adopted a “ ‘strong presumption that a defendant’s posttrial request for the assistance of an attorney should not&para;<br>be refused,’ ” 678 F. 3d, at 1160 (quoting Robinson v. Ignacio, 360 F. 3d 1044, 1058 (CA9 2004); emphasis deleted),&para;<br>as well as a default rule that, “ ‘in the absence of extraordinary circumstances,’ a defendant’s post-trial revocation&para;<br>of his waiver should be allowed unless the government can&para;<br>show that the request is made ‘for a bad faith purpose,’ ”&para;<br>id., at 1058 (quoting Menefield, 881 F. 2d, at 701; emphasis deleted).&para;<br>It is unnecessary for present purposes to judge the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MARSHALL v. RODGERS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>merits of these two approaches or determine what rule the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment in fact establishes for postwaiver requests of appointment of counsel. All this case requires—&para;<br>and all the Court of Appeals was empowered to do under&para;<br>§2254(d)(1)—is to observe that, in light of the tension&para;<br>between the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of “the right&para;<br>to counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process,”&para;<br>Tovar, supra, at 80–81, and its concurrent promise of “a&para;<br>constitutional right to proceed without counsel when [a&para;<br>criminal defendant] voluntarily and intelligently elects to&para;<br>do so,” Faretta, supra, at 807, it cannot be said that California’s approach is contrary to or an unreasonable application of the “general standard[s]” established by the&para;<br>Court’s assistance-of-counsel cases. Alvarado, supra, at&para;<br>664.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals’ contrary conclusion rested in part&para;<br>on the mistaken belief that circuit precedent may be used&para;<br>to refine or sharpen a general principle of Supreme Court&para;<br>jurisprudence into a specific legal rule that this Court has&para;<br>not announced. Parker v. Matthews, 567 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2012) ( per curiam) (slip op., at 12–13) (“The highly generalized standard for evaluating claims of prosecutorial&para;<br>misconduct set forth in Darden [v. Wainwright, 477 U. S.&para;<br>168 (1986)] bears scant resemblance to the elaborate,&para;<br>multistep test employed by the Sixth Circuit here”); see&para;<br>678 F. 3d, at 1155, 1157. The error in this approach is&para;<br>subtle, yet substantial. Although an appellate panel may,&para;<br>in accordance with its usual law-of-the-circuit procedures,&para;<br>look to circuit precedent to ascertain whether it has already held that the particular point in issue is clearly&para;<br>established by Supreme Court precedent, see, e.g., Tolliver&para;<br>v. Sheets, 594 F. 3d 900, 916, n. 6 (CA6 2010) (“We are&para;<br>bound by prior Sixth Circuit determinations that a rule&para;<br>has been clearly established”); Chambers v. McDaniel, 549&para;<br>F. 3d 1191, 1199 (CA9 2008), it may not canvass circuit&para;<br>decisions to determine whether a particular rule of law is&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>so widely accepted among the Federal Circuits that it&para;<br>would, if presented to this Court, be accepted as correct.&para;<br>See Parker, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 12–13); Renico v.&para;<br>Lett, 559 U. S. 766, 778–779 (2010). The Court of Appeals&para;<br>failed to abide by that limitation here. Its resulting holding was erroneous and must be reversed.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Court expresses no view on the merits of the underlying Sixth Amendment principle the respondent urges.&para;<br>And it does not suggest or imply that the underlying issue,&para;<br>if presented on direct review, would be insubstantial. This&para;<br>opinion is instead confined to the determination that the&para;<br>conclusion of the California courts that there was no Sixth&para;<br>Amendment violation is not contrary to “clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court&para;<br>of the United States.” §2254(d)(1).&para;<br>The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s&para;<br>motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The&para;<br>judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for&para;<br>further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
