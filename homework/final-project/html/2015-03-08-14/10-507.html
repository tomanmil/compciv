Employee Juan&para;<br>Valladolid spent 98 percent of his time working on an offshore platform, but he was killed in an accident while working at the onshore&para;<br>facility. His widow, a respondent here, sought benefits under the&para;<br>Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33&para;<br>U. S. C. §901 et seq., pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands&para;<br>Act (OCSLA), which extends LHWCA coverage to injuries “occurring&para;<br>as the result of operations conducted on the [OCS]” for the purpose of&para;<br>extracting natural resources from the shelf, 43 U. S. C. §1333(b). The&para;<br>Administrative Law Judge dismissed her claim, reasoning that&para;<br>§1333(b) did not cover Valladolid’s fatal injury because his accident&para;<br>occurred on land, not on the OCS. The Labor Department’s Benefits&para;<br>Review Board affirmed, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. Rejecting&para;<br>tests used by the Third and the Fifth Circuits, the Ninth Circuit concluded that a claimant seeking benefits under the OCSLA “must establish a substantial nexus between the injury and extractive operations on the shelf.”&para;<br>Held: The OCSLA extends coverage to an employee who can establish a&para;<br>substantial nexus between his injury and his employer’s extractive&para;<br>operations on the OCS. Pp. 3–14.&para;<br>(a) The Courts of Appeals have offered competing interpretations of&para;<br>§1333(b)’s scope. According to the Third Circuit, because Congress&para;<br>intended LHWCA coverage to be expansive, §1333(b) extends to all&para;<br>injuries that would not have occurred “but for” operations on the&para;<br>OCS. Thus, an employee who worked on a semisubmersible drill rig,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>but who died in a car accident on his way to board a helicopter to be&para;<br>flown to the rig, was eligible for benefits because he would not have&para;<br>been injured but for his traveling to the rig. In contrast, the Fifth&para;<br>Circuit has concluded that Congress intended to establish “a brightline geographic boundary,” extending §1333(b) coverage only to employees whose injuries or death occurred on an OCS platform or the&para;<br>waters above the OCS. Under its “situs-of-injury” test, a welder injured on land while constructing an offshore oil platform was ineligible for §1333(b) benefits. In the decision below, the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>held that §1333(b) extends coverage to injured workers who can establish a “substantial nexus” between their injury and extractive operations on the OCS. The Solicitor General offers a fourth interpretation, which would provide coverage for off-OCS injuries only to&para;<br>those employees whose duties contribute to operations on the OCS&para;<br>and who perform work on the OCS itself that is substantial in both&para;<br>duration and nature. Pp. 3–6.&para;<br>(b) Contrary to Pacific’s position, the Fifth Circuit’s “situs-of-injury”&para;<br>test is not the best interpretation of §1333(b). Pp. 6–12.&para;<br>(1) Nothing in the text of §1333(b) suggests that an injury must&para;<br>occur on the OCS. The provision has only two requirements: The extractive operations must be “conducted on the [OCS],” and the employee’s injury must occur “as the result of” those operations. If, as&para;<br>Pacific suggests, the purpose of §1333(b) was to geographically limit&para;<br>the scope of OCSLA coverage to injuries that occur on the OCS, Congress could easily have achieved that goal by omitting from §1333(b)&para;<br>the words “as the result of operations conducted.” Moreover, Congress’ decision to specify situs limitations in other subsections, but&para;<br>not in §1333(b), indicates that it did not intend to so limit §1333(b).&para;<br>This conclusion is not foreclosed by Herb’s Welding, Inc. v. Gray, 470&para;<br>U. S. 414, or Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 U. S. 207, neither of which held that §1333(b) coverage was limited to on-OCS injuries. Section 1333(b)’s text also gives no indication that Congress&para;<br>intended to exclude OCS workers who are eligible for state benefits&para;<br>from LHWCA coverage. To the contrary, the LHWCA scheme incorporated by the OCSLA explicitly anticipates that injured employees&para;<br>might be eligible for both state and federal benefits. Pp. 6–10.&para;<br>(2) Also unpersuasive is Pacific’s alternative argument that&para;<br>§1333(b) imports the LHWCA’s strict situs-of-injury requirement,&para;<br>which provides benefits only for injuries occurring “upon the navigable waters” of the United States, 33 U. S. C. §903(a). It is unlikely&para;<br>that Congress intended to restrict the scope of the OCSLA workers’&para;<br>compensation scheme through a nonintuitive and convoluted combination of two separate legislative Acts. In addition, under Pacific’s&para;<br>alternative theory, LHWCA coverage would not be extended to the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>navigable waters above the shelf. Thus, even employees on a crew&para;<br>ship immediately adjacent to an OCS platform who are injured in a&para;<br>platform explosion would be excluded from §1333(b) coverage. That&para;<br>view cannot be squared with §1333(b)’s language. Pp. 11–12.&para;<br>(3) Pacific’s policy concerns also cannot justify an interpretation&para;<br>of §1333(b) that is inconsistent with the OCSLA’s text. P. 12.&para;<br>(c) Neither the Solicitor General’s status-based inquiry nor the&para;<br>Third Circuit’s “but for” test are compatible with §1333(b). The Solicitor General’s inquiry has no basis in the OCSLA’s text, because&para;<br>§1333(b)’s “occurring as the result of operations” language plainly&para;<br>suggests causation. And when taken to its logical conclusion, the&para;<br>Third Circuit’s test, though nominally based on causation, is essentially a status-based inquiry because it would extend coverage to all&para;<br>employees of a business engaged in extracting natural resources from&para;<br>the OCS, no matter where those employees work or what they are doing at the time of injury. Because LHWCA coverage was extended&para;<br>only to injuries “occurring as the result of operations conducted on&para;<br>the [OCS],” §1333(b)’s focus should be on injuries resulting from&para;<br>those “operations.” Pp. 12–14.&para;<br>(d) The Ninth Circuit’s “substantial-nexus” test is more faithful to&para;<br>§1333(b)’s text. This Court understands that test to require the injured employee to establish a significant causal link between his injury and his employer’s on-OCS extractive operations. The test may&para;<br>not be the easiest to administer, but Administrative Law Judges and&para;<br>courts should be able to determine if an injured employee has established the required significant causal link. Whether an employee injured while performing an off-OCS task qualifies will depend on the&para;<br>circumstances of each case. It was thus proper for the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>to remand this case for the Benefits Review Board to apply the “substantial-nexus” test.

Pacific&para;<br>employed Juan Valladolid as a general manual laborer—&para;<br>known in the trade as a roustabout—in its oil exploration&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and extraction business. Valladolid spent about 98 percent of his time on one of Pacific’s offshore drilling platforms performing maintenance duties, such as picking up&para;<br>litter, emptying trashcans, washing decks, painting, maintaining equipment, and helping to load and unload the&para;<br>platform crane. Valladolid spent the remainder of his&para;<br>time working at Pacific’s onshore processing facility,&para;<br>where he also performed maintenance duties, including&para;<br>painting, sandblasting, pulling weeds, cleaning drain culverts, and operating a forklift.&para;<br>While on duty at the onshore facility, Valladolid died in&para;<br>a forklift accident. His widow, a respondent here, filed a&para;<br>claim for benefits under the LHWCA pursuant to the&para;<br>extension of that Act contained within the OCSLA. The&para;<br>OCSLA provides, in relevant part:&para;<br>“With respect to disability or death of an employee&para;<br>resulting from any injury occurring as the result of&para;<br>operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf&para;<br>for the purpose of exploring for, developing, removing,&para;<br>or transporting by pipeline the natural resources, or&para;<br>involving rights to the natural resources, of the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf, compensation shall be payable under the provisions of the&para;<br>[LHWCA].” 43 U.

The ALJ reasoned that&para;<br>Valladolid’s fatal injury was not covered under §1333(b)&para;<br>because his accident occurred on land, rather than on the&para;<br>Outer Continental Shelf. On appeal, the United States&para;<br>Department of Labor’s Benefits Review Board affirmed,&para;<br>concluding that Congress intended to limit the coverage&para;<br>provided by the OCSLA to injuries suffered by employees&para;<br>within the “geographical locale” of the Outer Continental&para;<br>Shelf.

See 604 F. 3d&para;<br>1126, 1130–1140 (2010) (rejecting the holdings of Mills v.&para;<br>Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, 877&para;<br>F. 2d 356 (CA5 1989) (en banc); Curtis v.

We granted Pacific’s petition for a writ of certiorari&para;<br>to resolve this conflict. 562 U. S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>In 1953, Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act, 67&para;<br>Stat. 29, 43 U. S. C. §1301 et seq., which extended the&para;<br>boundaries of Coastal States three geographic miles into&para;<br>the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and three marine leagues&para;<br>into the Gulf of Mexico. At the same time, Congress enacted the OCSLA, affirming the Federal Government’s&para;<br>authority and control over the “outer Continental Shelf,”&para;<br>defined as the submerged lands subject to the jurisdiction&para;<br>and control of the United States lying seaward and outside&para;<br>of the submerged lands within the extended State boundaries. 67 Stat. 462, 43 U. S. C. §§1331(a), 1332(1). As&para;<br>defined by the OCSLA, the Outer Continental Shelf includes the “submerged lands” beyond the extended state&para;<br>boundaries, §1331(a), but not the waters above those&para;<br>submerged lands or artificial islands or installations&para;<br>attached to the seabed. For simplicity’s sake, we refer to&para;<br>the entire geographical zone as the “OCS.”&para;<br>Section 1333 extends various provisions of state and&para;<br>federal law to certain aspects of the OCS. For example,&para;<br>§1333(a)(1) extends the Constitution and federal laws of&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>civil and political jurisdiction “to the subsoil and seabed of&para;<br>the outer Continental Shelf and to all artificial islands,&para;<br>and all installations and other devices permanently or&para;<br>temporarily attached to the seabed,” for the purpose of&para;<br>extracting its natural resources. Section 1333(a)(2)(A)&para;<br>makes the civil and criminal laws of each adjacent State&para;<br>applicable to “that portion of the subsoil and seabed of the&para;<br>outer Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and fixed&para;<br>structures erected thereon, which would be within the&para;<br>area of the State if its boundaries were extended seaward&para;<br>to the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf.” Section 1333(b), the provision involved in this case, makes&para;<br>LHWCA workers’ compensation benefits available for the&para;<br>“disability or death of an employee resulting from any&para;<br>injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on&para;<br>the outer Continental Shelf ” for the purpose of extracting&para;<br>its natural resources.&para;<br>The question before us is the scope of coverage under&para;<br>§1333(b). The parties agree that §1333(b) covers employees, such as oil rig and drilling platform workers, who&para;<br>are injured while working directly on the OCS to extract&para;<br>its natural resources. They disagree, however, whether&para;<br>employees who are involved in extraction operations but&para;<br>who are injured beyond the OCS are also covered under&para;<br>the OCSLA. This dispute focuses on the meaning of the&para;<br>phrase “any injury occurring as the result of operations&para;<br>conducted on the outer Continental Shelf” in §1333(b).&para;<br>The Courts of Appeals have offered competing interpretations. In Curtis v. Schlumberger Offshore Service, Inc.,&para;<br>849 F. 2d, at 811, the Third Circuit held that, because&para;<br>Congress intended LHWCA coverage to be expansive,&para;<br>§1333(b) extends to all injuries that would not have occurred “but for” operations on the OCS. The Third Circuit&para;<br>thus concluded that an employee who worked on a semisubmersible drill rig, but who was killed in a car accident&para;<br>on the way to the helicopter that was to fly him to that rig,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was eligible for §1333(b) benefits. Id., at 806, 811. As the&para;<br>Third Circuit summarized, “ ‘But for’ [Curtis’] travelling to&para;<br>[his drill rig] for the purpose of conducting ‘operations’&para;<br>within §1333(b), employee Curtis would not have sustained injuries in the automobile accident.” Id., at 811.&para;<br>In Mills v. Director, supra, the Fifth Circuit, sitting en&para;<br>banc, adopted a narrower interpretation of §1333(b). The&para;<br>court concluded that Congress intended to establish “a&para;<br>bright-line geographic boundary for §1333(b) coverage,”&para;<br>and held that §1333(b) extends coverage only to employees&para;<br>engaged in OCS extractive activities who “suffer injury or&para;<br>death on an OCS platform or the waters above the OCS.”&para;<br>Id., at 362. Applying its “situs-of-injury” test, the Fifth&para;<br>Circuit held that a welder who was injured on land during&para;<br>the construction of an offshore oil platform was not eligible&para;<br>for §1333(b) benefits. Id., at 357, 362.&para;<br>In the case below, the Ninth Circuit rejected the Fifth&para;<br>Circuit’s “situs-of-injury” requirement as unsupported by&para;<br>the text of §1333(b), and the Third Circuit’s “but for” test&para;<br>as too broad to be consistent with Congress’ intent. 604&para;<br>F. 3d, at 1137, 1139. Instead, the Ninth Circuit adopted a&para;<br>third interpretation of §1333(b), holding that a “claimant&para;<br>must establish a substantial nexus between the injury and&para;<br>extractive operations on the shelf” to be eligible for&para;<br>§1333(b) benefits. Id., at 1139. “To meet the standard,”&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit explained, “the claimant must show that&para;<br>the work performed directly furthers outer continental&para;<br>shelf operations and is in the regular course of such operations.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Solicitor General suggests yet a fourth interpretation of §1333(b).1 This interpretation would extend cover——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, United&para;<br>States Department of Labor, is a respondent in this case because the&para;<br>Director administers the OCSLA workers’ compensation scheme&para;<br>established by §1333(b).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>age to two categories of injuries: (1) all on-OCS injuries&para;<br>suffered by employees of companies engaged in resource&para;<br>extraction on the OCS; and (2) the off-OCS injuries of&para;<br>those employees who spend a substantial portion of their&para;<br>worktime on the OCS engaging in extractive operations.&para;<br>Brief for Federal Respondent 32–33. According to the&para;<br>Solicitor General, this test would provide §1333(b) coverage for off-OCS injuries only to those employees whose&para;<br>duties contribute to operations on the OCS and who perform work on the OCS itself that is substantial in both&para;<br>duration and nature. Id., at 35.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Pacific argues that the Fifth Circuit’s “situs-of-injury”&para;<br>test presents the best interpretation of §1333(b). The crux&para;<br>of Pacific’s argument is that off-OCS injuries cannot be&para;<br>“the result of operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf ” for purposes of §1333(b). Pacific asserts that&para;<br>because Valladolid was injured on dry land, his death did&para;<br>not occur as the result of extraction operations conducted&para;<br>on the OCS, and therefore respondent is ineligible for&para;<br>LHWCA workers’ compensation benefits. We disagree.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The OCSLA extends the provisions of the LHWCA to&para;<br>the “disability or death of an employee resulting from any&para;<br>injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on&para;<br>the outer Continental Shelf.” §1333(b). Contrary to the&para;<br>view of Pacific and the Fifth Circuit, nothing in that language suggests that the injury to the employee must occur&para;<br>on the OCS. Section 1333(b) states only two requirements: The extractive operations must be “conducted on&para;<br>the outer Continental Shelf,” and the employee’s injury&para;<br>must occur “as the result of ” those operations.&para;<br>Despite the lack of a textual “situs-of-injury” requirement in §1333(b), Pacific argues that it is logically impos-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sible for an off-OCS employee to be injured “as the result&para;<br>of ” on-OCS operations. Pacific offers no basis for this&para;<br>assertion, and we find none. Indeed, given that many&para;<br>OCS platforms are physically connected to onshore processing facilities via oil and gas pipelines, it is not difficult&para;<br>to imagine an accident occurring on an OCS platform that&para;<br>could injure employees located off the OCS.&para;<br>Moreover, if, as Pacific suggests, the purpose of §1333(b)&para;<br>was to geographically limit the extension of LHWCA&para;<br>coverage to injuries that occurred on the OCS, Congress&para;<br>could easily have achieved that goal by omitting the following six words in §1333(b)’s text: “as the result of operations conducted.” Had Congress done so, the statute&para;<br>would extend LHWCA coverage to the “disability or death&para;<br>of an employee resulting from any injury occurring on the&para;<br>outer Continental Shelf.” But that is not the text of the&para;<br>statute Congress enacted.&para;<br>Pacific also argues that, because all of §1333(b)’s neighboring subsections contain specific situs limitations, we&para;<br>should infer that Congress intended to include a situs-ofinjury requirement in §1333(b). See, e.g., §1333(a)(2)(A)&para;<br>(adopting the civil and criminal laws of the adjacent State&para;<br>as federal law “for that portion of the subsoil and seabed of&para;<br>the outer Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and&para;<br>fixed structures erected thereon, which would be within&para;<br>the area of the State if its boundaries were extended seaward to the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf ”).2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 See also 43 U.

Congress’ decision to specify, in scrupulous detail, exactly&para;<br>where the other subsections of §1333 apply, but to include&para;<br>no similar restriction on injuries in §1333(b), convinces us&para;<br>that Congress did not intend §1333(b) to apply only to&para;<br>injuries suffered on the OCS. Rather, §1333(b) extends&para;<br>LHWCA workers’ compensation coverage to any employee&para;<br>injury, regardless of where it happens, as long as it occurs&para;<br>“as the result of operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf.”&para;<br>Pacific argues that this conclusion is foreclosed by language in Herb’s Welding, Inc. v.

S.&para;<br>207 (1986); but neither of those cases held that §1333(b)&para;<br>extends only to injuries that occur on the OCS.

In any&para;<br>event, the ambiguous comment was made without analysis in dicta and does not control this case.&para;<br>The same is true of the Court’s opinion in Offshore&para;<br>Logistics. In that case, the Court considered whether the&para;<br>widows of oil platform workers who were killed when their&para;<br>helicopter crashed into the high seas could file wrongfuldeath suits under Louisiana law. In the Court’s analysis&para;<br>of §1333, it stated, “Congress determined that the general&para;<br>scope of OCSLA’s coverage . . . would be determined principally by locale, not by the status of the individual injured&para;<br>or killed.” 477 U. S., at 219–220 (citing the situs requirement in §1333(a)(2)(A)). In a footnote, the Court commented: “Only one provision of OCSLA superimposes a&para;<br>status requirement on the otherwise determinative&para;<br>OCSLA situs requirement; §1333(b) makes compensation&para;<br>for the death or injury of an ‘employee’ resulting from&para;<br>certain operations on the Outer Continental Shelf payable&para;<br>under the [LHWCA].” Ibid., n. 2. These comments about&para;<br>the scope of the OCSLA’s coverage and its determinative&para;<br>“situs requirement” do not provide definitive evidence that&para;<br>§1333(b) applies only to injuries that occur on the OCS.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>As in Herb’s Welding, it is unclear whether the statement&para;<br>in the Offshore Logistics footnote regarding §1333(b) was&para;<br>referring to the explicit situs-of-operations requirement or&para;<br>to an implicit situs-of-injury requirement. Moreover, the&para;<br>entire footnote is dictum because, as the Court explicitly&para;<br>stated, §1333(b) had no bearing on the case. 470 U. S., at&para;<br>219–220.&para;<br>Finally, Pacific argues that including off-OCS injuries&para;<br>within the scope of the workers’ compensation coverage&para;<br>created by §1333(b) runs counter to Congress’ intent in&para;<br>drafting the OCSLA. According to Pacific, Congress intended to create a uniform OCS compensation scheme that&para;<br>both filled the jurisdictional voids and eliminated jurisdictional overlaps between existing state and federal programs. Pacific points out that, without a situs-of-injury&para;<br>requirement to narrow the scope of §1333(b), an off-OCS&para;<br>worker could be eligible for both state and federal workers’&para;<br>compensation coverage.&para;<br>There is no indication in the text, however, that the&para;<br>OCSLA excludes OCS workers from LHWCA coverage&para;<br>when they are also eligible for state benefits. To the contrary, the LHWCA workers’ compensation scheme incorporated by the OCSLA explicitly anticipates that injured&para;<br>employees might be eligible for both state and federal&para;<br>benefits. An offsetting provision in the LHWCA provides&para;<br>that “any amounts paid to an employee for the same injury, disability, or death for which benefits are claimed&para;<br>under [the LHWCA] pursuant to any other workers’ compensation law or [the Jones Act] shall be credited against&para;<br>any liability imposed by [the LHWCA].” 33 U. S. C.&para;<br>§903(e). This provision, in addition to the lack of any&para;<br>textual support for Pacific’s argument, convinces us that&para;<br>Congress did not limit the scope of 43 U. S. C. §1333(b)’s&para;<br>coverage to only those geographic areas where state workers’ compensation schemes do not apply.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>Pacific also offers an alternative argument derived from&para;<br>the interaction of §1333(b) and a provision of the LHWCA.&para;<br>Specifically, Pacific argues that because the LHWCA&para;<br>contains an explicit situs-of-injury requirement, see 33&para;<br>U. S. C. §903(a) (providing benefits only for injuries occurring “upon the navigable waters” of the United States),&para;<br>and because 43 U. S. C. §1333(b) extends the LHWCA&para;<br>workers’ compensation scheme to the OCS, §1333(b) incorporates the strict LHWCA situs-of-injury requirement&para;<br>from §903(a). According to Pacific, the words “occurring as&para;<br>the result of operations” in §1333(b) impose a status requirement in addition to the imported LHWCA situs-ofinjury requirement, with the result that employees who&para;<br>are injured on the OCS, but whose jobs are not related to&para;<br>extractive operations, are excluded from the workers’&para;<br>compensation coverage created by §1333(b). Thus, an&para;<br>accountant who is injured on a field trip to the drilling&para;<br>platform would be ineligible under §1333(b) despite being&para;<br>an employee who is injured on the OCS.&para;<br>Although this alternative argument has the advantage&para;<br>of assigning some meaning to the words “occurring as the&para;<br>result of operations” in §1333(b), we still find it unpersuasive. First, it is unlikely that Congress intended to impose&para;<br>a situs-of-injury requirement in §1333(b) through such a&para;<br>nonintuitive and convoluted combination of two separate&para;<br>legislative Acts. As we have already noted, creating an&para;<br>express situs-of-injury requirement in the text of §1333(b)&para;<br>would have been simple. Second, combining the §1333(b)&para;<br>definition of “United States” with the LHWCA situs-ofinjury requirement in 33 U. S. C. §903(a) would result in&para;<br>an OCS workers’ compensation scheme that applies only&para;<br>to the seabed of the OCS and to any artificial islands and&para;<br>fixed structures thereon. See 43 U. S. C. §1333(b)(3)&para;<br>(stating that “the term ‘United States’ when used in a&para;<br>geographical sense includes the outer Continental Shelf&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and artificial islands and fixed structures thereon”).&para;<br>Pacific concedes that this scheme would exclude the navigable waters above the shelf, including the waters immediately adjacent to any drilling platforms. Consequently,&para;<br>under Pacific’s view, even employees on a crew ship immediately adjacent to an OCS platform who are injured&para;<br>during a platform explosion would be excluded from&para;<br>§1333(b) coverage. That view cannot be squared with the&para;<br>text of the statute, which applies to “any injury occurring&para;<br>as the result of operations conducted” on the OCS.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Pacific also makes several policy arguments in favor of&para;<br>a situs-of-injury requirement, but policy concerns cannot&para;<br>justify an interpretation of §1333(b) that is inconsistent&para;<br>with the text of the OCSLA. “[I]f Congress’ coverage&para;<br>decisions are mistaken as a matter of policy, it is for Congress to change them. We should not legislate for them.”&para;<br>Herb’s Welding, 470 U. S., at 427. The language of&para;<br>§1333(b) simply does not support a categorical exclusion&para;<br>of injuries that occur beyond the OCS.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The Solicitor General urges us to adopt a status-based&para;<br>inquiry that applies one test to on-OCS injuries and a&para;<br>different test to off-OCS injuries. Specifically, the Government proposes that when a worker is injured on the&para;<br>OCS, he is eligible for workers’ compensation benefits if he&para;<br>is employed by a company engaged in extractive operations on the OCS. But if the employee is injured off the&para;<br>OCS, the employee will be covered only if his “duties&para;<br>contribute to operations” on the OCS and if he performs&para;<br>“work on the [OCS] itself that is substantial in terms of&para;<br>both its duration and nature.” Brief for Federal Respondent 35. This approach is derived from our decision in&para;<br>Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347 (1995) (establishing&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>criteria by which an employee qualifies as a “seaman”&para;<br>under the Jones Act), and might well have merit as legislation. But it has no basis in the text of the OCSLA as&para;<br>presently enacted. The “occurring as the result of operations” language in §1333(b) plainly suggests causation.&para;<br>Although the Government asserts that a status-based test&para;<br>would be preferable to a causation-based test, we cannot&para;<br>ignore the language enacted by Congress.&para;<br>The Third Circuit’s “but for” test is nominally based on&para;<br>causation, but it is also incompatible with §1333(b). Taken to its logical conclusion, the “but for” test would extend&para;<br>workers’ compensation coverage to all employees of a&para;<br>business engaged in the extraction of natural resources&para;<br>from the OCS, no matter where those employees work or&para;<br>what they are doing when they are injured. This test&para;<br>could reasonably be interpreted to cover land-based office&para;<br>employees whose jobs have virtually nothing to do with&para;<br>extractive operations on the OCS. Because Congress extended LHWCA coverage only to injuries “occurring as&para;<br>the result of operations conducted on the outer Continental Shelf,” we think that §1333(b) should be interpreted in&para;<br>a manner that focuses on injuries that result from those&para;<br>“operations.” This view is consistent with our past treatment of similar language in other contexts. In Holmes v.&para;<br>Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258&para;<br>(1992), we considered a provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act that provided a&para;<br>cause of action to “[a]ny person injured in his business&para;<br>or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.” 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §1964(c) (emphasis added). We rejected a “but&para;<br>for” interpretation, stating that such a construction was&para;<br>“hardly compelled” and that it was highly unlikely that&para;<br>Congress intended to allow all factually injured plaintiffs&para;<br>to recover. 503 U. S., at 265–266. Instead, we adopted a&para;<br>proximate-cause standard consistent with our prior interpretation of the same language in the Sherman and Clay-&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>PACIFIC OPERATORS OFFSHORE, LLP v. VALLADOLID&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ton Acts. Id., at 267–268. Similarly, 43 U. S. C. §1333(b)’s&para;<br>language hardly compels the Third Circuit’s expansive&para;<br>“but for” interpretation.&para;<br>Accordingly, we conclude that the Ninth Circuit’s&para;<br>“substantial-nexus” test is more faithful to the text of&para;<br>§1333(b). We understand the Ninth Circuit’s test to require&para;<br>the injured employee to establish a significant causal link&para;<br>between the injury that he suffered and his employer’s onOCS operations conducted for the purpose of extracting&para;<br>natural resources from the OCS.&para;<br>Although the Ninth Circuit’s test may not be the easiest&para;<br>to administer, it best reflects the text of §1333(b), which&para;<br>establishes neither a situs-of-injury nor a “but for” test.&para;<br>We are confident that ALJs and courts will be able to&para;<br>determine whether an injured employee has established a&para;<br>significant causal link between the injury he suffered and&para;<br>his employer’s on-OCS extractive operations. Although we&para;<br>expect that employees injured while performing tasks on&para;<br>the OCS will regularly satisfy the test, whether an employee injured while performing an off-OCS task qualifies—like Valladolid, who died while tasked with onshore&para;<br>scrap metal consolidation—is a question that will depend&para;<br>on the individual circumstances of each case. The Ninth&para;<br>Circuit remanded the case for the Benefits Review Board&para;<br>to apply the “substantial-nexus” test in the first instance,&para;<br>and we agree with that disposition.&para;<br>The judgment is affirmed, and the case is remanded to&para;<br>the Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent&para;<br>with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

See, e.g., Ex parte Patton, __ So. 3d __, __&para;<br>(Ala. 2011); Marandino v. Prometheus Pharmacy, 294&para;<br>Conn. 564, 591, 986 A. 2d 1023, 1041 (2010); Grant v.&para;<br>Grant Textiles, 372 S.

That clarification—and any further clarification in&para;<br>the Commerce Clause context—will not be remotely helpful to lower courts attempting to apply the substantialnexus test in the very different legal context of workers’&para;<br>compensation under §1333(b). In this latter context, I&para;<br>assume the Court means by “substantial nexus” a substantial causal nexus—since §1333(b)’s “as the result of ”&para;<br>language “plainly suggests causation,” ante, at 13. Like&para;<br>the word “nexus” itself, the definition of “substantial&para;<br>nexus” in our state-tax cases does not require any causal&para;<br>relationship whatsoever. The proximate-cause test, by&para;<br>comparison, represents a much more natural interpretation of a statute that turns on causation.&para;<br>Does the Court mean to establish, by the novel “substantial [causal] nexus” test, a new tertium quid of causality—somewhere between but-for causality and proximate&para;<br>cause?
