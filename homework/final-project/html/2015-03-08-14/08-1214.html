INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1214. Argued January 19, 2010—Decided June 24, 2010&para;<br>In June 2004, respondent local union (Local), supported by its parent&para;<br>international (IBT), initiated a strike against petitioner Granite&para;<br>Rock, the employer of some of Local’s members, following the expira&para;<br>tion of the parties’ collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) and an im&para;<br>passe in their negotiations. On July 2, the parties agreed to a new&para;<br>CBA containing no-strike and arbitration clauses, but could not reach&para;<br>a separate back-to-work agreement holding local and international&para;<br>union members harmless for any strike-related damages Granite&para;<br>Rock incurred. IBT instructed Local to continue striking until Gran&para;<br>ite Rock approved such a hold-harmless agreement, but the company&para;<br>refused to do so, informing Local that continued strike activity would&para;<br>violate the new CBA’s no-strike clause. IBT and Local responded by&para;<br>announcing a company-wide strike involving numerous facilities and&para;<br>workers, including members of other IBT locals.&para;<br>Granite Rock sued IBT and Local, invoking federal jurisdiction&para;<br>under §301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA),&para;<br>seeking strike-related damages for the unions’ alleged breach of con&para;<br>tract, and asking for an injunction against the ongoing strike because&para;<br>the hold-harmless dispute was an arbitrable grievance under the new&para;<br>CBA. The unions conceded §301(a) jurisdiction, but asserted that the&para;<br>new CBA was never validly ratified by a vote of Local’s members,&para;<br>and, thus, the CBA’s no-strike clause did not provide a basis for&para;<br>Granite Rock to challenge the strike. After Granite Rock amended&para;<br>its complaint to add claims that IBT tortiously interfered with the&para;<br>new CBA, the unions moved to dismiss. The District Court granted&para;<br>IBT’s motion to dismiss the tortious interference claims on the&para;<br>ground that §301(a) supports a federal cause of action only for breach&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>of contract. But the court denied Local’s separate motion to send the&para;<br>parties’ dispute over the CBA’s ratification date to arbitration, ruling&para;<br>that a jury should decide whether ratification occurred on July 2, as&para;<br>Granite Rock contended, or on August 22, as Local alleged. After the&para;<br>jury concluded that the CBA was ratified on July 2, the court ordered&para;<br>arbitration to proceed on Granite Rock’s breach-of-contract claims.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the tortious interference&para;<br>claims, but reversed the arbitration order, holding that the parties’&para;<br>ratification-date dispute was a matter for an arbitrator to resolve un&para;<br>der the CBA’s arbitration clause. The Court of Appeals reasoned that&para;<br>the clause covered the ratification-date dispute because the clause&para;<br>clearly covered the related strike claims; national policy favoring ar&para;<br>bitration required ambiguity about the arbitration clause’s scope to&para;<br>be resolved in favor of arbitrability; and, in any event, Granite Rock&para;<br>had implicitly consented to arbitrate the ratification-date dispute by&para;<br>suing under the contract.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The parties’ dispute over the CBA’s ratification date was a mat&para;<br>ter for the District Court, not an arbitrator, to resolve. Pp. 6–20.&para;<br>(a) Whether parties have agreed to arbitrate a particular dispute&para;<br>is typically an “ ‘ issue for judicial determination,’ ” e.g., Howsam v.&para;<br>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 83, as is a dispute over an&para;<br>arbitration contract’s formation, see, e.g., First Options of Chicago,&para;<br>Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 944. These principles would neatly&para;<br>dispose of this case if the formation dispute here were typical. But it&para;<br>is not. It is based on when (not whether) the new CBA containing the&para;<br>parties’ arbitration clause was ratified and thereby formed. To de&para;<br>termine whether the parties’ dispute over the CBA’s ratification date&para;<br>is arbitrable, it is necessary to apply the rule that a court may order&para;<br>arbitration of a particular dispute only when satisfied that the par&para;<br>ties agreed to arbitrate that dispute. See, e.g., id., at 943. To satisfy&para;<br>itself that such agreement exists, the court must resolve any issue&para;<br>that calls into question the specific arbitration clause that a party&para;<br>seeks to have the court enforce. See, e.g., Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v.&para;<br>Jackson, ante, at 4–6. Absent an agreement committing them to an&para;<br>arbitrator, such issues typically concern the scope and enforceability&para;<br>of the parties’ arbitration clause. In addition, such issues always in&para;<br>clude whether the clause was agreed to, and may include when that&para;<br>agreement was formed. Pp. 6–7.&para;<br>(b) In cases invoking the “federal policy favoring arbitration of&para;<br>labor disputes,” Gateway Coal Co. v. Mine Workers, 414 U. S. 368,&para;<br>377, courts adhere to the same framework, see, e.g., AT&amp;T Technolo&para;<br>gies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, and discharge&para;<br>their duty to satisfy themselves that the parties agreed to arbitrate a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>particular dispute by (1) applying the presumption of arbitrability&para;<br>only where a validly formed and enforceable arbitration agreement is&para;<br>ambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at hand and (2) order&para;<br>ing arbitration only where the presumption is not rebutted, see, e.g.,&para;<br>id., at 651–652. Local is thus wrong to suggest that the presumption&para;<br>takes courts outside the settled framework for determining arbitra&para;<br>bility. This Court has never held that the presumption overrides the&para;<br>principle that a court may submit to arbitration “only those disputes&para;<br>. . . the parties have agreed to submit,” First Options, supra, at 943,&para;<br>nor that courts may use policy considerations as a substitute for&para;<br>party agreement, see, e.g., AT&amp;T Technologies, supra, at 648−651.&para;<br>The presumption should be applied only where it reflects, and derives&para;<br>its legitimacy from, a judicial conclusion (absent a provision validly&para;<br>committing the issue to an arbitrator) that arbitration of a particular&para;<br>dispute is what the parties intended because their express agreement&para;<br>to arbitrate was validly formed, is legally enforceable, and is best con&para;<br>strued to encompass the dispute. See, e.g., First Options, supra, at&para;<br>944–945. This simple framework compels reversal of the Ninth Cir&para;<br>cuit’s judgment because it requires judicial resolution of two related&para;<br>questions central to Local’s arbitration demand: when the CBA was&para;<br>formed, and whether its arbitration clause covers the matters Local&para;<br>wishes to arbitrate. Pp. 7–13.&para;<br>(c) The parties characterize their ratification-date dispute as a&para;<br>formation dispute because a union vote ratifying the CBA’s terms&para;<br>was necessary to form the contract. For purposes of determining ar&para;<br>bitrability, when a contract is formed can be as critical as whether it&para;<br>was formed. That is so where, as here, an agreement’s ratification&para;<br>date determines its formation date, and thus determines whether its&para;<br>provisions were enforceable during the period relevant to the parties’&para;<br>dispute. This formation date question requires judicial resolution&para;<br>here because it relates to Local’s arbitration demand in a way that&para;<br>required the District Court to determine the CBA’s ratification date&para;<br>in order to decide whether the parties consented to arbitrate the mat&para;<br>ters the demand covered. The CBA requires arbitration only of dis&para;<br>putes that “arise under” the agreement. The parties’ ratification-date&para;<br>dispute does not clearly fit that description. But the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>credited Local’s argument that the ratification-date dispute should be&para;<br>presumed arbitrable because it relates to a dispute (the no-strike dis&para;<br>pute) that does clearly “arise under” the CBA. The Ninth Circuit&para;<br>overlooked the fact that this theory of the ratification-date dispute’s&para;<br>arbitrability fails if, as Local asserts, the new CBA was not formed&para;<br>until August 22, because in that case there was no CBA for the July&para;<br>no-strike dispute to “arise under.” Local attempts to address this&para;<br>flaw in the Circuit’s reasoning by arguing that a December 2004&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>document the parties executed rendered the new CBA effective as of&para;<br>May 1, 2004, the date the prior CBA expired. The Court of Appeals&para;<br>did not rule on this claim, and this Court need not do so either be&para;<br>cause it was not raised in Local’s brief in opposition to the certiorari&para;<br>petition. Pp. 13–17.&para;<br>(d) Another reason to reverse the Court of Appeals’ judgment is&para;<br>that the ratification-date dispute, whether labeled a formation dis&para;<br>pute or not, falls outside the arbitration clause’s scope on grounds the&para;<br>presumption favoring arbitration cannot cure. CBA §20 provides, in&para;<br>ter alia, that “[a]ll disputes arising under this agreement shall be re&para;<br>solved in accordance with the [Grievance] procedure,” which includes&para;<br>arbitration. The parties’ ratification-date dispute cannot properly be&para;<br>said to fall within this provision’s scope for at least two reasons.&para;<br>First, the question whether the CBA was validly ratified on July 2,&para;<br>2004—a question concerning the CBA’s very existence—cannot fairly&para;<br>be said to “arise under” the CBA. Second, even if the “arising under”&para;<br>language could in isolation be construed to cover this dispute, §20’s&para;<br>remaining provisions all but foreclose such a reading by describing&para;<br>that section’s arbitration requirement as applicable to labor dis&para;<br>agreements that are addressed in the CBA and are subject to its re&para;<br>quirement of mandatory mediation. The Ninth Circuit’s contrary&para;<br>conclusion finds no support in §20’s text. That court’s only effort to&para;<br>grapple with that text misses the point by focusing on whether Gran&para;<br>ite Rock’s claim to enforce the CBA’s no-strike provisions could be&para;<br>characterized as “arising under” the agreement, which is not the dis&para;<br>positive issue here. Pp. 17–18.&para;<br>(e) Local’s remaining argument in support of the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals’ judgment—that Granite Rock “implicitly” consented to arbitra&para;<br>tion when it sued to enforce the CBA’s no-strike and arbitrable griev&para;<br>ance provisions—is similarly unavailing. Although it sought an&para;<br>injunction against the strike so the parties could arbitrate the labor&para;<br>grievance giving rise to it, Granite Rock’s decision to sue does not es&para;<br>tablish an agreement, “implicit” or otherwise, to arbitrate an issue&para;<br>(the CBA’s formation date) that the company did not raise and has&para;<br>always rightly characterized as beyond the arbitration clause’s scope.&para;<br>Pp. 19–20.&para;<br>2. The Ninth Circuit did not err in declining to recognize a new fed&para;<br>eral common-law cause of action under LMRA §301(a) for IBT’s al&para;<br>leged tortious interference with the CBA. Though virtually all other&para;<br>Circuits have rejected such claims, Granite Rock argues that doing so&para;<br>in this case is inconsistent with federal labor law’s goal of promoting&para;<br>industrial peace and economic stability through judicial enforcement&para;<br>of CBAs, and with this Court’s precedents holding that a federal&para;<br>common law of labor contracts is necessary to further this goal, see,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>e.g., Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 451. The&para;<br>company says the remedy it seeks is necessary because other poten&para;<br>tial avenues for deterrence and redress, such as state-law tort claims,&para;<br>unfair labor practices claims before the National Labor Relations&para;<br>Board (NLRB), and federal common-law breach-of-contract claims,&para;<br>are either unavailable or insufficient. But Granite Rock has not yet&para;<br>exhausted all of these avenues for relief, so this case does not provide&para;<br>an opportunity to judge their efficacy. Accordingly, it would be pre&para;<br>mature to recognize the cause of action Granite Rock seeks, even as&para;<br>suming §301(a) authorizes this Court to do so. That is particularly&para;<br>true here because the complained-of course of conduct has already&para;<br>prompted judgments favorable to Granite Rock from the jury below&para;<br>and from the NLRB in separate proceedings concerning the union’s&para;<br>attempts to delay the new CBA’s ratification. Those proceedings, and&para;<br>others to be conducted on remand, buttress the conclusion that Gran&para;<br>ite Rock’s assumptions about the adequacy of other avenues of relief&para;<br>are questionable, and that the Court of Appeals did not err in declin&para;<br>ing to recognize the new federal tort Granite Rock requests.

TEAMSTERS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>Petitioner Granite Rock Company is a concrete and&para;<br>building materials company that has operated in Califor&para;<br>nia since 1900. Granite Rock employs approximately 800&para;<br>employees under different labor contracts with several&para;<br>unions, including respondent International Brotherhood of&para;<br>Teamsters, Local 287 (Local). Granite Rock and Local&para;<br>were parties to a 1999 CBA that expired in April 2004.&para;<br>The parties’ attempt to negotiate a new CBA hit an im&para;<br>passe and, on June 9, 2004, Local members initiated a&para;<br>strike in support of their contract demands.1&para;<br>The strike continued until July 2, 2004, when the par&para;<br>ties reached agreement on the terms of a new CBA. The&para;<br>CBA contained a no-strike clause but did not directly&para;<br>address union members’ liability for any strike-related&para;<br>damages Granite Rock may have incurred before the new&para;<br>CBA was negotiated but after the prior CBA had expired.&para;<br>At the end of the negotiating session on the new CBA,&para;<br>Local’s business representative, George Netto, approached&para;<br>Granite Rock about executing a separate “back-to-work”&para;<br>agreement that would, among other things, hold union&para;<br>members harmless for damages incurred during the June&para;<br>2004 strike. Netto did not make execution of such an&para;<br>agreement a condition of Local’s ratification of the CBA, or&para;<br>of Local’s decision to cease picketing. Thus, Local did not&para;<br>have a back-to-work or hold-harmless agreement in place&para;<br>when it voted to ratify the CBA on July 2, 2004.&para;<br>Respondent International Brotherhood of Teamsters&para;<br>(IBT), which had advised Local throughout the CBA nego&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 In deciding the arbitration question in this case we rely upon the&para;<br>terms of the CBA and the facts in the District Court record.

In an effort to secure such an agreement, IBT in&para;<br>structed Local’s members not to honor their agreement to&para;<br>return to work on July 5, and instructed Local’s leaders to&para;<br>continue the work stoppage until Granite Rock agreed to&para;<br>hold Local and IBT members free from liability for the&para;<br>June strike. Netto demanded such an agreement on July&para;<br>6, but Granite Rock refused the request and informed&para;<br>Local that the company would view any continued strike&para;<br>activity as a violation of the new CBA’s no-strike clause.&para;<br>IBT and Local responded by announcing a company-wide&para;<br>strike that involved numerous facilities and hundreds of&para;<br>workers, including members of IBT locals besides Local&para;<br>287.&para;<br>According to Granite Rock, IBT not only instigated this&para;<br>strike; it supported and directed it. IBT provided pay and&para;<br>benefits to union members who refused to return to work,&para;<br>directed Local’s negotiations with Granite Rock, supported&para;<br>Local financially during the strike period with a $1.2&para;<br>million loan, and represented to Granite Rock that IBT&para;<br>had unilateral authority to end the work stoppage in&para;<br>exchange for a hold-harmless agreement covering IBT&para;<br>members within and outside Local’s bargaining unit.&para;<br>On July 9, 2004, Granite Rock sued IBT and Local in&para;<br>the District Court, seeking an injunction against the&para;<br>ongoing strike and strike-related damages. Granite Rock’s&para;<br>complaint, originally and as amended, invoked federal&para;<br>jurisdiction under LMRA §301(a), alleged that the July 6&para;<br>strike violated Local’s obligations under the CBA’s no&para;<br>strike provision, and asked the District Court to enjoin the&para;<br>strike because the hold-harmless dispute giving rise to the&para;<br>strike was an arbitrable grievance.

The unions conceded that LMRA §301(a)&para;<br>gave the District Court jurisdiction over the suit but op&para;<br>posed Granite Rock’s complaint, asserting that the CBA&para;<br>was not validly ratified on July 2 (or at any other time&para;<br>relevant to the July 2004 strike) and, thus, its no-strike&para;<br>clause did not provide a basis for Granite Rock’s claims&para;<br>challenging the strike.&para;<br>The District Court initially denied Granite Rock’s re&para;<br>quest to enforce the CBA’s no-strike provision because&para;<br>Granite Rock was unable to produce evidence that the&para;<br>CBA was ratified on July 2.

Shortly after&para;<br>the District Court ruled, however, a Local member testi&para;<br>fied that Netto had put the new CBA to a ratification vote&para;<br>on July 2, and that the voting Local members unani&para;<br>mously approved the agreement. Based on this statement&para;<br>and supporting testimony from 12 other employees, Gran&para;<br>ite Rock moved for a new trial on its injunction and dam&para;<br>ages claims.&para;<br>On August 22, while that motion was pending, Local&para;<br>conducted a second successful “ratification” vote on the&para;<br>CBA, and on September 13, the day the District Court was&para;<br>scheduled to hear Granite Rock’s motion, the unions called&para;<br>off their strike. Although their return to work mooted&para;<br>Granite Rock’s request for an injunction, the District&para;<br>Court proceeded with the hearing and granted Granite&para;<br>Rock a new trial on its damages claims.

The Court of Appeals reasoned that the parties’&para;<br>dispute over this issue was governed by the CBA’s arbitra&para;<br>tion clause because the clause clearly covered the related&para;<br>strike claims, the “national policy favoring arbitration”&para;<br>required that any ambiguity about the scope of the parties’&para;<br>arbitration clause be resolved in favor of arbitrability, and,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The CBA’s ratification date is important to Granite Rock’s underly&para;<br>ing suit for strike damages.

The first principle is that where,&para;<br>as here, parties concede that they have agreed to arbitrate&para;<br>some matters pursuant to an arbitration clause, the “law’s&para;<br>permissive policies in respect to arbitration” counsel that&para;<br>“ ‘ any doubts concerning the scope of arbitral issues should&para;<br>be resolved in favor of arbitration.’ ” First Options, supra,&para;<br>at 945 (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v.

Although Warrior &amp; Gulf contains language that might in&para;<br>isolation be misconstrued as establishing a presumption that labor&para;<br>disputes are arbitrable whenever they are not expressly excluded from&para;<br>an arbitration clause, 363 U.

The pre&para;<br>sumption simply assists in resolving arbitrability disputes&para;<br>within that framework. Confining the presumption to this&para;<br>role reflects its foundation in “the federal policy favoring&para;<br>arbitration.” As we have explained, this “policy” is merely&para;<br>an acknowledgment of the FAA’s commitment to “overrule&para;<br>the judiciary’s longstanding refusal to enforce agreements&para;<br>to arbitrate and to place such agreements upon the same&para;<br>footing as other contracts.” Volt, 489 U. S., at 478 (inter&para;<br>nal quotation marks and citations omitted). Accordingly,&para;<br>we have never held that this policy overrides the principle&para;<br>that a court may submit to arbitration “only those dis&para;<br>putes . . . that the parties have agreed to submit.” First&para;<br>Options, 514 U.

Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 444, n.1 (2006), which&para;<br>concerned whether, not when, an agreement to arbitrate was “con&para;<br>cluded.” That said, the manner in which the CBA’s ratification date&para;<br>relates to Local’s arbitration demand makes the ratification-date&para;<br>dispute in this case one that requires judicial resolution.

TEAMSTERS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>trability, when a contract is formed can be as critical as&para;<br>whether it was formed. That is the case where, as here,&para;<br>the date on which an agreement was ratified determines&para;<br>the date the agreement was formed, and thus determines&para;<br>whether the agreement’s provisions were enforceable&para;<br>during the period relevant to the parties’ dispute.10&para;<br>This formation date question requires judicial resolution&para;<br>here because it relates to Local’s arbitration demand in&para;<br>such a way that the District Court was required to decide&para;<br>the CBA’s ratification date in order to determine whether&para;<br>the parties consented to arbitrate the matters covered by&para;<br>the demand.11 The parties agree that the CBA’s arbitra&para;<br>tion clause pertains only to disputes that “arise under” the&para;<br>agreement. Accordingly, to hold the parties’ ratification&para;<br>date dispute arbitrable, the Court of Appeals had to decide&para;<br>whether that dispute could be characterized as “arising&para;<br>under” the CBA. In answering this question in the af&para;<br>firmative, both Local and the Court of Appeals tied the&para;<br>arbitrability of the ratification-date issue—which Local&para;<br>raised as a defense to Granite Rock’s strike claims—to the&para;<br>arbitrability of the strike claims themselves.

We recognize that ratification disputes in labor cases may&para;<br>often qualify as “formation disputes” for contract law purposes because&para;<br>contract law defines formation as acceptance of an offer on specified&para;<br>terms, and in many labor cases ratification of a CBA is necessary to&para;<br>satisfy this formation requirement. See App. 349−351. But it is not the&para;<br>mere labeling of a dispute for contract law purposes that determines&para;<br>whether an issue is arbitrable.

The&para;<br>unions began their strike on July 6, 2004, and Granite&para;<br>Rock filed its suit on July 9. If, as Local asserts, the CBA&para;<br>containing the parties’ arbitration clause was not ratified,&para;<br>and thus not formed, until August 22, there was no CBA&para;<br>for the July no-strike dispute to “arise under,” and thus no&para;<br>valid basis for the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that Gran&para;<br>ite Rock’s July 9 claims arose under the CBA and were&para;<br>thus arbitrable along with, by extension, Local’s formation&para;<br>date defense to those claims.12 See ibid. For the foregoing&para;<br>reasons, resolution of the parties’ dispute about whether&para;<br>the CBA was ratified in July or August was central to&para;<br>deciding Local’s arbitration demand.

Section 20 of the CBA provides in relevant&para;<br>part that “[a]ll disputes arising under this agreement shall&para;<br>be resolved in accordance with the [Grievance] procedure,”&para;<br>which includes arbitration. App. 434 (emphasis added);&para;<br>see also id., at 434–437. The parties’ ratification-date&para;<br>dispute cannot properly be characterized as falling within&para;<br>the (relatively narrow, cf., e.g., Drake Bakeries Inc., 370&para;<br>U. S., at 256–257) scope of this provision for at least two&para;<br>reasons. First, we do not think the question whether the&para;<br>CBA was validly ratified on July 2, 2004—a question that&para;<br>concerns the CBA’s very existence—can fairly be said to&para;<br>“arise under” the CBA. Second, even if the “arising under”&para;<br>language could in isolation be construed to cover this&para;<br>dispute, Section 20’s remaining provisions all but foreclose&para;<br>such a reading by describing that section’s arbitration&para;<br>requirement as applicable to labor disagreements that are&para;<br>addressed in the CBA and are subject to its requirement of&para;<br>mandatory mediation. See App. 434–437 (requiring arbi&para;<br>tration of disputes “arising under” the CBA, but only after&para;<br>the Union and Employer have exhausted mandatory&para;<br>mediation, and limiting any arbitration decision under&para;<br>this provision to those “within the scope and terms of&para;<br>this agreement and . . . specifically limited to the matter&para;<br>submitted”).&para;<br>——————&para;<br>a party’s noncompliance with it would require this Court to decide, in&para;<br>the first instance, a question whose resolution could affect this and&para;<br>other cases in a manner that the District Court and Court of Appeals&para;<br>did not have an opportunity to consider, and that the parties’ argu&para;<br>ments before this Court may not fully address.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The Court of Appeals’ contrary conclusion does not find&para;<br>support in the text of §20. The Court of Appeals’ only&para;<br>effort to grapple with that text misses the point because it&para;<br>focuses on whether Granite Rock’s claim to enforce the&para;<br>CBA’s no-strike provisions could be characterized as “aris&para;<br>ing under” the agreement. See 546 F. 3d, at 1177, n. 4.&para;<br>Even assuming that claim can be characterized as “arising&para;<br>under” the CBA, it is not the issue here. The issue is&para;<br>whether the formation-date defense that Local raised in&para;<br>response to Granite Rock’s no-strike suit can be character&para;<br>ized as “arising under” the CBA. It cannot for the reasons&para;<br>we have explained, namely, the CBA provision requiring&para;<br>arbitration of disputes “arising under” the CBA is not&para;<br>fairly read to include a dispute about when the CBA came&para;<br>into existence. The Court of Appeals erred in failing to&para;<br>address this question and holding instead that the arbitra&para;<br>tion clause is “susceptible of an interpretation” that covers&para;<br>Local’s formation-date defense to Granite Rock’s suit&para;<br>“[b]ecause Granite Rock is suing ‘under’ the alleged new&para;<br>CBA” and “[a]rbitration clauses are to be construed very&para;<br>broadly.” Ibid.; see also id., at 1178.&para;<br>D&para;<br>Local’s remaining argument in support of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals’ judgment is similarly unavailing. Local reiter&para;<br>ates the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that Granite Rock&para;<br>“implicitly” consented to arbitration when it sued to en&para;<br>force the CBA’s no-strike and arbitrable grievance provi&para;<br>sions. See Brief for Respondent Local, pp. 17–18. We do&para;<br>not agree that by seeking an injunction against the strike&para;<br>so the parties could arbitrate the labor grievance that gave&para;<br>rise to it, Granite Rock also consented to arbitrate the&para;<br>ratification (formation) date dispute we address above.&para;<br>See 564 F. 3d, at 1178. It is of course true that when&para;<br>Granite Rock sought that injunction it viewed the CBA&para;<br>(and all of its provisions) as enforceable. But Granite&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

The mere fact that&para;<br>Local raised the formation date dispute as a defense to&para;<br>Granite Rock’s suit does not make that dispute attribut&para;<br>able to Granite Rock in the waiver or estoppel sense the&para;<br>Court of Appeals suggested, see 546 F. 3d, at 1178, much&para;<br>less establish that Granite Rock agreed to arbitrate it by&para;<br>suing to enforce the CBA as to other matters. Accordingly,&para;<br>we hold that the parties’ dispute over the CBA’s formation&para;<br>date was for the District Court, not an arbitrator, to re&para;<br>solve, and remand for proceedings consistent with that&para;<br>conclusion.&para;<br>III&para;<br>We turn now to the claims available on remand. The&para;<br>parties agree that Granite Rock can bring a breach-of&para;<br>contract claim under LMRA §301(a) against Local as a&para;<br>CBA signatory, and against IBT as Local’s agent or alter&para;<br>ego.

Compare&para;<br>Brief for Respondent IBT, p. 10 with Reply Brief for Petitioner 12–13,&para;<br>n. 11. Granite Rock concedes that it has abandoned its claim that IBT&para;<br>acted as Local’s undisclosed principal in orchestrating the ratification&para;<br>response to the July 2, 2004, CBA.

The Court of Appeals joined virtu&para;<br>ally all other Circuits in holding that it would not recog&para;<br>nize such a claim under §301(a).&para;<br>Granite Rock asks us to reject this position as inconsis&para;<br>tent with federal labor law’s goal of promoting industrial&para;<br>peace and economic stability through judicial enforcement&para;<br>of CBAs, as well as with our precedents holding that a&para;<br>federal common law of labor contracts is necessary to&para;<br>further this goal. See id., at 31; see also, e.g., Textile&para;<br>Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 451 (1957).&para;<br>Explaining that IBT’s conduct in this case undermines the&para;<br>very core of the bargaining relationship federal labor laws&para;<br>exist to protect, Granite Rock argues that a federal&para;<br>common-law tort remedy for IBT’s conduct is necessary&para;<br>because other potential avenues for deterring and redress&para;<br>ing such conduct are either unavailable or insufficient.&para;<br>See Brief for Petitioner 32–33; Reply Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>19–20. On the unavailable side of the ledger Granite Rock&para;<br>lists state-law tort claims, some of which this Court has&para;<br>held §301(a) pre-empts, as well as administrative (unfair&para;<br>labor practices) claims, which Granite Rock says the Na&para;<br>tional Labor Relations Board (NLRB) cannot entertain&para;<br>——————&para;<br>unauthorized strike activity in July 2004. Nothing in the record before&para;<br>us unequivocally refutes this assertion. See App. 306, 311–315, 318;&para;<br>Points and Authorities 6, n. 3. Accordingly, nothing in this opinion&para;<br>forecloses the parties from litigating these claims on remand.&para;<br>16 IBT argues that we should dismiss this question as improvidently&para;<br>granted because Granite Rock abandoned its tortious interference claim&para;<br>when it declared its intention to seek only contractual (as opposed to&para;<br>punitive) damages on the claim. See Brief for Respondent IBT 16. We&para;<br>reject this argument, which confuses Granite Rock’s decision to forgo&para;<br>the pursuit of punitive damages on its claim with a decision to abandon&para;<br>the claim itself. The two are not synonymous, and IBT cites no author&para;<br>ity for the proposition that Granite Rock must allege more than eco&para;<br>nomic damages to state a claim on which relief could be granted.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>against international unions that (like IBT) are not part of&para;<br>the certified local bargaining unit they allegedly control.&para;<br>On the insufficient side of the ledger Granite Rock lists&para;<br>federal common-law breach-of-contract claims, which&para;<br>Granite Rock says are difficult to prove against non-CBA&para;<br>signatories like IBT because international unions struc&para;<br>ture their relationships with local unions in a way that&para;<br>makes agency or alter ego difficult to establish. Based on&para;<br>these assessments, Granite Rock suggests that this case&para;<br>presents us with the choice of either recognizing the fed&para;<br>eral common-law tort claim Granite Rock seeks or sanc&para;<br>tioning conduct inconsistent with federal labor statutes&para;<br>and our own precedents. See Brief for Petitioner 13–14.&para;<br>We do not believe the choice is as stark as Granite Rock&para;<br>implies. It is of course true that we have construed “Sec&para;<br>tion 301 [to] authoriz[e] federal courts to fashion a body of&para;<br>federal law for the enforcement of collective bargaining&para;<br>agreements.” Lewis v. Benedict Coal Corp., 361 U. S. 459,&para;<br>470 (1960) (citing Lincoln Mills, supra). But we have also&para;<br>emphasized that in developing this common law we “did&para;<br>not envision any freewheeling inquiry into what the fed&para;<br>eral courts might find to be the most desirable rule.”&para;<br>Howard Johnson Co. v. Hotel Employees, 417 U. S. 249,&para;<br>255 (1974). The balance federal statutes strike between&para;<br>employer and union relations in the collective-bargaining&para;<br>arena is carefully calibrated, see, e.g., NLRB v. Drivers,&para;<br>362 U. S. 274, 289–290 (1960), and as the parties’ briefs&para;<br>illustrate, creating a federal common-law tort cause of&para;<br>action would require a host of policy choices that could&para;<br>easily upset this balance, see Brief for Respondent IBT&para;<br>42–44; Reply Brief for Petitioner 22–25. It is thus no&para;<br>surprise that virtually all Courts of Appeals have held&para;<br>that federal courts’ authority to “create a federal common&para;<br>law of collective bargaining agreements under section 301”&para;<br>should be confined to “a common law of contracts, not a&para;<br>source of independent rights, let alone tort rights; for&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>section 301 is . . . a grant of jurisdiction only to enforce&para;<br>contracts.” Brazinski v. Amoco Petroleum Additives Co., 6&para;<br>F. 3d 1176, 1180 (CA7 1993). We see no reason for a&para;<br>different result here because it would be premature to&para;<br>recognize the federal common law tort Granite Rock re&para;<br>quests in this case even assuming that §301(a) authorizes&para;<br>us to do so.&para;<br>In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize that the&para;<br>question before us is a narrow one. It is not whether the&para;<br>conduct Granite Rock challenges is remediable, but&para;<br>whether we should augment the claims already available&para;<br>to Granite Rock by creating a new federal common-law&para;<br>cause of action under §301(a). That we decline to do so&para;<br>does not mean that we approve of IBT’s alleged actions.&para;<br>Granite Rock describes a course of conduct that does&para;<br>indeed seem to strike at the heart of the collective&para;<br>bargaining process federal labor laws were designed to&para;<br>protect. As the record in this case demonstrates, however,&para;<br>a new federal tort claim is not the only possible remedy for&para;<br>this conduct. Granite Rock’s allegations have prompted&para;<br>favorable judgments not only from a federal jury, but also&para;<br>from the NLRB. In proceedings that predated those in&para;<br>which the District Court entered judgment for Granite&para;<br>Rock on the CBA’s formation date,17 the NLRB concluded&para;<br>that a “complete agreement” was reached on July 2, and&para;<br>that Local and IBT violated federal labor laws by attempt&para;<br>ing to delay the CBA’s ratification pending execution of a&para;<br>separate agreement favorable to IBT.

See Brief for&para;<br>Respondent IBT 33–34; Reply Brief for Petitioner 16. But&para;<br>Granite Rock did not litigate below, and thus does not&para;<br>present us with occasion to address, whether state law&para;<br>might provide a remedy. See, e.g., Steelworkers v.

Nor did Granite&para;<br>Rock fully explore the breach-of-contract and administra&para;<br>tive causes of action it suggests are insufficient to remedy&para;<br>IBT’s conduct. For example, far from establishing that an&para;<br>agency or alter ego claim against IBT would be unsuccess&para;<br>ful, the record in this case suggests it might be easier to&para;<br>prove than usual if, as the NLRB’s decision observes, IBT&para;<br>and Local were affiliated in 2004 in a way relevant to&para;<br>Granite Rock’s claims. See In re Teamsters Local 287,&para;<br>supra, at 340, n. 6. Similarly, neither party has estab&para;<br>lished that the Board itself could not issue additional&para;<br>relief against IBT. IBT’s amici argue that the “overlap&para;<br>between Granite Rock’s §301 claim against the IBT and&para;<br>the NLRB General Counsel’s unfair labor practice com&para;<br>plaint against Local 287 brings into play the National&para;<br>Labor Relations Act rule that an international union&para;<br>commits an unfair labor practice by causing its affiliated&para;<br>local unions to ‘impose extraneous non-bargaining unit&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>GRANITE ROCK CO. v.

I respectfully dissent, however, from the Court’s&para;<br>conclusion that the arbitration provision in the collective&para;<br>bargaining agreement (CBA) between Granite Rock and&para;<br>IBT Local 287 does not cover the parties’ dispute over&para;<br>whether Local 287 breached the CBA’s no-strike clause.&para;<br>In my judgment, the parties clearly agreed in the CBA to&para;<br>have this dispute resolved by an arbitrator, not a court.&para;<br>The legal principles that govern this case are simpler&para;<br>than the Court’s exposition suggests. Arbitration, all&para;<br>agree, “is a matter of contract and a party cannot be re&para;<br>quired to submit to arbitration any dispute which [it] has&para;<br>not agreed so to submit.” Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf&para;<br>Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574, 582 (1960).

As the majority correctly observes, ante, at 7, n. 5, this case&para;<br>does not implicate the reversed presumption because both parties&para;<br>accept that a court, not an arbitrator, should resolve their current&para;<br>disagreement about whether their underlying dispute is arbitrable.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Local 287 contests this claim. Specifically, it con&para;<br>tends that it had no duty to abide by the no-strike clause&para;<br>in July because it did not vote to ratify the CBA until&para;<br>August. As I see it, the parties’ disagreement as to&para;<br>whether the no-strike clause proscribed the July work&para;<br>stoppage is plainly a “disput[e] arising under” the CBA&para;<br>and is therefore subject to arbitration as Local 287 de&para;<br>mands. Indeed, the parties’ no-strike dispute is indistin&para;<br>guishable from myriad other disputes that an employer&para;<br>and union might have concerning the interpretation and&para;<br>application of the substantive provisions of a collective&para;<br>bargaining agreement. These are precisely the sorts of&para;<br>controversies that labor arbitrators are called upon to&para;<br>resolve every day.&para;<br>The majority seems to agree that the CBA’s arbitration&para;<br>provision generally encompasses disputes between Gran&para;<br>ite Rock and Local 287 regarding the parties’ compliance&para;<br>with the terms of the CBA, including the no-strike clause.&para;<br>The majority contends, however, that Local 287’s “forma&para;<br>tion-date defense” raises a preliminary question of con&para;<br>tract formation that must be resolved by a court rather&para;<br>than an arbitrator. Ante, at 15. The majority’s reasoning&para;<br>appears to be the following: If Local 287 did not ratify the&para;<br>CBA until August, then there is “no valid basis” for apply&para;<br>ing the CBA’s arbitration provision to events that occurred&para;<br>in July. Ibid.&para;<br>The majority’s position is flatly inconsistent with the&para;<br>language of the CBA. The parties expressly chose to make&para;<br>the agreement effective from May 1, 2004. As a result,&para;<br>“the date on which [the] agreement was ratified” does not,&para;<br>as the majority contends, determine whether the parties’&para;<br>dispute about the permissibility of the July work stoppage&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>falls within the scope of the CBA’s arbitration provision.&para;<br>Ante, at 14. When it comes to answering the arbitrability&para;<br>question, it is entirely irrelevant whether Local 287 rati&para;<br>fied the CBA in August (as it contends) or in July (as&para;<br>Granite Rock contends). In either case, the parties’ dis&para;<br>pute—which postdates May 1—clearly “aris[es] under” the&para;<br>CBA, which is all the arbitration provision requires to&para;<br>make a dispute referable to an arbitrator. Cf. Litton&para;<br>Financial Printing Div., Litton Business Systems, Inc. v.&para;<br>NLRB, 501 U. S. 190, 201 (1991) (recognizing that “a&para;<br>collective-bargaining agreement might be drafted so as to&para;<br>eliminate any hiatus between expiration of the old and&para;<br>execution of the new agreement”).2&para;<br>Given the CBA’s express retroactivity, the majority errs&para;<br>in treating Local 287’s ratification-date defense as a “for&para;<br>mation dispute” subject to judicial resolution. Ante, at 13.&para;<br>The defense simply goes to the merits of Granite Rock’s&para;<br>claim: Local 287 maintains that the no-strike clause&para;<br>should not be construed to apply to the July work stoppage&para;<br>because it had not ratified the CBA at the time of that&para;<br>action. Cf. First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514&para;<br>U. S. 938, 942 (1995) (distinguishing a disagreement that&para;<br>“makes up the merits of the dispute” from a disagreement&para;<br>“about the arbitrability of the dispute”). Accordingly, the&para;<br>defense is necessarily a matter for the arbitrator, not the&para;<br>court. See AT&amp;T, 475 U. S., at 651 (“[I]t is for the arbitra&para;<br>tor to determine the relative merits of the parties’ sub&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Notably, at the time they executed the CBA in December 2004, the&para;<br>parties were well aware that they disagreed about the legitimacy of the&para;<br>July work stoppage. Yet they made the CBA retroactive to May and&para;<br>declined to carve out their no-strike dispute from the arbitration&para;<br>provision, despite expressly excluding three other classes of disputes&para;<br>from arbitration. Cf. Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co., 363&para;<br>U. S. 574, 584–585 (1960) (“In the absence of any express provision&para;<br>excluding a particular grievance from arbitration, we think only the&para;<br>most forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitra&para;<br>tion can prevail”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Indeed, this&para;<br>Court has been emphatic that “courts . . . have no business&para;<br>weighing the merits of the grievance.” Steelworkers v.&para;<br>American Mfg. Co., 363 U. S. 564, 568 (1960). “When the&para;<br>judiciary undertakes to determine the merits of a griev&para;<br>ance under the guise of interpreting the [arbitration provi&para;<br>sions] of collective bargaining agreements, it usurps a&para;<br>function . . . entrusted to the arbitration tribunal.” Id., at&para;<br>569; see also AT&amp;T, 475 U. S., at 649 (“[I]n deciding&para;<br>whether the parties have agreed to submit a particular&para;<br>grievance to arbitration, a court is not to rule on the po&para;<br>tential merits of the underlying claims”); Warrior, 363&para;<br>U. S., at 582, 585 (“[T]he judicial inquiry under [LMRA]&para;<br>§301 must be strictly confined to the question whether the&para;<br>reluctant party did agree to arbitrate the grievance”; “the&para;<br>court should view with suspicion an attempt to persuade it&para;<br>to become entangled in the construction of the substantive&para;<br>provisions of a labor agreement”).&para;<br>Attempting to sidestep this analysis, the majority de&para;<br>clares that Local 287 waived its retroactivity argument by&para;<br>failing in the courts below to challenge Granite Rock’s&para;<br>consistent characterization of the parties’ dispute as one of&para;<br>contract formation. See ante, at 16. As a result of Local&para;<br>287’s omission, the District Court and Court of Appeals&para;<br>proceeded under the understanding that this case pre&para;<br>sented a formation question. It was not until its merits&para;<br>brief in this Court that Local 287 attempted to correct this&para;<br>mistaken premise by pointing to the parties’ execution of&para;<br>the December 2004 CBA with its May 2004 effective date.&para;<br>This Court’s rules “admonis[h] [counsel] that they have an&para;<br>obligation to the Court to point out in the brief in opposi&para;<br>tion [to certiorari], and not later, any perceived misstate&para;<br>ment made in the petition [for certiorari]”; nonjurisdic&para;<br>tional arguments not raised at that time “may be deemed&para;<br>waived.” This Court’s Rule 15.2. Although it is regretta&para;<br>ble and inexcusable that Local 287 did not present its&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>GRANITE ROCK CO. v. TEAMSTERS&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>argument earlier, I do not see it as one we can ignore. The&para;<br>question presented in this case presupposes that “it is&para;<br>disputed whether any binding contract exists.” Brief for&para;<br>Petitioner i. Because it is instead undisputed that the&para;<br>parties executed a binding contract in December 2004 that&para;<br>was effective as of May 2004, we can scarcely pretend that&para;<br>the parties have a formation dispute. Consideration of&para;<br>this fact is “a ‘predicate to an intelligent resolution’ of the&para;<br>question presented, and therefore ‘fairly included&para;<br>therein.’ ” Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 38 (1996) (quot&para;<br>ing Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U. S. 252, 258, n. 5 (1980); this&para;<br>Court’s Rule 14.1(a)). Indeed, by declining to consider the&para;<br>plain terms of the parties’ agreement, the majority offers&para;<br>little more than “an opinion advising what the law would&para;<br>be upon a hypothetical state of facts.” Aetna Life Ins. Co.&para;<br>v. Haworth, 300 U. S. 227, 241 (1937). In view of the&para;<br>CBA’s effective date, I would hold that the parties agreed&para;<br>to arbitrate the no-strike dispute, including Local 287’s&para;<br>ratification-date defense, and I would affirm the judgment&para;<br>below on this alternative ground. Cf. Dandridge v. Wil&para;<br>liams, 397 U. S. 471, 475, n. 6 (1970) (“The prevailing&para;<br>party may, of course, assert in a reviewing court any&para;<br>ground in support of [the] judgment, whether or not that&para;<br>ground was relied upon or even considered by the trial&para;<br>court”).&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
