POWELL&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA&para;<br>No. 08–1175. Argued December 7, 2009—Decided February 23, 2010&para;<br>In a pathmarking decision, Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 471, this&para;<br>Court held that an individual must be “clearly informed,” prior to&para;<br>custodial questioning, that he has, among other rights, “the right to&para;<br>consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during inter&para;<br>rogation.”&para;<br>After arresting respondent Powell, but before questioning him,&para;<br>Tampa Police read him their standard Miranda form, stating, inter&para;<br>alia: “You have the right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of&para;<br>our questions” and “[y]ou have the right to use any of these rights at&para;<br>any time you want during this interview.” Powell then admitted he&para;<br>owned a handgun found in a police search. He was charged with pos&para;<br>session of a weapon by a convicted felon in violation of Florida law.&para;<br>The trial court denied Powell’s motion to suppress his inculpatory&para;<br>statements, which was based on the contention that the Miranda&para;<br>warnings he received did not adequately convey his right to the pres&para;<br>ence of an attorney during questioning. Powell was convicted of the&para;<br>gun-possession charge, but the intermediate appellate court held that&para;<br>the trial court should have suppressed the statements. The Florida&para;<br>Supreme Court agreed. It noted that both Miranda and the State&para;<br>Constitution require that a suspect be clearly informed of the right to&para;<br>have a lawyer present during questioning. The advice Powell re&para;<br>ceived was misleading, the court believed, because it suggested that&para;<br>he could consult with an attorney only before the police started to&para;<br>question him and did not convey his entitlement to counsel’s presence&para;<br>throughout the interrogation.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. This Court has jurisdiction to hear this case. Powell contends&para;<br>that jurisdiction is lacking because the Florida Supreme Court relied&para;<br>on the State’s Constitution as well as Miranda, hence the decision&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. POWELL&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>rested on an adequate and independent state ground. See Coleman&para;<br>v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729. Under Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S.&para;<br>1032, 1040–1041, however, when a state court decision fairly appears&para;<br>to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with federal law,&para;<br>and the adequacy and independence of any possible state-law ground&para;<br>is not clear from the face of its opinion, this Court presumes that fed&para;<br>eral law controlled the state court’s decision. Although invoking Flor&para;<br>ida’s Constitution and precedent in addition to this Court’s decisions,&para;<br>the Florida court did not expressly assert that state-law sources gave&para;<br>Powell rights distinct from, or broader than, those delineated in&para;<br>Miranda. See Long, 463 U. S., at 1044. The state-court opinion con&para;<br>sistently trained on what Miranda demands, rather than on what&para;<br>Florida law independently requires. This Court therefore cannot&para;<br>identify, “from the face of the opinion,” a clear statement that the de&para;<br>cision rested on a state ground separate from Miranda. See Long,&para;<br>463 U. S., at 1041. Because the opinion does not “indicat[e] clearly&para;<br>and expressly that it is alternatively based on bona fide separate,&para;<br>adequate, and independent [state] grounds,” Long, 463 U. S., at 1041,&para;<br>this Court has jurisdiction. Pp. 4–7.&para;<br>2. Advice that a suspect has “the right to talk to a lawyer before&para;<br>answering any of [the law enforcement officers’] questions,” and that&para;<br>he can invoke this right “at any time . . . during th[e] interview,” sat&para;<br>isfies Miranda. Pp. 7–13.&para;<br>(a) Miranda requires that a suspect “be warned prior to any&para;<br>questioning . . . that he has the right to the presence of an attorney.”&para;<br>384 U. S., at 479. This Miranda warning addresses the Court’s par&para;<br>ticular concern that “[t]he circumstances surrounding in-custody in&para;<br>terrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one&para;<br>merely made aware of his privilege [to remain silent] by his interro&para;<br>gators.” Id., at 469. Responsive to that concern, the Court stated, as&para;<br>“an absolute prerequisite to interrogation,” that an individual held&para;<br>for questioning “must be clearly informed that he has the right to&para;<br>consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during inter&para;<br>rogation.” Id., at 471. While the warnings prescribed by Miranda&para;<br>are invariable, this Court has not dictated the words in which the es&para;<br>sential information must be conveyed. See, e.g., California v. Pry&para;<br>sock, 453 U. S. 355, 359. In determining whether police warnings&para;<br>were satisfactory, reviewing courts are not required to “examine&para;<br>[them] as if construing a will or defining the terms of an easement.&para;<br>The inquiry is simply whether the warnings reasonably ‘conve[y] to&para;<br>[a suspect] his rights as required by Miranda.’ ” Duckworth v.&para;<br>Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 203. Pp. 7–9.&para;<br>(b) The warnings Powell received satisfy this standard. By in&para;<br>forming Powell that he had “the right to talk to a lawyer before an&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>swering any of [their] questions,” the Tampa officers communicated&para;<br>that he could consult with a lawyer before answering any particular&para;<br>question. And the statement that Powell had “the right to use any of&para;<br>[his] rights at any time [he] want[ed] during th[e] interview” con&para;<br>firmed that he could exercise his right to an attorney while the inter&para;<br>rogation was underway. In combination, the two warnings reasona&para;<br>bly conveyed the right to have an attorney present, not only at the&para;<br>outset of interrogation, but at all times. To reach the opposite con&para;<br>clusion, i.e., that the attorney would not be present throughout the&para;<br>interrogation, the suspect would have to imagine the counterintuitive&para;<br>and unlikely scenario that, in order to consult counsel, he would be&para;<br>obliged to exit and reenter the interrogation room between each&para;<br>query. Likewise unavailing is the Florida Supreme Court’s conclu&para;<br>sion that the warning was misleading because the temporal language&para;<br>that Powell could “talk to a lawyer before answering any of [the offi&para;<br>cers’] questions” suggested he could consult with an attorney only be&para;<br>fore the interrogation started. In context, the term “before” merely&para;<br>conveyed that Powell’s right to an attorney became effective before he&para;<br>answered any questions at all. Nothing in the words used indicated&para;<br>that counsel’s presence would be restricted after the questioning&para;<br>commenced. Powell suggests that today’s holding will tempt law en&para;<br>forcement agencies to end-run Miranda by amending their warnings&para;<br>to introduce ambiguity. But, as the Federal Government explains, it&para;<br>is in law enforcement’s own interest to state warnings with maxi&para;<br>mum clarity in order to reduce the risk that a court will later find the&para;<br>advice inadequate and therefore suppress a suspect’s statement. The&para;<br>standard warnings used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation are&para;<br>admirably informative, but the Court declines to declare their precise&para;<br>formulation necessary to meet Miranda’s requirements. Different&para;<br>words were used in the advice Powell received, but they communi&para;<br>cated the same message.

App. 3. He&para;<br>then admitted that he owned the handgun found in the&para;<br>apartment. Powell knew he was prohibited from possess&para;<br>ing a gun because he had previously been convicted of a&para;<br>felony, but said he had nevertheless purchased and car&para;<br>ried the firearm for his protection. See 969 So. 2d, at&para;<br>1064; App. 29.&para;<br>Powell was charged in state court with possession of a&para;<br>weapon by a prohibited possessor, in violation of Fla.

The court&para;<br>found that the advice Powell received was misleading&para;<br>because it suggested that Powell could “only consult with&para;<br>an attorney before questioning” and did not convey Pow&para;<br>ell’s entitlement to counsel’s presence throughout the&para;<br>interrogation. Id., at 541. Nor, in the court’s view, did the&para;<br>final catchall warning—“[y]ou have the right to use any of&para;<br>these rights at any time you want during this interview”—&para;<br>cure the defect the court perceived in the right-to-counsel&para;<br>advice: “The catch-all phrase did not supply the missing&para;<br>warning of the right to have counsel present during police&para;<br>questioning,” the court stated, for “a right that has never&para;<br>been expressed cannot be reiterated.” Ibid.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Article I, §9 of the Florida Constitution states that “[n]o person shall&para;<br>. . . be compelled in any criminal matter to be a witness against one&para;<br>self.”&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v.

Brief for Peti&para;<br>tioner 15–23. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,&para;<br>729 (1991) (“This Court will not review a question of fed&para;<br>eral law decided by a state court if the decision . . . rests&para;<br>on a state law ground that is independent of the federal&para;<br>question and adequate to support the judgment.”). “It is&para;<br>fundamental,” we have observed, “that state courts be left&para;<br>free and unfettered by us in interpreting their state con&para;<br>stitutions.” Minnesota v. National Tea Co., 309 U. S. 551,&para;<br>557 (1940). “But it is equally important that ambiguous or&para;<br>obscure adjudications by state courts do not stand as&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Long, 463&para;<br>U. S. 1032, 1040–1041 (1983), the following presumption:&para;<br>“[W]hen . . . a state court decision fairly appears to&para;<br>rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with&para;<br>the federal law, and when the adequacy and inde&para;<br>pendence of any possible state law ground is not clear&para;<br>from the face of the opinion, we will accept as the&para;<br>most reasonable explanation that the state court de&para;<br>cided the case the way it did because it believed that&para;<br>federal law required it to do so.”&para;<br>At the same time, we adopted a plain-statement rule to&para;<br>avoid the presumption: “If the state court decision indi&para;<br>cates clearly and expressly that it is alternatively based on&para;<br>bona fide separate, adequate, and independent grounds,&para;<br>we, of course, will not undertake to review the decision.”&para;<br>Id., at 1041.2&para;<br>Under the Long presumption, we have jurisdiction to&para;<br>entertain this case.

Long, 463 U. S. 1032 (1983), JUSTICE&para;<br>STEVENS did not urge, as he now does, inspection of state-court deci&para;<br>sions to count the number of citations to state and federal provisions&para;<br>and opinions, or heroic efforts to fathom what the state court really&para;<br>meant. See post, at 3–7 (dissenting opinion). Instead, his preferred&para;<br>approach was as clear as the Court’s. In lieu of “presuming that&para;<br>adequate state grounds are not independent unless it clearly appears&para;<br>otherwise,” he would have “presum[ed] that adequate state grounds are&para;<br>independent unless it clearly appears otherwise.” Long, 463 U. S., at&para;<br>1066; see post, at 2, n. 1. Either presumption would avoid arduous&para;<br>efforts to detect, case by case, whether a state ground of decision is&para;<br>truly “independent of the [state court’s] understanding of federal law.”&para;<br>Long, 463 U. S., at 1066. Today, however, the dissent would require&para;<br>this Court to engage in just that sort of inquiry.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. POWELL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>expressly asserted that state-law sources gave Powell&para;<br>rights distinct from, or broader than, those delineated in&para;<br>Miranda. See Long, 463 U.

See,&para;<br>e.g., 998 So. 2d, at 533 (“The issue before this Court is&para;<br>whether the failure to provide express advice of the right&para;<br>to the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation&para;<br>violates the principles espoused in Miranda v. Arizona,&para;<br>384 U.

See&para;<br>Long, 463 U. S., at 1041 (the state court “need only make&para;<br>clear by a plain statement in its judgment or opinion that&para;<br>the federal cases are being used only for the purpose of&para;<br>guidance, and do not themselves compel the result that&para;<br>the court has reached”).4 “To avoid misunderstanding, the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 JUSTICE STEVENS suggests that these statements refer to Miranda&para;<br>only in a “generic” sense to mean “the warnings suspects must be given&para;<br>before interrogation.” Post, at 6. This explanation fails to account for&para;<br>the Florida Supreme Court’s repeated citations to the opinion in&para;<br>Miranda. In context, it is obvious that the court was attempting to&para;<br>home in on what that opinion—which, of course, interpreted only the&para;<br>Federal Constitution and not Florida law—requires.

S., at 441–442, Miranda prescribed the&para;<br>following four now-familiar warnings:&para;<br>“[A suspect] must be warned prior to any questioning&para;<br>[1] that he has the right to remain silent, [2] that any&para;<br>thing he says can be used against him in a court of&para;<br>law, [3] that he has the right to the presence of an at&para;<br>torney, and [4] that if he cannot afford an attorney&para;<br>one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning&para;<br>if he so desires.” Id., at 479.&para;<br>Miranda’s third warning—the only one at issue here—&para;<br>addresses our particular concern that “[t]he circumstances&para;<br>surrounding in-custody interrogation can operate very&para;<br>quickly to overbear the will of one merely made aware of&para;<br>his privilege [to remain silent] by his interrogators.” Id.,&para;<br>at 469. Responsive to that concern, we stated, as “an&para;<br>absolute prerequisite to interrogation,” that an individual&para;<br>held for questioning “must be clearly informed that he has&para;<br>the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer&para;<br>with him during interrogation.” Id., at 471. The question&para;<br>before us is whether the warnings Powell received satis&para;<br>fied this requirement.&para;<br>The four warnings Miranda requires are invariable, but&para;<br>this Court has not dictated the words in which the essen&para;<br>tial information must be conveyed. See California v.&para;<br>Prysock, 453 U. S. 355, 359 (1981) (per curiam) (“This&para;<br>Court has never indicated that the rigidity of Miranda&para;<br>extends to the precise formulation of the warnings given a&para;<br>criminal defendant.” (internal quotation marks omitted));&para;<br>Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U. S. 291, 297 (1980) (safe&para;<br>guards against self-incrimination include “Miranda warn&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ings . . . or their equivalent”). In determining whether&para;<br>police officers adequately conveyed the four warnings, we&para;<br>have said, reviewing courts are not required to examine&para;<br>the words employed “as if construing a will or defining the&para;<br>terms of an easement. The inquiry is simply whether the&para;<br>warnings reasonably ‘conve[y] to [a suspect] his rights as&para;<br>required by Miranda.’ ” Duckworth, 492 U. S., at 203&para;<br>(quoting Prysock, 453 U. S., at 361).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Our decisions in Prysock and Duckworth inform our&para;<br>judgment here. Both concerned a suspect’s entitlement to&para;<br>adequate notification of the right to appointed counsel. In&para;<br>Prysock, an officer informed the suspect of, inter alia, his&para;<br>right to a lawyer’s presence during questioning and his&para;<br>right to counsel appointed at no cost. 453 U. S., at 356–&para;<br>357. The Court of Appeals held the advice inadequate to&para;<br>comply with Miranda because it lacked an express state&para;<br>ment that the appointment of an attorney would occur&para;<br>prior to the impending interrogation. See 453 U. S., at&para;<br>358–359. We reversed. Id., at 362. “[N]othing in the&para;<br>warnings,” we observed, “suggested any limitation on the&para;<br>right to the presence of appointed counsel different from&para;<br>the clearly conveyed rights to a lawyer in general, includ&para;<br>ing the right to a lawyer before [the suspect is] questioned,&para;<br>. . . while [he is] being questioned, and all during the&para;<br>questioning.” Id., at 360–361 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>Similarly, in Duckworth, we upheld advice that, in&para;<br>relevant part, communicated the right to have an attorney&para;<br>present during the interrogation and the right to an ap&para;<br>pointed attorney, but also informed the suspect that the&para;<br>lawyer would be appointed “if and when [the suspect goes]&para;<br>to court.” 492 U. S., at 198 (emphasis deleted; internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). “The Court of Appeals thought&para;<br>th[e] ‘if and when you go to court’ language suggested that&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. POWELL&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>only those accused who can afford an attorney have the&para;<br>right to have one present before answering any ques&para;<br>tions. ” Id., at 203 (some internal quotation marks omit&para;<br>ted). We thought otherwise. Under the relevant state&para;<br>law, we noted, “counsel is appointed at [a] defendant’s&para;<br>initial appearance in court.” Id., at 204. The “if and when&para;<br>you go to court” advice, we said, “simply anticipate[d]” a&para;<br>question the suspect might be expected to ask after receiv&para;<br>ing Miranda warnings, i.e., “when [will he] obtain coun&para;<br>sel.” 492 U. S., at 204. Reading the “if and when” lan&para;<br>guage together with the other information conveyed, we&para;<br>held that the warnings, “in their totality, satisfied&para;<br>Miranda.” Id., at 205.&para;<br>We reach the same conclusion in this case. The Tampa&para;<br>officers did not “entirely omi[t],” post, at 9, any informa&para;<br>tion Miranda required them to impart. They informed&para;<br>Powell that he had “the right to talk to a lawyer before&para;<br>answering any of [their] questions” and “the right to use&para;<br>any of [his] rights at any time [he] want[ed] during th[e]&para;<br>interview.” App. 3. The first statement communicated&para;<br>that Powell could consult with a lawyer before answering&para;<br>any particular question, and the second statement con&para;<br>firmed that he could exercise that right while the interro&para;<br>gation was underway. In combination, the two warnings&para;<br>reasonably conveyed Powell’s right to have an attorney&para;<br>present, not only at the outset of interrogation, but at all&para;<br>times.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 JUSTICE STEVENS asserts that the Court today approves, for “the&para;<br>first time[,] . . . a warning which, if given its natural reading, entirely&para;<br>omitted an essential element of a suspect’s rights.” Post, at 9. See also&para;<br>post, at 12 (“[T]he warning entirely failed to inform [Powell] of the&para;<br>separate and distinct right ‘to have counsel present during any ques&para;<br>tioning.’ ”). We find the warning in this case adequate, however, only&para;<br>because it communicated just what Miranda prescribed. JUSTICE&para;<br>STEVENS ascribes a different meaning to the warning Powell received,&para;<br>but he cannot credibly suggest that the Court regards the warning to&para;<br>have omitted a vital element of Powell’s rights.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>To reach the opposite conclusion, i.e., that the attorney&para;<br>would not be present throughout the interrogation, the&para;<br>suspect would have to imagine an unlikely scenario: To&para;<br>consult counsel, he would be obliged to exit and reenter&para;<br>the interrogation room between each query. A reasonable&para;<br>suspect in a custodial setting who has just been read his&para;<br>rights, we believe, would not come to the counterintuitive&para;<br>conclusion that he is obligated, or allowed, to hop in and&para;<br>out of the holding area to seek his attorney’s advice.6&para;<br>Instead, the suspect would likely assume that he must&para;<br>stay put in the interrogation room and that his lawyer&para;<br>would be there with him the entire time.7&para;<br>The Florida Supreme Court found the warning mislead&para;<br>ing because it believed the temporal language—that Pow&para;<br>ell could “talk to a lawyer before answering any of [the&para;<br>officers’] questions”—suggested Powell could consult with&para;<br>an attorney only before the interrogation started. 998&para;<br>So. 2d, at 541. See also Brief for Respondent 28–29. In&para;<br>context, however, the term “before” merely conveyed when&para;<br>Powell’s right to an attorney became effective—namely,&para;<br>before he answered any questions at all. Nothing in the&para;<br>words used indicated that counsel’s presence would be&para;<br>restricted after the questioning commenced. Instead, the&para;<br>warning communicated that the right to counsel carried&para;<br>forward to and through the interrogation: Powell could&para;<br>seek his attorney’s advice before responding to “any of [the&para;<br>officers’] questions” and “at any time . . . during th[e]&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 It is equally unlikely that the suspect would anticipate a scenario of&para;<br>this order: His lawyer would be admitted into the interrogation room&para;<br>each time the police ask him a question, then ushered out each time the&para;<br>suspect responds.&para;<br>7 Although it does not bear on our decision, Powell seems to have&para;<br>understood the warning this way. The following exchange between&para;<br>Powell and his attorney occurred when Powell testified at his trial:&para;<br>“Q.

Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 41–44. If we find the advice he received ade&para;<br>quate, Powell suggests, law enforcement agencies, hoping&para;<br>to obtain uninformed waivers, will be tempted to end-run&para;<br>Miranda by amending their warnings to introduce ambi&para;<br>guity. Brief for Respondent 50–53. But as the United&para;<br>States explained as amicus curiae in support of the State&para;<br>of Florida, “law enforcement agencies have little reason to&para;<br>assume the litigation risk of experimenting with novel&para;<br>Miranda formulations,” Brief for United States as Amicus&para;<br>Curiae 6; instead, it is “desirable police practice” and “in&para;<br>law enforcement’s own interest” to state warnings with&para;<br>maximum clarity, id., at 12. See also id., at 11 (“By using&para;<br>a conventional and precise formulation of the warnings,&para;<br>police can significantly reduce the risk that a court will&para;<br>later suppress the suspect’s statement on the ground that&para;<br>the advice was inadequate.”).&para;<br>For these reasons, “all . . . federal law enforcement&para;<br>agencies explicitly advise . . . suspect[s] of the full contours&para;<br>of each [Miranda] right, including the right to the pres&para;<br>ence of counsel during questioning.” Id., at 12.

In my view, the Florida Supreme Court&para;<br>held on an adequate and independent state-law ground&para;<br>that the warnings provided to Powell did not sufficiently&para;<br>inform him of the “ ‘right to a lawyer’s help’ ” under the&para;<br>Florida Constitution, id., at 535. This Court therefore&para;<br>lacks jurisdiction to review the judgment below, notwith&para;<br>standing the failure of that court to include some express&para;<br>sentence that would satisfy this Court’s “plain-statement&para;<br>rule,” ante, at 5.&para;<br>The adequate-and-independent-state-ground doctrine&para;<br>rests on two “cornerstones”: “[r]espect for the independ&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v.

S. 1032, 1040 (1983).&para;<br>In Long, the Court adopted a novel presumption in favor&para;<br>of jurisdiction when the independence of a state court’s&para;<br>state-law judgment is not clear. But we only respect the&para;<br>independence of state courts and avoid rendering advisory&para;<br>opinions if we limit the application of that presumption to&para;<br>truly ambiguous cases.1 This is not such a case.&para;<br>“[I]f the same judgment would be rendered by the state&para;<br>court after we corrected its views of federal laws, our&para;<br>review could amount to nothing more than an advisory&para;<br>opinion.” Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 126 (1945). In&para;<br>Long we advised every state court of a formula by which it&para;<br>could assure us that our review would indeed amount to&para;<br>nothing more than an advisory opinion. The state court&para;<br>“need only make clear by a plain statement in its judg&para;<br>ment or opinion that the federal cases are being used only&para;<br>for the purpose of guidance, and do not themselves compel&para;<br>the result that the court has reached.” 463 U. S., at 1041.&para;<br>That advice has sometimes been misunderstood as a com&para;<br>mand that unless such a plain statement is included in a&para;<br>state-court opinion, the court’s ruling cannot have rested&para;<br>on an adequate and independent state ground. But the&para;<br>real question is whether “the adequacy and independence&para;<br>of any possible state law ground is . . . clear from the face&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 In my view, this Court would better respect the independence of&para;<br>state courts by applying the opposite presumption, as it did in the years&para;<br>prior to 1983. See Long, 463 U. S., at 1066–1067 (STEVENS, J., dissent&para;<br>ing). But accepting Long as the law, we can limit its negative effects—&para;<br>unnecessary intrusion into the business of the state courts and unnec&para;<br>essary advisory opinions—only if we limit its application to cases in&para;<br>which the independence of the state-law ground is in serious doubt.&para;<br>See Pennsylvania v. Labron, 518 U. S. 938, 950 (1996) (STEVENS, J.,&para;<br>dissenting) (“[T]he unfortunate effects of [its] rule” are “exacerbate[d]&para;<br>. . . to a nearly intolerable degree” when the Long presumption is&para;<br>applied to cases in which “the state-law ground supporting th[e] judg&para;<br>men[t] is so much clearer than has been true on most prior occasions”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Even if a state court&para;<br>opinion does not include the magic words set forth in&para;<br>Long, or some similarly explicit sentence, we lack jurisdic&para;<br>tion if it is nonetheless apparent that the decision is in&para;<br>deed supported by an adequate and independent state&para;<br>ground. Contrary to the assumption made by the Court,&para;<br>we have no power to assume jurisdiction that does not&para;<br>otherwise exist simply because the Florida Supreme Court&para;<br>did not include in its decision some express statement that&para;<br>its interpretation of state law is independent.&para;<br>In my view, we can tell from the face of the Florida&para;<br>Supreme Court’s opinion that “the decision rested on a&para;<br>state ground separate from Miranda,” ante, at 6. This&para;<br>case is easily distinguished from Long in that regard. In&para;<br>Long, although the Michigan Supreme Court had twice&para;<br>cited the Michigan Constitution in its opinion, it “relied&para;<br>exclusively on its understanding of Terry [v. Ohio, 392&para;<br>U. S. 1 (1968),] and other federal cases. Not a single state&para;<br>case was cited to support the state court’s holding that the&para;<br>search of the passenger compartment was unconstitu&para;<br>tional.” 463 U. S., at 1043. There was, in short, nothing&para;<br>to “indicate that the decision below rested on grounds in&para;<br>any way independent from the state court’s interpretation&para;<br>of federal law.” Id., at 1044.&para;<br>Other cases in which we have applied the Long pre&para;<br>sumption have been similarly devoid of independent state&para;<br>law analysis. We typically apply the Long presumption&para;<br>when the state court’s decision cited a state constitutional&para;<br>provision only a few times or not at all, and rested exclu&para;<br>sively upon federal cases or upon state cases that them&para;<br>selves cited only federal law.2 We have also applied Long&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 See, e.g., Illinois v.

I, §9 of the Florida&para;<br>Constitution. For example, after a paragraph describing&para;<br>the general scope of Miranda warnings under federal law,&para;<br>the Court explained the general scope of warnings under&para;<br>state law. 998 So. 2d, at 534–535 (“[T]o ensure the volun&para;<br>tariness of confessions as required by article I, section 9 of&para;<br>the Florida Constitution, this Court in Traylor v.

The court consistently referred to these state-law&para;<br>rights as separate and distinct from Miranda, noting that&para;<br>in its earlier cases, it had explained that “the require&para;<br>ments of both the Fifth Amendment, as explained in&para;<br>Miranda, and the Florida Constitution, as explained in&para;<br>Traylor,” include “the requirement that a suspect be in&para;<br>formed of the right to have counsel present during ques&para;<br>tioning.” 998 So. 2d, at 537–538. And when applying the&para;<br>law to the specific facts of this case, the Florida Supreme&para;<br>Court again invoked the specific and distinct “right to a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>court’s opinion analyzed federal law. 518 U.

The Court’s&para;<br>analysis proved wrong; on remand, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court&para;<br>reaffirmed its prior holding and “explicitly note[d] that it was, in fact,&para;<br>decided upon independent grounds, i.e., Article I, Section 8 of the&para;<br>Pennsylvania Constitution.” Commonwealth v.

That we have overreached before is no&para;<br>reason to repeat the mistake again.&para;<br>5 In examining what the state-court opinion said regarding state law,&para;<br>and whether the state precedent cited in the opinion relied upon state&para;<br>law, I am undertaking no effort more arduous than what the Court has&para;<br>typically undertaken in order to determine whether the Long presump&para;<br>tion applies: examining how frequently a state-court opinion cited state&para;<br>law, whether state law is coextensive with federal law, and whether the&para;<br>cited state cases relied upon federal law.

Id., at 540.&para;<br>Moreover, the state cases relied upon by the Florida&para;<br>Supreme Court did not themselves rely exclusively on&para;<br>federal law. The primary case relied upon for the state&para;<br>law holding, Traylor, rested exclusively upon state law.&para;<br>See 596 So. 2d, at 961. In that decision, the Florida Su&para;<br>preme Court embraced the principle that “[w]hen called&para;<br>upon to decide matters of fundamental rights, Florida’s&para;<br>state courts are bound under federalist principles to give&para;<br>primacy to our state Constitution and to give independent&para;<br>legal import to every phrase and clause contained&para;<br>therein.” Id., at 962. Elaborating upon the meaning of&para;<br>Art. I, §9 of the Florida Constitution, the Florida Supreme&para;<br>Court explained the roots of Florida’s commitment to&para;<br>protecting its citizens from self-incrimination. Florida has&para;<br>long “required as a matter of state law that one charged&para;<br>with a crime be informed of his rights prior to rendering a&para;<br>confession.” Id., at 964. It has required warnings before&para;<br>some interrogations since at least 1889, and has for that&para;<br>long excluded confessions obtained in violation of those&para;<br>rules. Ibid. In sum, this case looks quite different from&para;<br>those cases in which we have applied the Long presump&para;<br>tion in the past.&para;<br>The Court concludes otherwise by relying primarily&para;<br>upon the formulation of the certified question and re&para;<br>statements of that question within the Florida Supreme&para;<br>Court’s opinion. See ante, at 6. Yet while the certified&para;<br>question asks whether particular phrases “vitiate[d]&para;<br>Miranda warnings,” 998 So. 2d, at 532 (capitalization and&para;<br>footnote omitted), Miranda has become a generic term to&para;<br>refer to the warnings suspects must be given before inter&para;<br>rogation, see Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 792&para;<br>(11th ed. 2003) (defining “Miranda” as “of, relating to, or&para;<br>being the legal rights of an arrested person to have an&para;<br>attorney and to remain silent so as to avoid self&para;<br>incrimination”). Thus, its invocation of Miranda in the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

In reaching its state-law&para;<br>holding, the Florida Supreme Court found Miranda and&para;<br>our other precedents instructive.6 But that alone is insuf&para;<br>ficient to assure our jurisdiction, even under Long. In my&para;<br>view, the judgment—reversal of Powell’s conviction—is&para;<br>supported by the Florida Supreme Court’s independent&para;<br>and carefully considered holding that these warnings were&para;<br>inadequate under the Florida Constitution. See 998&para;<br>So. 2d, at 534–535, 537–538, 540, 542.&para;<br>The Court acknowledges that nothing in today’s decision&para;<br>“trenches on the Florida Supreme Court’s authority to&para;<br>impose, based on the State’s Constitution, any additional&para;<br>protections against coerced confessions it deems appropri&para;<br>ate.” Ante, at 7. As the Florida Supreme Court has noted&para;<br>on more than one occasion, its interpretation of the Flor&para;<br>ida Constitution’s privilege against self-incrimination need&para;<br>not track our construction of the parallel provision in the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The Florida Supreme Court need not have decided that state-law&para;<br>sources “gave Powell rights . . . broader than . . . those delineated in&para;<br>Miranda,” ante, at 6, in order for its judgment to have rested upon an&para;<br>independent state-law ground. The independence of a state-law ground&para;<br>may be especially clear when a state court explicitly finds that the state&para;<br>constitution is more protective of a certain right than the national&para;<br>charter, but a state constitutional provision is no less independent for&para;<br>providing the same protection in a given case as does the federal&para;<br>provision, so long as the content of the state-law right is not compelled&para;<br>by or dependent upon federal law. Unlike other provisions of Art. I of&para;<br>the Florida Constitution, §9 does not contain an express proviso requir&para;<br>ing that the right be construed in conformity with the analogous federal&para;<br>provision. Compare Fla. Const., Art. I, §9, with Fla. Const., Art I, §12.&para;<br>Furthermore, under Florida law the scope of Art. I, §9 is clearly not&para;<br>dependent upon federal law. Rigterink v.

In this&para;<br>very case, the Florida Supreme Court may reinstate its&para;<br>judgment upon remand. If the Florida Supreme Court&para;<br>does so, as I expect it will, this Court’s opinion on the&para;<br>merits will qualify as the sort of advisory opinion that we&para;<br>should studiously seek to avoid.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Court’s decision on the merits is also unpersuasive.&para;<br>As we recognized in Miranda, “the right to have counsel&para;<br>present at [an] interrogation is indispensable to the pro&para;<br>tection of the Fifth Amendment privilege.” Miranda v.&para;<br>Arizona, 384 U.

Furthermore, “the&para;<br>need for counsel to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege&para;<br>comprehends not merely a right to consult with counsel&para;<br>prior to questioning, but also to have counsel present&para;<br>during any questioning.” Id., at 470. Because the “ac&para;<br>cused who does not know his rights and therefore does not&para;<br>make a request may be the person who most needs coun&para;<br>sel,” id., at 470–471, a defendant “must be clearly in&para;<br>formed” regarding two aspects of his right to consult an&para;<br>attorney: “the right to consult with a lawyer and to have&para;<br>the lawyer with him during interrogation,” id., at 471.&para;<br>In this case, the form regularly used by the Tampa&para;<br>police warned Powell that he had “the right to talk to a&para;<br>lawyer before answering any of our questions.” App. 3.&para;<br>This informed him only of the right to consult with a&para;<br>lawyer before questioning, the very right the Miranda&para;<br>Court identified as insufficient to protect the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment privilege. The warning did not say anything&para;<br>about the right to have counsel present during interroga&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Although we have never required “rigidity in the&para;<br>form of the required warnings,” California v. Prysock, 453&para;<br>U. S. 355, 359 (1981) (per curiam), this is, I believe, the&para;<br>first time the Court has approved a warning which, if&para;<br>given its natural reading, entirely omitted an essential&para;<br>element of a suspect’s rights.&para;<br>Despite the failure of the warning to mention it, in the&para;<br>Court’s view the warning “reasonably conveyed” to Powell&para;<br>that he had the right to a lawyer’s presence during the&para;<br>interrogation. Ante, at 10. The Court cobbles together&para;<br>this conclusion from two elements of the warning. First,&para;<br>the Court assumes the warning regarding Powell’s right&para;<br>“to talk to a lawyer before answering any of [the officers’]&para;<br>questions,” App. 3, conveyed that “Powell could consult&para;<br>with a lawyer before answering any particular question,”&para;<br>ante, at 10 (emphasis added).7 Second, in the Court’s&para;<br>view, the addition of a catchall clause at the end of the&para;<br>recitation of rights “confirmed” that Powell could use his&para;<br>right to consult an attorney “while the interrogation was&para;<br>underway.” Ibid.&para;<br>The more natural reading of the warning Powell was&para;<br>given, which (1) contained a temporal limit and (2) failed&para;<br>to mention his right to the presence of counsel in the&para;<br>interrogation room, is that Powell only had the right to&para;<br>consult with an attorney before the interrogation began,&para;<br>not that he had the right to have an attorney with him&para;<br>during questioning. Even those few Courts of Appeals&para;<br>that have approved warnings that did not expressly men&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 This&para;<br>&para;<br>assumption makes it easier for the Court to conclude the warn&para;<br>ing conveyed a right to have a lawyer present. If a suspect is told he&para;<br>has the right to consult with an attorney before answering any particu&para;<br>lar question, the Court may be correct that he would reasonably con&para;<br>clude he has the right to a lawyer’s presence because otherwise he&para;<br>would have to imagine he could consult his attorney in some unlikely&para;<br>fashion (e.g., by leaving the interrogation room between every ques&para;<br>tion).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. POWELL&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tion the right to an attorney’s presence during interroga&para;<br>tion8 have found language of the sort used in Powell’s&para;<br>warning to be misleading. For instance, petitioner cites&para;<br>the Second Circuit’s decision in United States v. Lamia,&para;<br>429 F. 2d 373 (1970), as an example of a court applying&para;<br>the properly flexible approach to Miranda. But in that&para;<br>case, the Second Circuit expressly distinguished a warning&para;<br>that a suspect “ ‘could consult an attorney prior to any&para;<br>question,’ ” which was “affirmatively misleading since it&para;<br>was thought to imply that the attorney could not be pre&para;<br>sent during questioning.” 429 F. 2d, at 377.9 That even&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Several Courts of Appeals have held that warnings that did not&para;<br>expressly inform a suspect of his right to have counsel present during&para;<br>interrogation did not adequately inform a suspect of his Miranda&para;<br>rights. See, e.g., United States v. Tillman, 963 F. 2d 137, 141 (CA6&para;<br>1992); United States v. Bland, 908 F. 2d 471, 474 (CA9 1990); United&para;<br>States v. Anthon, 648 F. 2d 669, 672–673 (CA10 1981); Windsor v.&para;<br>United States, 389 F. 2d 530, 533 (CA5 1968). And most of the Circuits&para;<br>that have not required express mention of the right to an attorney’s&para;<br>presence have approved only general warnings regarding the right to&para;<br>an attorney; that is, warnings which did not specifically mention the&para;<br>right to counsel’s presence during interrogation but which also con&para;<br>tained no limiting words that might mislead a suspect as to the broad&para;<br>nature of his right to counsel. See, e.g., United States v. Frankson, 83&para;<br>F. 3d 79, 82 (CA4 1996); United States v. Caldwell, 954 F. 2d 496, 502&para;<br>(CA8 1992); United States v. Adams, 484 F. 2d 357, 361–362 (CA7&para;<br>1973). I am doubtful that warning a suspect of his “right to counsel,”&para;<br>without more, reasonably conveys a suspect’s full rights under&para;<br>Miranda, but at least such a general warning does not include the same&para;<br>sort of misleading temporal limitation as in Powell’s warning.&para;<br>9 Petitioner also cites Bridgers v. Dretke, 431 F. 3d 853 (CA5 2005), in&para;<br>which the Fifth Circuit held the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did&para;<br>not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law in finding&para;<br>adequate a warning in which a suspect was informed that “he had the&para;<br>right to the presence of an attorney before any questioning commenced.”&para;<br>Id., at 857 (internal quotation marks omitted). But even assuming that&para;<br>warning would sufficiently apprise an individual of his right to an&para;<br>attorney’s presence during interrogation, the fact that the warning&para;<br>mentioned an attorney’s presence materially distinguishes it from the&para;<br>warning Powell received. The Fifth Circuit quoted with approval the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the Courts of Appeals taking the most flexible approach to&para;<br>Miranda have found warnings like Powell’s misleading&para;<br>should caution the Court against concluding that such a&para;<br>warning reasonably conveyed Powell’s right to have an&para;<br>attorney with him during the interrogation.&para;<br>When the relevant clause of the warning in this case is&para;<br>given its most natural reading, the catchall clause does&para;<br>not meaningfully clarify Powell’s rights. It communicated&para;<br>that Powell could exercise the previously listed rights at&para;<br>any time. Yet the only previously listed right was the&para;<br>“right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of [the&para;<br>officers’] questions.” App. 3 (emphasis added). Informing&para;<br>Powell that he could exercise, at any time during the&para;<br>interview, the right to talk to a lawyer before answering&para;<br>any questions did not reasonably convey the right to talk&para;<br>to a lawyer after answering some questions, much less&para;<br>implicitly inform Powell of his right to have a lawyer with&para;<br>him at all times during interrogation. An intelligent&para;<br>suspect could reasonably conclude that all he was provided&para;<br>was a one-time right to consult with an attorney, not a&para;<br>right to have an attorney present with him in the interro&para;<br>gation room at all times.10&para;<br>——————&para;<br>state court’s assessment that warning a suspect solely that “he had the&para;<br>right to consult or speak to an attorney before questioning . . . might&para;<br>have created the [impermissible] impression that the attorney could not&para;<br>be present during interrogation.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>10 The Court supports its analysis by taking note of Powell’s testi&para;<br>mony at trial, given after the trial judge had overruled his lawyer’s&para;<br>objection that the warning he received was inadequate. In my view, the&para;<br>testimony in context is not probative of what Powell thought the&para;<br>warnings meant. It did not explore what Powell understood the warn&para;<br>ings to mean, but simply established, as a prelude to Powell’s testimony&para;<br>explaining his prior statement, that he had waived his rights. Regard&para;<br>less, the testimony is irrelevant, as the Court acknowledges. “No&para;<br>amount of circumstantial evidence that a person may have been aware&para;<br>of [the right to have a lawyer with him during interrogation] will suffice&para;<br>to stand” in the stead of an adequate warning. Miranda v. Arizona, 384&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA v. POWELL&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>The Court relies on Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S. 195&para;<br>(1989), and Prysock, 453 U. S. 355, but in neither case did&para;<br>the warning at issue completely omit one of a suspect’s&para;<br>rights. In Prysock, the warning regarding the right to an&para;<br>appointed attorney contained no temporal limitation, see&para;<br>id., at 360–361, which clearly distinguishes that case from&para;<br>Powell’s. In Duckworth, the suspect was explicitly in&para;<br>formed that he had the right “to talk to a lawyer for advice&para;<br>before we ask you any questions, and to have him with you&para;<br>during questioning,” and that he had “this right to the&para;<br>advice and presence of a lawyer even if you cannot afford&para;<br>to hire one.” 492 U. S., at 198 (emphasis deleted; internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). The warning thus conveyed in&para;<br>full the right to appointed counsel before and during the&para;<br>interrogation. Although the warning was arguably under&para;<br>cut by the addition of a statement that an attorney would&para;<br>be appointed “if and when you go to court,” the Court&para;<br>found the suspect was informed of his full rights and the&para;<br>warning simply added additional, truthful information&para;<br>regarding when counsel would be appointed. Ibid. (em&para;<br>phasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted). Unlike&para;<br>the Duckworth warning, Powell’s warning did not convey&para;<br>his Miranda rights in full with the addition of some ar&para;<br>guably misleading statement. Rather, the warning en&para;<br>tirely failed to inform him of the separate and distinct&para;<br>right “to have counsel present during any questioning.”&para;<br>Miranda, 384 U. S., at 470.&para;<br>In sum, the warning at issue in this case did not rea&para;<br>sonably convey to Powell his right to have a lawyer with&para;<br>him during the interrogation. “The requirement of warn&para;<br>ings . . . [is] fundamental with respect to the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment privilege and not simply a preliminary ritual&para;<br>to existing methods of interrogation.” Id., at 476.
