HOLDER, ATTORNEY&para;<br>GENERAL, ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–96. Argued February 27, 2013—Decided June 25, 2013&para;<br>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to address entrenched racial&para;<br>discrimination in voting, “an insidious and pervasive evil which had&para;<br>been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting&para;<br>and ingenious defiance of the Constitution.” South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 309. Section 2 of the Act, which bans any&para;<br>“standard, practice, or procedure” that “results in a denial or&para;<br>abridgement of the right of any citizen . . . to vote on account of race&para;<br>or color,” 42 U. S. C. §1973(a), applies nationwide, is permanent, and&para;<br>is not at issue in this case. Other sections apply only to some parts of&para;<br>the country. Section 4 of the Act provides the “coverage formula,” defining the “covered jurisdictions” as States or political subdivisions&para;<br>that maintained tests or devices as prerequisites to voting, and had&para;<br>low voter registration or turnout, in the 1960s and early 1970s.&para;<br>§1973b(b). In those covered jurisdictions, §5 of the Act provides that&para;<br>no change in voting procedures can take effect until approved by&para;<br>specified federal authorities in Washington, D. C. §1973c(a). Such&para;<br>approval is known as “preclearance.”&para;<br>The coverage formula and preclearance requirement were initially&para;<br>set to expire after five years, but the Act has been reauthorized several times. In 2006, the Act was reauthorized for an additional 25&para;<br>years, but the coverage formula was not changed. Coverage still&para;<br>turned on whether a jurisdiction had a voting test in the 1960s or&para;<br>1970s, and had low voter registration or turnout at that time. Shortly after the 2006 reauthorization, a Texas utility district sought to&para;<br>bail out from the Act’s coverage and, in the alternative, challenged&para;<br>the Act’s constitutionality. This Court resolved the challenge on&para;<br>statutory grounds, but expressed serious doubts about the Act’s con-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tinued constitutionality. See Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist.&para;<br>No. One v. Holder, 557 U. S. 193.&para;<br>Petitioner Shelby County, in the covered jurisdiction of Alabama,&para;<br>sued the Attorney General in Federal District Court in Washington,&para;<br>D. C., seeking a declaratory judgment that sections 4(b) and 5 are facially unconstitutional, as well as a permanent injunction against&para;<br>their enforcement. The District Court upheld the Act, finding that&para;<br>the evidence before Congress in 2006 was sufficient to justify reauthorizing §5 and continuing §4(b)’s coverage formula. The D. C. Circuit affirmed. After surveying the evidence in the record, that court&para;<br>accepted Congress’s conclusion that §2 litigation remained inadequate in the covered jurisdictions to protect the rights of minority&para;<br>voters, that §5 was therefore still necessary, and that the coverage&para;<br>formula continued to pass constitutional muster.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional; its formula&para;<br>can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance. Pp. 9–25.&para;<br>(a) In Northwest Austin, this Court noted that the Voting Rights&para;<br>Act “imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs”&para;<br>and concluded that “a departure from the fundamental principle of&para;<br>equal sovereignty requires a showing that a statute’s disparate geographic coverage is sufficiently related to the problem that it targets.”&para;<br>557 U. S., at 203. These basic principles guide review of the question&para;<br>presented here. Pp. 9–17.&para;<br>(1) State legislation may not contravene federal law. States retain broad autonomy, however, in structuring their governments and&para;<br>pursuing legislative objectives. Indeed, the Tenth Amendment reserves to the States all powers not specifically granted to the Federal&para;<br>Government, including “the power to regulate elections.” Gregory v.&para;<br>Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 461–462. There is also a “fundamental principle of equal sovereignty” among the States, which is highly pertinent in assessing disparate treatment of States. Northwest Austin,&para;<br>supra, at 203.&para;<br>The Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic principles.&para;<br>It requires States to beseech the Federal Government for permission&para;<br>to implement laws that they would otherwise have the right to enact&para;<br>and execute on their own. And despite the tradition of equal sovereignty, the Act applies to only nine States (and additional counties).&para;<br>That is why, in 1966, this Court described the Act as “stringent” and&para;<br>“potent,” Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 308, 315, 337. The Court nonetheless upheld the Act, concluding that such an “uncommon exercise of&para;<br>congressional power” could be justified by “exceptional conditions.”&para;<br>Id., at 334. Pp. 9–12.&para;<br>(2) In 1966, these departures were justified by the “blight of ra-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>cial discrimination in voting” that had “infected the electoral process&para;<br>in parts of our country for nearly a century,” Katzenbach, 383 U. S.,&para;<br>at 308. At the time, the coverage formula—the means of linking the&para;<br>exercise of the unprecedented authority with the problem that warranted it—made sense. The Act was limited to areas where Congress&para;<br>found “evidence of actual voting discrimination,” and the covered jurisdictions shared two characteristics: “the use of tests and devices&para;<br>for voter registration, and a voting rate in the 1964 presidential election at least 12 points below the national average.” Id., at 330. The&para;<br>Court explained that “[t]ests and devices are relevant to voting discrimination because of their long history as a tool for perpetrating&para;<br>the evil; a low voting rate is pertinent for the obvious reason that&para;<br>widespread disenfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of&para;<br>actual voters.” Ibid. The Court therefore concluded that “the coverage formula [was] rational in both practice and theory.” Ibid.&para;<br>Pp. 12–13.&para;<br>(3) Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically.&para;<br>Largely because of the Voting Rights Act, “[v]oter turnout and registration rates” in covered jurisdictions “now approach parity. Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority&para;<br>candidates hold office at unprecedented levels.” Northwest Austin,&para;<br>supra, at 202. The tests and devices that blocked ballot access have&para;<br>been forbidden nationwide for over 40 years. Yet the Act has not&para;<br>eased §5’s restrictions or narrowed the scope of §4’s coverage formula&para;<br>along the way. Instead those extraordinary and unprecedented features have been reauthorized as if nothing has changed, and they&para;<br>have grown even stronger. Because §5 applies only to those jurisdictions singled out by §4, the Court turns to consider that provision.&para;<br>Pp. 13–17.&para;<br>(b) Section 4’s formula is unconstitutional in light of current conditions. Pp. 17–25.&para;<br>(1) In 1966, the coverage formula was “rational in both practice&para;<br>and theory.” Katzenbach, supra, at 330. It looked to cause (discriminatory tests) and effect (low voter registration and turnout), and tailored the remedy (preclearance) to those jurisdictions exhibiting both.&para;<br>By 2009, however, the “coverage formula raise[d] serious constitutional questions.” Northwest Austin, supra, at 204. Coverage today&para;<br>is based on decades-old data and eradicated practices. The formula&para;<br>captures States by reference to literacy tests and low voter registration and turnout in the 1960s and early 1970s. But such tests have&para;<br>been banned for over 40 years. And voter registration and turnout&para;<br>numbers in covered States have risen dramatically. In 1965, the&para;<br>States could be divided into those with a recent history of voting tests&para;<br>and low voter registration and turnout and those without those char-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>acteristics. Congress based its coverage formula on that distinction.&para;<br>Today the Nation is no longer divided along those lines, yet the Voting Rights Act continues to treat it as if it were. Pp. 17–18.&para;<br>(2) The Government attempts to defend the formula on grounds&para;<br>that it is “reverse-engineered”—Congress identified the jurisdictions&para;<br>to be covered and then came up with criteria to describe them. Katzenbach did not sanction such an approach, reasoning instead that&para;<br>the coverage formula was rational because the “formula . . . was relevant to the problem.” 383 U. S., at 329, 330. The Government has a&para;<br>fallback argument—because the formula was relevant in 1965, its&para;<br>continued use is permissible so long as any discrimination remains in&para;<br>the States identified in 1965. But this does not look to “current political conditions,” Northwest Austin, supra, at 203, instead relying on a&para;<br>comparison between the States in 1965. But history did not end in&para;<br>1965. In assessing the “current need[ ]” for a preclearance system&para;<br>treating States differently from one another today, history since 1965&para;<br>cannot be ignored. The Fifteenth Amendment is not designed to punish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future. To serve&para;<br>that purpose, Congress—if it is to divide the States—must identify&para;<br>those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense in&para;<br>light of current conditions. Pp. 18–21.&para;<br>(3) Respondents also rely heavily on data from the record compiled by Congress before reauthorizing the Act. Regardless of how&para;<br>one looks at that record, no one can fairly say that it shows anything&para;<br>approaching the “pervasive,” “flagrant,” “widespread,” and “rampant”&para;<br>discrimination that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions&para;<br>from the rest of the Nation in 1965. Katzenbach, supra, at 308, 315,&para;<br>331. But a more fundamental problem remains: Congress did not use&para;<br>that record to fashion a coverage formula grounded in current conditions. It instead re-enacted a formula based on 40-year-old facts having no logical relation to the present day. Pp. 21–22.&para;<br>&para;<br>679 F. 3d 848, reversed.&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

Section 5&para;<br>of the Act required States to obtain federal permission&para;<br>before enacting any law related to voting—a drastic departure from basic principles of federalism. And §4 of the Act&para;<br>applied that requirement only to some States—an equally&para;<br>dramatic departure from the principle that all States&para;<br>enjoy equal sovereignty. This was strong medicine, but&para;<br>Congress determined it was needed to address entrenched&para;<br>racial discrimination in voting, “an insidious and pervasive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of&para;<br>our country through unremitting and ingenious defiance&para;<br>of the Constitution.” South Carolina v. Katzenbach,&para;<br>383 U. S. 301, 309 (1966). As we explained in upholding&para;<br>the law, “exceptional conditions can justify legislative&para;<br>measures not otherwise appropriate.” Id., at 334. Reflecting the unprecedented nature of these measures, they&para;<br>were scheduled to expire after five years. See Voting&para;<br>Rights Act of 1965, §4(a), 79 Stat. 438.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Nearly 50 years later, they are still in effect; indeed,&para;<br>they have been made more stringent, and are now scheduled to last until 2031. There is no denying, however, that&para;<br>the conditions that originally justified these measures no&para;<br>longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions. By&para;<br>2009, “the racial gap in voter registration and turnout&para;<br>[was] lower in the States originally covered by §5 than it&para;<br>[was] nationwide.” Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist.&para;<br>No. One v. Holder, 557 U. S. 193, 203–204 (2009). Since&para;<br>that time, Census Bureau data indicate that AfricanAmerican voter turnout has come to exceed white voter&para;<br>turnout in five of the six States originally covered by §5,&para;<br>with a gap in the sixth State of less than one half of one&para;<br>percent. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, Reported Voting and Registration, by Sex, Race and Hispanic Origin, for States (Nov. 2012) (Table 4b).&para;<br>At the same time, voting discrimination still exists; no&para;<br>one doubts that. The question is whether the Act’s extraordinary measures, including its disparate treatment of&para;<br>the States, continue to satisfy constitutional requirements.&para;<br>As we put it a short time ago, “the Act imposes current&para;<br>burdens and must be justified by current needs.” Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 203.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, in the&para;<br>wake of the Civil War. It provides that “[t]he right of&para;<br>citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or&para;<br>abridged by the United States or by any State on account&para;<br>of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,” and it&para;<br>gives Congress the “power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.”&para;<br>“The first century of congressional enforcement of the&para;<br>Amendment, however, can only be regarded as a failure.”&para;<br>Id., at 197. In the 1890s, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia&para;<br>began to enact literacy tests for voter registration and&para;<br>to employ other methods designed to prevent AfricanAmericans from voting. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 310.&para;<br>Congress passed statutes outlawing some of these practices&para;<br>and facilitating litigation against them, but litigation&para;<br>remained slow and expensive, and the States came up with&para;<br>new ways to discriminate as soon as existing ones were&para;<br>struck down. Voter registration of African-Americans&para;<br>barely improved. Id., at 313–314.&para;<br>Inspired to action by the civil rights movement, Congress responded in 1965 with the Voting Rights Act.&para;<br>Section 2 was enacted to forbid, in all 50 States, any&para;<br>“standard, practice, or procedure . . . imposed or applied&para;<br>. . . to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United&para;<br>States to vote on account of race or color.” 79 Stat. 437.&para;<br>The current version forbids any “standard, practice, or&para;<br>procedure” that “results in a denial or abridgement of the&para;<br>right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account&para;<br>of race or color.” 42 U. S. C. §1973(a). Both the Federal&para;<br>Government and individuals have sued to enforce §2, see,&para;<br>e.g., Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997 (1994), and&para;<br>injunctive relief is available in appropriate cases to block&para;<br>voting laws from going into effect, see 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1973j(d). Section 2 is permanent, applies nationwide,&para;<br>and is not at issue in this case.&para;<br>Other sections targeted only some parts of the country.&para;<br>At the time of the Act’s passage, these “covered” jurisdictions were those States or political subdivisions that had&para;<br>maintained a test or device as a prerequisite to voting as&para;<br>of November 1, 1964, and had less than 50 percent voter&para;<br>registration or turnout in the 1964 Presidential election.&para;<br>§4(b), 79 Stat. 438. Such tests or devices included literacy&para;<br>and knowledge tests, good moral character requirements,&para;<br>the need for vouchers from registered voters, and the like.&para;<br>§4(c), id., at 438–439. A covered jurisdiction could “bail&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>out” of coverage if it had not used a test or device in the&para;<br>preceding five years “for the purpose or with the effect of&para;<br>denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or&para;<br>color.” §4(a), id., at 438. In 1965, the covered States&para;<br>included Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South&para;<br>Carolina, and Virginia. The additional covered subdivisions included 39 counties in North Carolina and one in&para;<br>Arizona. See 28 CFR pt. 51, App. (2012).&para;<br>In those jurisdictions, §4 of the Act banned all such tests&para;<br>or devices. §4(a), 79 Stat. 438. Section 5 provided that no&para;<br>change in voting procedures could take effect until it was&para;<br>approved by federal authorities in Washington, D. C.—&para;<br>either the Attorney General or a court of three judges. Id.,&para;<br>at 439. A jurisdiction could obtain such “preclearance”&para;<br>only by proving that the change had neither “the purpose&para;<br>[nor] the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on&para;<br>account of race or color.” Ibid.&para;<br>Sections 4 and 5 were intended to be temporary; they&para;<br>were set to expire after five years. See §4(a), id., at 438;&para;<br>Northwest Austin, supra, at 199. In South Carolina v.&para;<br>Katzenbach, we upheld the 1965 Act against constitutional&para;<br>challenge, explaining that it was justified to address “voting discrimination where it persists on a pervasive scale.”&para;<br>383 U. S., at 308.&para;<br>In 1970, Congress reauthorized the Act for another five&para;<br>years, and extended the coverage formula in §4(b) to jurisdictions that had a voting test and less than 50 percent&para;<br>voter registration or turnout as of 1968. Voting Rights Act&para;<br>Amendments of 1970, §§3–4, 84 Stat. 315. That swept in&para;<br>several counties in California, New Hampshire, and New&para;<br>York. See 28 CFR pt. 51, App. Congress also extended&para;<br>the ban in §4(a) on tests and devices nationwide. §6, 84&para;<br>Stat. 315.&para;<br>In 1975, Congress reauthorized the Act for seven more&para;<br>years, and extended its coverage to jurisdictions that had&para;<br>a voting test and less than 50 percent voter registration or&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

Congress also amended the definition of “test or device” to include the practice&para;<br>of providing English-only voting materials in places where&para;<br>over five percent of voting-age citizens spoke a single&para;<br>language other than English. §203, id., at 401–402. As a&para;<br>result of these amendments, the States of Alaska, Arizona,&para;<br>and Texas, as well as several counties in California, Florida, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and South Dakota, became covered jurisdictions. See 28 CFR pt. 51, App.&para;<br>Congress correspondingly amended sections 2 and 5 to&para;<br>forbid voting discrimination on the basis of membership in&para;<br>a language minority group, in addition to discrimination&para;<br>on the basis of race or color. §§203, 206, 89 Stat. 401, 402.&para;<br>Finally, Congress made the nationwide ban on tests and&para;<br>devices permanent. §102, id., at 400.&para;<br>In 1982, Congress reauthorized the Act for 25 years, but&para;<br>did not alter its coverage formula. See Voting Rights Act&para;<br>Amendments, 96 Stat. 131. Congress did, however, amend&para;<br>the bailout provisions, allowing political subdivisions of&para;<br>covered jurisdictions to bail out. Among other prerequisites for bailout, jurisdictions and their subdivisions must&para;<br>not have used a forbidden test or device, failed to receive&para;<br>preclearance, or lost a §2 suit, in the ten years prior to&para;<br>seeking bailout. §2, id., at 131–133.&para;<br>We upheld each of these reauthorizations against constitutional challenge. See Georgia v. United States, 411&para;<br>U. S. 526 (1973); City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S.&para;<br>156 (1980); Lopez v. Monterey County, 525 U. S. 266&para;<br>(1999).&para;<br>In 2006, Congress again reauthorized the Voting Rights&para;<br>Act for 25 years, again without change to its coverage&para;<br>formula. Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta&para;<br>Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act, 120 Stat. 577. Congress also amended §5 to&para;<br>prohibit more conduct than before. §5, id., at 580–&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>581; see Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 528 U. S. 320,&para;<br>341 (2000) (Bossier II); Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461,&para;<br>479 (2003). Section 5 now forbids voting changes with&para;<br>“any discriminatory purpose” as well as voting changes&para;<br>that diminish the ability of citizens, on account of race,&para;<br>color, or language minority status, “to elect their preferred&para;<br>candidates of choice.” 42 U. S. C. §§1973c(b)–(d).&para;<br>Shortly after this reauthorization, a Texas utility district&para;<br>brought suit, seeking to bail out from the Act’s coverage and, in the alternative, challenging the Act’s constitutionality. See Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 200–201. A&para;<br>three-judge District Court explained that only a State or&para;<br>political subdivision was eligible to seek bailout under the&para;<br>statute, and concluded that the utility district was not a&para;<br>political subdivision, a term that encompassed only “counties, parishes, and voter-registering subunits.” Northwest&para;<br>Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Mukasey, 573&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 221, 232 (DC 2008). The District Court also&para;<br>rejected the constitutional challenge. Id., at 283.&para;<br>We reversed. We explained that “ ‘normally the Court&para;<br>will not decide a constitutional question if there is some&para;<br>other ground upon which to dispose of the case.’ ” Northwest Austin, supra, at 205 (quoting Escambia County v.&para;<br>McMillan, 466 U. S. 48, 51 (1984) (per curiam)). Concluding that “underlying constitutional concerns,” among other&para;<br>things, “compel[led] a broader reading of the bailout provision,” we construed the statute to allow the utility district&para;<br>to seek bailout. Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 207. In&para;<br>doing so we expressed serious doubts about the Act’s continued constitutionality.&para;<br>We explained that §5 “imposes substantial federalism&para;<br>costs” and “differentiates between the States, despite our historic tradition that all the States enjoy equal sovereignty.”&para;<br>Id., at 202, 203 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>We also noted that “[t]hings have changed in the South.&para;<br>Voter turnout and registration rates now approach parity.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

And minority candidates hold office at unprecedented levels.” Id., at 202. Finally, we questioned whether&para;<br>the problems that §5 meant to address were still “concentrated in the jurisdictions singled out for preclearance.”&para;<br>Id., at 203.&para;<br>Eight Members of the Court subscribed to these views,&para;<br>and the remaining Member would have held the Act unconstitutional. Ultimately, however, the Court’s construction of the bailout provision left the constitutional issues&para;<br>for another day.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Shelby County is located in Alabama, a covered jurisdiction. It has not sought bailout, as the Attorney General&para;<br>has recently objected to voting changes proposed from&para;<br>within the county. See App. 87a–92a. Instead, in 2010,&para;<br>the county sued the Attorney General in Federal District&para;<br>Court in Washington, D. C., seeking a declaratory judgment that sections 4(b) and 5 of the Voting Rights Act are&para;<br>facially unconstitutional, as well as a permanent injunction against their enforcement. The District Court ruled&para;<br>against the county and upheld the Act. 811 F. Supp. 2d&para;<br>424, 508 (2011). The court found that the evidence before&para;<br>Congress in 2006 was sufficient to justify reauthorizing §5&para;<br>and continuing the §4(b) coverage formula.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit affirmed. In&para;<br>assessing §5, the D. C. Circuit considered six primary&para;<br>categories of evidence: Attorney General objections to&para;<br>voting changes, Attorney General requests for more information regarding voting changes, successful §2 suits in&para;<br>covered jurisdictions, the dispatching of federal observers&para;<br>to monitor elections in covered jurisdictions, §5 preclearance suits involving covered jurisdictions, and the deterrent effect of §5. See 679 F. 3d 848, 862–863 (2012). After&para;<br>extensive analysis of the record, the court accepted Con-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>gress’s conclusion that §2 litigation remained inadequate&para;<br>in the covered jurisdictions to protect the rights of minority voters, and that §5 was therefore still necessary. Id.,&para;<br>at 873.&para;<br>Turning to §4, the D. C. Circuit noted that the evidence&para;<br>for singling out the covered jurisdictions was “less robust”&para;<br>and that the issue presented “a close question.” Id., at&para;<br>879. But the court looked to data comparing the number&para;<br>of successful §2 suits in the different parts of the country.&para;<br>Coupling that evidence with the deterrent effect of §5, the&para;<br>court concluded that the statute continued “to single out&para;<br>the jurisdictions in which discrimination is concentrated,”&para;<br>and thus held that the coverage formula passed constitutional muster. Id., at 883.&para;<br>Judge Williams dissented. He found “no positive correlation between inclusion in §4(b)’s coverage formula and&para;<br>low black registration or turnout.” Id., at 891. Rather,&para;<br>to the extent there was any correlation, it actually went&para;<br>the other way: “condemnation under §4(b) is a marker of&para;<br>higher black registration and turnout.” Ibid. (emphasis&para;<br>added). Judge Williams also found that “[c]overed jurisdictions have far more black officeholders as a proportion&para;<br>of the black population than do uncovered ones.” Id., at&para;<br>892. As to the evidence of successful §2 suits, Judge Williams disaggregated the reported cases by State, and&para;<br>concluded that “[t]he five worst uncovered jurisdictions . . .&para;<br>have worse records than eight of the covered jurisdictions.” Id., at 897. He also noted that two covered jurisdictions—Arizona and Alaska—had not had any successful&para;<br>reported §2 suit brought against them during the entire 24&para;<br>years covered by the data. Ibid. Judge Williams would&para;<br>have held the coverage formula of §4(b) “irrational” and&para;<br>unconstitutional. Id., at 885.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 568 U.

Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.&para;<br>State legislation may not contravene federal law. The&para;<br>Federal Government does not, however, have a general&para;<br>right to review and veto state enactments before they go&para;<br>into effect. A proposal to grant such authority to “negative” state laws was considered at the Constitutional&para;<br>Convention, but rejected in favor of allowing state laws to&para;<br>take effect, subject to later challenge under the Supremacy&para;<br>Clause.

Farrand ed. 1911); 2 id., at 27–29,&para;<br>390–392.&para;<br>Outside the strictures of the Supremacy Clause, States&para;<br>retain broad autonomy in structuring their governments&para;<br>and pursuing legislative objectives. Indeed, the Constitution provides that all powers not specifically granted to the&para;<br>Federal Government are reserved to the States or citizens.&para;<br>Amdt. 10. This “allocation of powers in our federal system&para;<br>preserves the integrity, dignity, and residual sovereignty&para;<br>of the States.” Bond v. United States, 564 U.

Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 461–462 (1991) (quoting Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U. S. 634, 647 (1973); some&para;<br>internal quotation marks omitted). Of course, the Federal&para;<br>Government retains significant control over federal elections. For instance, the Constitution authorizes Congress&para;<br>to establish the time and manner for electing Senators and&para;<br>Representatives. Art. I, §4, cl. 1; see also Arizona v.

Northwest Austin, supra,&para;<br>at 203 (citing United States v. Louisiana, 363 U. S. 1, 16&para;<br>(1960); Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 223 (1845);&para;<br>and Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725–726 (1869); emphasis&para;<br>added). Over a hundred years ago, this Court explained&para;<br>that our Nation “was and is a union of States, equal in&para;<br>power, dignity and authority.” Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S.&para;<br>559, 567 (1911). Indeed, “the constitutional equality of the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>States is essential to the harmonious operation of the&para;<br>scheme upon which the Republic was organized.” Id., at&para;<br>580. Coyle concerned the admission of new States, and&para;<br>Katzenbach rejected the notion that the principle operated&para;<br>as a bar on differential treatment outside that context.&para;<br>383 U. S., at 328–329. At the same time, as we made clear&para;<br>in Northwest Austin, the fundamental principle of equal&para;<br>sovereignty remains highly pertinent in assessing subsequent disparate treatment of States. 557 U. S., at 203.&para;<br>The Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic&para;<br>principles. It suspends “all changes to state election law—&para;<br>however innocuous—until they have been precleared&para;<br>by federal authorities in Washington, D. C.” Id., at 202.&para;<br>States must beseech the Federal Government for permission to implement laws that they would otherwise have&para;<br>the right to enact and execute on their own, subject of&para;<br>course to any injunction in a §2 action. The Attorney&para;<br>General has 60 days to object to a preclearance request,&para;<br>longer if he requests more information. See 28 CFR&para;<br>§§51.9, 51.37. If a State seeks preclearance from a threejudge court, the process can take years.&para;<br>And despite the tradition of equal sovereignty, the Act&para;<br>applies to only nine States (and several additional counties). While one State waits months or years and expends&para;<br>funds to implement a validly enacted law, its neighbor&para;<br>can typically put the same law into effect immediately,&para;<br>through the normal legislative process. Even if a noncovered jurisdiction is sued, there are important differences&para;<br>between those proceedings and preclearance proceedings;&para;<br>the preclearance proceeding “not only switches the burden&para;<br>of proof to the supplicant jurisdiction, but also applies&para;<br>substantive standards quite different from those governing the rest of the nation.” 679 F. 3d, at 884 (Williams, J.,&para;<br>dissenting) (case below).&para;<br>All this explains why, when we first upheld the Act in&para;<br>1966, we described it as “stringent” and “potent.” Katzen-&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>bach, 383 U. S., at 308, 315, 337. We recognized that it&para;<br>“may have been an uncommon exercise of congressional&para;<br>power,” but concluded that “legislative measures not otherwise appropriate” could be justified by “exceptional conditions.” Id., at 334. We have since noted that the Act&para;<br>“authorizes federal intrusion into sensitive areas of state&para;<br>and local policymaking,” Lopez, 525 U. S., at 282, and&para;<br>represents an “extraordinary departure from the traditional course of relations between the States and the&para;<br>Federal Government,” Presley v. Etowah County Comm’n,&para;<br>502 U. S. 491, 500–501 (1992). As we reiterated in&para;<br>Northwest Austin, the Act constitutes “extraordinary&para;<br>legislation otherwise unfamiliar to our federal system.”&para;<br>557 U. S., at 211.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In 1966, we found these departures from the basic features of our system of government justified. The “blight of&para;<br>racial discrimination in voting” had “infected the electoral&para;<br>process in parts of our country for nearly a century.”&para;<br>Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 308. Several States had enacted&para;<br>a variety of requirements and tests “specifically designed&para;<br>to prevent” African-Americans from voting. Id., at 310.&para;<br>Case-by-case litigation had proved inadequate to prevent&para;<br>such racial discrimination in voting, in part because&para;<br>States “merely switched to discriminatory devices not&para;<br>covered by the federal decrees,” “enacted difficult new&para;<br>tests,” or simply “defied and evaded court orders.” Id., at&para;<br>314. Shortly before enactment of the Voting Rights Act,&para;<br>only 19.4 percent of African-Americans of voting age were&para;<br>registered to vote in Alabama, only 31.8 percent in Louisiana, and only 6.4 percent in Mississippi. Id., at 313.&para;<br>Those figures were roughly 50 percentage points or more&para;<br>below the figures for whites. Ibid.&para;<br>In short, we concluded that “[u]nder the compulsion of&para;<br>these unique circumstances, Congress responded in a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>permissibly decisive manner.” Id., at 334, 335. We also&para;<br>noted then and have emphasized since that this extraordinary legislation was intended to be temporary, set to&para;<br>expire after five years. Id., at 333; Northwest Austin,&para;<br>supra, at 199.&para;<br>At the time, the coverage formula—the means of linking&para;<br>the exercise of the unprecedented authority with the&para;<br>problem that warranted it—made sense. We found that&para;<br>“Congress chose to limit its attention to the geographic&para;<br>areas where immediate action seemed necessary.” Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 328. The areas where Congress&para;<br>found “evidence of actual voting discrimination” shared&para;<br>two characteristics: “the use of tests and devices for voter&para;<br>registration, and a voting rate in the 1964 presidential&para;<br>election at least 12 points below the national average.”&para;<br>Id., at 330. We explained that “[t]ests and devices are&para;<br>relevant to voting discrimination because of their long&para;<br>history as a tool for perpetrating the evil; a low voting rate&para;<br>is pertinent for the obvious reason that widespread disenfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of actual&para;<br>voters.” Ibid. We therefore concluded that “the coverage&para;<br>formula [was] rational in both practice and theory.” Ibid.&para;<br>It accurately reflected those jurisdictions uniquely characterized by voting discrimination “on a pervasive scale,”&para;<br>linking coverage to the devices used to effectuate discrimination and to the resulting disenfranchisement. Id., at&para;<br>308. The formula ensured that the “stringent remedies&para;<br>[were] aimed at areas where voting discrimination ha[d]&para;<br>been most flagrant.” Id., at 315.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically. Shelby County contends that the preclearance requirement, even without regard to its disparate coverage,&para;<br>is now unconstitutional. Its arguments have a good deal&para;<br>of force. In the covered jurisdictions, “[v]oter turnout and&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>registration rates now approach parity. Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority&para;<br>candidates hold office at unprecedented levels.” Northwest&para;<br>Austin, 557 U. S., at 202. The tests and devices that&para;<br>blocked access to the ballot have been forbidden nationwide for over 40 years. See §6, 84 Stat. 315; §102, 89 Stat.&para;<br>400.&para;<br>Those conclusions are not ours alone. Congress said the&para;<br>same when it reauthorized the Act in 2006, writing that&para;<br>“[s]ignificant progress has been made in eliminating first&para;<br>generation barriers experienced by minority voters, including increased numbers of registered minority voters,&para;<br>minority voter turnout, and minority representation in&para;<br>Congress, State legislatures, and local elected offices.”&para;<br>§2(b)(1), 120 Stat. 577. The House Report elaborated that&para;<br>“the number of African-Americans who are registered and&para;<br>who turn out to cast ballots has increased significantly&para;<br>over the last 40 years, particularly since 1982,” and noted&para;<br>that “[i]n some circumstances, minorities register to vote&para;<br>and cast ballots at levels that surpass those of white voters.” H. R. Rep. No. 109–478, p. 12 (2006). That Report&para;<br>also explained that there have been “significant increases&para;<br>in the number of African-Americans serving in elected&para;<br>offices”; more specifically, there has been approximately&para;<br>a 1,000 percent increase since 1965 in the number of&para;<br>African-American elected officials in the six States originally covered by the Voting Rights Act. Id., at 18.&para;<br>The following chart, compiled from the Senate and&para;<br>House Reports, compares voter registration numbers from&para;<br>1965 to those from 2004 in the six originally covered&para;<br>States.

Rep. No. 109–295, p. 11 (2006); H. R. Rep. No. 109–&para;<br>478, at 12. The 2004 figures come from the Census Bureau. Census Bureau data from the most recent election&para;<br>indicate that African-American voter turnout exceeded&para;<br>white voter turnout in five of the six States originally&para;<br>covered by §5, with a gap in the sixth State of less than&para;<br>one half of one percent. See Dept. of Commerce, Census&para;<br>Bureau, Reported Voting and Registration, by Sex, Race&para;<br>and Hispanic Origin, for States (Table 4b). The preclearance statistics are also illuminating. In the first decade&para;<br>after enactment of §5, the Attorney General objected to&para;<br>14.2 percent of proposed voting changes. H. R Rep. No.&para;<br>109–478, at 22. In the last decade before reenactment, the&para;<br>Attorney General objected to a mere 0.16 percent. S. Rep.&para;<br>No. 109–295, at 13.&para;<br>There is no doubt that these improvements are in large&para;<br>part because of the Voting Rights Act. The Act has proved&para;<br>immensely successful at redressing racial discrimination&para;<br>and integrating the voting process. See §2(b)(1), 120 Stat.&para;<br>577. During the “Freedom Summer” of 1964, in Philadelphia, Mississippi, three men were murdered while working in the area to register African-American voters. See&para;<br>United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 790 (1966). On&para;<br>“Bloody Sunday” in 1965, in Selma, Alabama, police beat&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v.

See Northwest&para;<br>Austin, supra, at 220, n. 3 (THOMAS, J., concurring in&para;<br>judgment in part and dissenting in part). Today both of&para;<br>those towns are governed by African-American mayors.&para;<br>Problems remain in these States and others, but there is&para;<br>no denying that, due to the Voting Rights Act, our Nation&para;<br>has made great strides.&para;<br>Yet the Act has not eased the restrictions in §5 or narrowed the scope of the coverage formula in §4(b) along the&para;<br>way. Those extraordinary and unprecedented features&para;<br>were reauthorized—as if nothing had changed. In fact,&para;<br>the Act’s unusual remedies have grown even stronger.&para;<br>When Congress reauthorized the Act in 2006, it did so for&para;<br>another 25 years on top of the previous 40—a far cry from&para;<br>the initial five-year period. See 42 U. S. C. §1973b(a)(8).&para;<br>Congress also expanded the prohibitions in §5. We had&para;<br>previously interpreted §5 to prohibit only those redistricting plans that would have the purpose or effect of worsening the position of minority groups. See Bossier II, 528&para;<br>U. S., at 324, 335–336. In 2006, Congress amended §5&para;<br>to prohibit laws that could have favored such groups but&para;<br>did not do so because of a discriminatory purpose, see 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §1973c(c), even though we had stated that such&para;<br>broadening of §5 coverage would “exacerbate the substantial federalism costs that the preclearance procedure&para;<br>already exacts, perhaps to the extent of raising concerns&para;<br>about §5’s constitutionality,” Bossier II, supra, at 336&para;<br>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, Congress expanded §5 to prohibit any voting law&para;<br>“that has the purpose of or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States,” on&para;<br>account of race, color, or language minority status, “to&para;<br>elect their preferred candidates of choice.” §1973c(b). In&para;<br>light of those two amendments, the bar that covered jurisdictions must clear has been raised even as the conditions&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>justifying that requirement have dramatically improved.&para;<br>We have also previously highlighted the concern that&para;<br>“the preclearance requirements in one State [might]&para;<br>be unconstitutional in another.” Northwest Austin, 557&para;<br>U. S., at 203; see Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S., at 491&para;<br>(KENNEDY, J., concurring) (“considerations of race that&para;<br>would doom a redistricting plan under the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment or §2 [of the Voting Rights Act] seem to be&para;<br>what save it under §5”). Nothing has happened since to&para;<br>alleviate this troubling concern about the current application of §5.&para;<br>Respondents do not deny that there have been improvements on the ground, but argue that much of this&para;<br>can be attributed to the deterrent effect of §5, which dissuades covered jurisdictions from engaging in discrimination that they would resume should §5 be struck down.&para;<br>Under this theory, however, §5 would be effectively immune from scrutiny; no matter how “clean” the record&para;<br>of covered jurisdictions, the argument could always be&para;<br>made that it was deterrence that accounted for the good&para;<br>behavior.&para;<br>The provisions of §5 apply only to those jurisdictions&para;<br>singled out by §4. We now consider whether that coverage&para;<br>formula is constitutional in light of current conditions.&para;<br>III&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>When upholding the constitutionality of the coverage&para;<br>formula in 1966, we concluded that it was “rational in both&para;<br>practice and theory.” Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 330. The&para;<br>formula looked to cause (discriminatory tests) and effect (low voter registration and turnout), and tailored the&para;<br>remedy (preclearance) to those jurisdictions exhibiting&para;<br>both.&para;<br>By 2009, however, we concluded that the “coverage&para;<br>formula raise[d] serious constitutional questions.” North-&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>west Austin, 557 U. S., at 204. As we explained, a statute’s “current burdens” must be justified by “current&para;<br>needs,” and any “disparate geographic coverage” must be&para;<br>“sufficiently related to the problem that it targets.” Id., at&para;<br>203. The coverage formula met that test in 1965, but no&para;<br>longer does so.&para;<br>Coverage today is based on decades-old data and eradicated practices. The formula captures States by reference&para;<br>to literacy tests and low voter registration and turnout in&para;<br>the 1960s and early 1970s. But such tests have been&para;<br>banned nationwide for over 40 years. §6, 84 Stat. 315;&para;<br>§102, 89 Stat. 400. And voter registration and turnout&para;<br>numbers in the covered States have risen dramatically in&para;<br>the years since. H. R. Rep. No. 109–478, at 12. Racial&para;<br>disparity in those numbers was compelling evidence justifying the preclearance remedy and the coverage formula.&para;<br>See, e.g., Katzenbach, supra, at 313, 329–330. There is no&para;<br>longer such a disparity.&para;<br>In 1965, the States could be divided into two groups:&para;<br>those with a recent history of voting tests and low voter&para;<br>registration and turnout, and those without those characteristics. Congress based its coverage formula on that&para;<br>distinction. Today the Nation is no longer divided along&para;<br>those lines, yet the Voting Rights Act continues to treat it&para;<br>as if it were.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Government’s defense of the formula is limited.&para;<br>First, the Government contends that the formula is “reverse-engineered”: Congress identified the jurisdictions to&para;<br>be covered and then came up with criteria to describe&para;<br>them. Brief for Federal Respondent 48–49. Under that&para;<br>reasoning, there need not be any logical relationship between the criteria in the formula and the reason for&para;<br>coverage; all that is necessary is that the formula happen&para;<br>to capture the jurisdictions Congress wanted to single out.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The Government suggests that Katzenbach sanctioned&para;<br>such an approach, but the analysis in Katzenbach was&para;<br>quite different. Katzenbach reasoned that the coverage&para;<br>formula was rational because the “formula . . . was relevant to the problem”: “Tests and devices are relevant to&para;<br>voting discrimination because of their long history as a&para;<br>tool for perpetrating the evil; a low voting rate is pertinent&para;<br>for the obvious reason that widespread disenfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of actual voters.”&para;<br>383 U. S., at 329, 330.&para;<br>Here, by contrast, the Government’s reverseengineering argument does not even attempt to demonstrate the continued relevance of the formula to the problem&para;<br>it targets. And in the context of a decision as significant&para;<br>as this one—subjecting a disfavored subset of States&para;<br>to “extraordinary legislation otherwise unfamiliar to our&para;<br>federal system,” Northwest Austin, supra, at 211—that&para;<br>failure to establish even relevance is fatal.&para;<br>The Government falls back to the argument that because the formula was relevant in 1965, its continued use&para;<br>is permissible so long as any discrimination remains in the&para;<br>States Congress identified back then—regardless of how&para;<br>that discrimination compares to discrimination in States&para;<br>unburdened by coverage. Brief for Federal Respondent&para;<br>49–50. This argument does not look to “current political&para;<br>conditions,” Northwest Austin, supra, at 203, but instead&para;<br>relies on a comparison between the States in 1965. That&para;<br>comparison reflected the different histories of the North&para;<br>and South. It was in the South that slavery was upheld by&para;<br>law until uprooted by the Civil War, that the reign of Jim&para;<br>Crow denied African-Americans the most basic freedoms,&para;<br>and that state and local governments worked tirelessly to&para;<br>disenfranchise citizens on the basis of race. The Court&para;<br>invoked that history—rightly so—in sustaining the disparate coverage of the Voting Rights Act in 1966. See&para;<br>Katzenbach, supra, at 308 (“The constitutional propriety of&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the Voting Rights Act of 1965 must be judged with reference to the historical experience which it reflects.”).&para;<br>But history did not end in 1965. By the time the Act&para;<br>was reauthorized in 2006, there had been 40 more years of&para;<br>it. In assessing the “current need[ ]” for a preclearance&para;<br>system that treats States differently from one another&para;<br>today, that history cannot be ignored. During that time,&para;<br>largely because of the Voting Rights Act, voting tests were&para;<br>abolished, disparities in voter registration and turnout&para;<br>due to race were erased, and African-Americans attained&para;<br>political office in record numbers. And yet the coverage&para;<br>formula that Congress reauthorized in 2006 ignores these&para;<br>developments, keeping the focus on decades-old data relevant to decades-old problems, rather than current data&para;<br>reflecting current needs.&para;<br>The Fifteenth Amendment commands that the right to&para;<br>vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race or&para;<br>color, and it gives Congress the power to enforce that&para;<br>command. The Amendment is not designed to punish for&para;<br>the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future. See Rice&para;<br>v. Cayetano, 528 U. S. 495, 512 (2000) (“Consistent with&para;<br>the design of the Constitution, the [Fifteenth] Amendment&para;<br>is cast in fundamental terms, terms transcending the&para;<br>particular controversy which was the immediate impetus&para;<br>for its enactment.”). To serve that purpose, Congress—if it&para;<br>is to divide the States—must identify those jurisdictions to&para;<br>be singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of&para;<br>current conditions. It cannot rely simply on the past. We&para;<br>made that clear in Northwest Austin, and we make it clear&para;<br>again today.&para;<br>C&para;<br>In defending the coverage formula, the Government, the&para;<br>intervenors, and the dissent also rely heavily on data from&para;<br>the record that they claim justify disparate coverage.&para;<br>Congress compiled thousands of pages of evidence before&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act. The court below and&para;<br>the parties have debated what that record shows—they&para;<br>have gone back and forth about whether to compare covered to noncovered jurisdictions as blocks, how to disaggregate the data State by State, how to weigh §2 cases&para;<br>as evidence of ongoing discrimination, and whether to&para;<br>consider evidence not before Congress, among other issues. Compare, e.g., 679 F. 3d, at 873–883 (case below),&para;<br>with id., at 889–902 (Williams, J., dissenting). Regardless&para;<br>of how to look at the record, however, no one can fairly say&para;<br>that it shows anything approaching the “pervasive,” “flagrant,” “widespread,” and “rampant” discrimination that&para;<br>faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the&para;<br>covered jurisdictions from the rest of the Nation at that&para;<br>time. Katzenbach, supra, at 308, 315, 331; Northwest&para;<br>Austin, 557 U. S., at 201.&para;<br>But a more fundamental problem remains: Congress did&para;<br>not use the record it compiled to shape a coverage formula&para;<br>grounded in current conditions. It instead reenacted a&para;<br>formula based on 40-year-old facts having no logical relation to the present day. The dissent relies on “secondgeneration barriers,” which are not impediments to the&para;<br>casting of ballots, but rather electoral arrangements that&para;<br>affect the weight of minority votes. That does not cure the&para;<br>problem. Viewing the preclearance requirements as targeting such efforts simply highlights the irrationality of&para;<br>continued reliance on the §4 coverage formula, which is&para;<br>based on voting tests and access to the ballot, not vote&para;<br>dilution. We cannot pretend that we are reviewing an&para;<br>updated statute, or try our hand at updating the statute&para;<br>ourselves, based on the new record compiled by Congress.&para;<br>Contrary to the dissent’s contention, see post, at 23, we are&para;<br>not ignoring the record; we are simply recognizing that it&para;<br>played no role in shaping the statutory formula before us&para;<br>today.&para;<br>The dissent also turns to the record to argue that, in&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>light of voting discrimination in Shelby County, the county&para;<br>cannot complain about the provisions that subject it to&para;<br>preclearance. Post, at 23–30. But that is like saying that&para;<br>a driver pulled over pursuant to a policy of stopping all&para;<br>redheads cannot complain about that policy, if it turns out&para;<br>his license has expired. Shelby County’s claim is that the&para;<br>coverage formula here is unconstitutional in all its applications, because of how it selects the jurisdictions subjected to preclearance. The county was selected based on&para;<br>that formula, and may challenge it in court.&para;<br>D&para;<br>The dissent proceeds from a flawed premise. It quotes&para;<br>the famous sentence from McCulloch v. Maryland, 4&para;<br>Wheat. 316, 421 (1819), with the following emphasis: “Let&para;<br>the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the&para;<br>constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which&para;<br>are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited,&para;<br>but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution,&para;<br>are constitutional.” Post, at 9 (emphasis in dissent). But&para;<br>this case is about a part of the sentence that the dissent&para;<br>does not emphasize—the part that asks whether a legislative means is “consist[ent] with the letter and spirit of the&para;<br>constitution.” The dissent states that “[i]t cannot tenably&para;<br>be maintained” that this is an issue with regard to the&para;<br>Voting Rights Act, post, at 9, but four years ago, in an&para;<br>opinion joined by two of today’s dissenters, the Court&para;<br>expressly stated that “[t]he Act’s preclearance requirement and its coverage formula raise serious constitutional&para;<br>questions.” Northwest Austin, supra, at 204. The dissent&para;<br>does not explain how those “serious constitutional questions” became untenable in four short years.&para;<br>The dissent treats the Act as if it were just like any&para;<br>other piece of legislation, but this Court has made clear&para;<br>from the beginning that the Voting Rights Act is far from&para;<br>ordinary. At the risk of repetition, Katzenbach indicated&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that the Act was “uncommon” and “not otherwise appropriate,” but was justified by “exceptional” and “unique”&para;<br>conditions. 383 U. S., at 334, 335. Multiple decisions&para;<br>since have reaffirmed the Act’s “extraordinary” nature.&para;<br>See, e.g., Northwest Austin, supra, at 211. Yet the dissent&para;<br>goes so far as to suggest instead that the preclearance&para;<br>requirement and disparate treatment of the States should&para;<br>be upheld into the future “unless there [is] no or almost no&para;<br>evidence of unconstitutional action by States.” Post, at 33.&para;<br>In other ways as well, the dissent analyzes the question presented as if our decision in Northwest Austin never&para;<br>happened. For example, the dissent refuses to consider the principle of equal sovereignty, despite Northwest&para;<br>Austin’s emphasis on its significance. Northwest Austin&para;<br>also emphasized the “dramatic” progress since 1965, 557&para;<br>U. S., at 201, but the dissent describes current levels of&para;<br>discrimination as “flagrant,” “widespread,” and “pervasive,” post, at 7, 17 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Despite the fact that Northwest Austin requires an Act’s&para;<br>“disparate geographic coverage” to be “sufficiently related”&para;<br>to its targeted problems, 557 U. S., at 203, the dissent&para;<br>maintains that an Act’s limited coverage actually eases&para;<br>Congress’s burdens, and suggests that a fortuitous relationship should suffice. Although Northwest Austin stated&para;<br>definitively that “current burdens” must be justified by&para;<br>“current needs,” ibid., the dissent argues that the coverage&para;<br>formula can be justified by history, and that the required&para;<br>showing can be weaker on reenactment than when the law&para;<br>was first passed.&para;<br>There is no valid reason to insulate the coverage formula from review merely because it was previously enacted&para;<br>40 years ago. If Congress had started from scratch in&para;<br>2006, it plainly could not have enacted the present coverage formula. It would have been irrational for Congress to&para;<br>distinguish between States in such a fundamental way&para;<br>based on 40-year-old data, when today’s statistics tell an&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>entirely different story. And it would have been irrational&para;<br>to base coverage on the use of voting tests 40 years ago,&para;<br>when such tests have been illegal since that time. But&para;<br>that is exactly what Congress has done.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Striking down an Act of Congress “is the gravest and&para;<br>most delicate duty that this Court is called on to perform.”&para;<br>Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, J.,&para;<br>concurring). We do not do so lightly. That is why, in 2009,&para;<br>we took care to avoid ruling on the constitutionality of&para;<br>the Voting Rights Act when asked to do so, and instead&para;<br>resolved the case then before us on statutory grounds. But&para;<br>in issuing that decision, we expressed our broader concerns about the constitutionality of the Act. Congress&para;<br>could have updated the coverage formula at that time, but&para;<br>did not do so. Its failure to act leaves us today with no&para;<br>choice but to declare §4(b) unconstitutional. The formula&para;<br>in that section can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance.&para;<br>Our decision in no way affects the permanent, nationwide ban on racial discrimination in voting found in §2.&para;<br>We issue no holding on §5 itself, only on the coverage&para;<br>formula. Congress may draft another formula based on&para;<br>current conditions. Such a formula is an initial prerequisite to a determination that exceptional conditions still&para;<br>exist justifying such an “extraordinary departure from the&para;<br>traditional course of relations between the States and the&para;<br>Federal Government.” Presley, 502 U. S., at 500–501. Our&para;<br>country has changed, and while any racial discrimination&para;<br>in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the&para;<br>legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to&para;<br>current conditions.&para;<br>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

The Court’s opinion sets forth the&para;<br>reasons.&para;<br>“The Voting Rights Act of 1965 employed extraordinary&para;<br>measures to address an extraordinary problem.” Ante, at&para;<br>1. In the face of “unremitting and ingenious defiance” of&para;<br>citizens’ constitutionally protected right to vote, §5 was&para;<br>necessary to give effect to the Fifteenth Amendment in&para;<br>particular regions of the country. South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 309 (1966). Though §5’s preclearance requirement represented a “shar[p] depart[ure]” from&para;<br>“basic principles” of federalism and the equal sovereignty&para;<br>of the States, ante, at 9, 11, the Court upheld the measure&para;<br>against early constitutional challenges because it was&para;<br>necessary at the time to address “voting discrimination&para;<br>where it persist[ed] on a pervasive scale.” Katzenbach,&para;<br>supra, at 308.&para;<br>Today, our Nation has changed. “[T]he conditions that&para;<br>originally justified [§5] no longer characterize voting in the&para;<br>covered jurisdictions.” Ante, at 2. As the Court explains:&para;<br>“ ‘[V]oter turnout and registration rates now approach&para;<br>parity. Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal de-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>crees are rare. And minority candidates hold office at unprecedented levels.’ ” Ante, at 13–14 (quoting Northwest&para;<br>Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U. S.&para;<br>193, 202 (2009)).&para;<br>In spite of these improvements, however, Congress&para;<br>increased the already significant burdens of §5. Following&para;<br>its reenactment in 2006, the Voting Rights Act was&para;<br>amended to “prohibit more conduct than before.” Ante,&para;<br>at 5. “Section 5 now forbids voting changes with ‘any discriminatory purpose’ as well as voting changes that diminish the ability of citizens, on account of race, color, or&para;<br>language minority status, ‘to elect their preferred candidates of choice.’ ” Ante, at 6. While the pre-2006 version of&para;<br>the Act went well beyond protection guaranteed under the&para;<br>Constitution, see Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520&para;<br>U. S. 471, 480–482 (1997), it now goes even further.&para;<br>It is, thus, quite fitting that the Court repeatedly points&para;<br>out that this legislation is “extraordinary” and “unprecedented” and recognizes the significant constitutional&para;<br>problems created by Congress’ decision to raise “the bar&para;<br>that covered jurisdictions must clear,” even as “the conditions justifying that requirement have dramatically improved.” Ante, at 16–17. However one aggregates the&para;<br>data compiled by Congress, it cannot justify the considerable burdens created by §5. As the Court aptly notes:&para;<br>“[N]o one can fairly say that [the record] shows anything&para;<br>approaching the ‘pervasive,’ ‘flagrant,’ ‘widespread,’ and&para;<br>‘rampant’ discrimination that faced Congress in 1965, and&para;<br>that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions from&para;<br>the rest of the Nation at that time.” Ante, at 21. Indeed,&para;<br>circumstances in the covered jurisdictions can no longer be&para;<br>characterized as “exceptional” or “unique.” “The extensive&para;<br>pattern of discrimination that led the Court to previously&para;<br>uphold §5 as enforcing the Fifteenth Amendment no longer&para;<br>exists.” Northwest Austin, supra, at 226 (THOMAS, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

By leaving the&para;<br>inevitable conclusion unstated, the Court needlessly prolongs the demise of that provision.

Congress was of&para;<br>another mind. Recognizing that large progress has been&para;<br>made, Congress determined, based on a voluminous rec­&para;<br>ord, that the scourge of discrimination was not yet extir­&para;<br>pated. The question this case presents is who decides&para;<br>whether, as currently operative, §5 remains justifiable,1&para;<br>this Court, or a Congress charged with the obligation to&para;<br>enforce the post-Civil War Amendments “by appropriate&para;<br>legislation.” With overwhelming support in both Houses,&para;<br>Congress concluded that, for two prime reasons, §5 should&para;<br>continue in force, unabated. First, continuance would&para;<br>facilitate completion of the impressive gains thus far&para;<br>made; and second, continuance would guard against back­&para;<br>sliding. Those assessments were well within Congress’&para;<br>province to make and should elicit this Court’s unstinting&para;<br>approbation.&para;<br>I&para;<br>“[V]oting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that.”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The Court purports to declare unconstitutional only the coverage&para;<br>formula set out in §4(b). See ante, at 24. But without that formula, §5&para;<br>is immobilized.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Ante, at 2. But the Court today terminates the remedy&para;<br>that proved to be best suited to block that discrimination.&para;<br>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) has worked to com­&para;<br>bat voting discrimination where other remedies had been&para;<br>tried and failed. Particularly effective is the VRA’s re­&para;<br>quirement of federal preclearance for all changes to voting&para;<br>laws in the regions of the country with the most aggravated&para;<br>records of rank discrimination against minority voting&para;<br>rights.&para;<br>A century after the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amend­&para;<br>ments guaranteed citizens the right to vote free of dis­&para;<br>crimination on the basis of race, the “blight of racial&para;<br>discrimination in voting” continued to “infec[t] the&para;<br>electoral process in parts of our country.” South Carolina v.&para;<br>Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308 (1966). Early attempts to&para;<br>cope with this vile infection resembled battling the Hydra.&para;<br>Whenever one form of voting discrimination was identified&para;<br>and prohibited, others sprang up in its place. This Court&para;<br>repeatedly encountered the remarkable “variety and&para;<br>persistence” of laws disenfranchising minority citizens.&para;<br>Id., at 311. To take just one example, the Court, in 1927,&para;<br>held unconstitutional a Texas law barring black voters&para;<br>from participating in primary elections, Nixon v. Herndon,&para;<br>273 U. S. 536, 541; in 1944, the Court struck down a&para;<br>“reenacted” and slightly altered version of the same law,&para;<br>Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 658; and in 1953, the&para;<br>Court once again confronted an attempt by Texas to “cir­&para;<br>cumven[t]” the Fifteenth Amendment by adopting yet&para;<br>another variant of the all-white primary, Terry v. Adams,&para;<br>345 U. S. 461, 469.&para;<br>During this era, the Court recognized that discrimina­&para;<br>tion against minority voters was a quintessentially politi­&para;<br>cal problem requiring a political solution. As Justice&para;<br>Holmes explained: If “the great mass of the white popula­&para;<br>tion intends to keep the blacks from voting,” “relief from&para;<br>[that] great political wrong, if done, as alleged, by the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>people of a State and the State itself, must be given by&para;<br>them or by the legislative and political department of&para;<br>the government of the United States.” Giles v. Harris, 189&para;<br>U. S. 475, 488 (1903).&para;<br>Congress learned from experience that laws targeting&para;<br>particular electoral practices or enabling case-by-case&para;<br>litigation were inadequate to the task. In the Civil Rights&para;<br>Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964, Congress authorized and&para;<br>then expanded the power of “the Attorney General to seek&para;<br>injunctions against public and private interference with&para;<br>the right to vote on racial grounds.” Katzenbach, 383&para;<br>U. S., at 313. But circumstances reduced the ameliorative&para;<br>potential of these legislative Acts:&para;<br>“Voting suits are unusually onerous to prepare, some­&para;<br>times requiring as many as 6,000 man-hours spent&para;<br>combing through registration records in preparation&para;<br>for trial. Litigation has been exceedingly slow, in part&para;<br>because of the ample opportunities for delay afforded&para;<br>voting officials and others involved in the proceed­&para;<br>ings. Even when favorable decisions have finally been&para;<br>obtained, some of the States affected have merely&para;<br>switched to discriminatory devices not covered by the&para;<br>federal decrees or have enacted difficult new tests de­&para;<br>signed to prolong the existing disparity between white&para;<br>and Negro registration. Alternatively, certain local of­&para;<br>ficials have defied and evaded court orders or have&para;<br>simply closed their registration offices to freeze the&para;<br>voting rolls.” Id., at 314 (footnote omitted).&para;<br>Patently, a new approach was needed.&para;<br>Answering that need, the Voting Rights Act became one&para;<br>of the most consequential, efficacious, and amply justified&para;<br>exercises of federal legislative power in our Nation’s his­&para;<br>tory. Requiring federal preclearance of changes in voting&para;<br>laws in the covered jurisdictions—those States and locali­&para;<br>ties where opposition to the Constitution’s commands were&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>most virulent—the VRA provided a fit solution for minor­&para;<br>ity voters as well as for States. Under the preclearance&para;<br>regime established by §5 of the VRA, covered jurisdictions&para;<br>must submit proposed changes in voting laws or proce­&para;<br>dures to the Department of Justice (DOJ), which has 60&para;<br>days to respond to the changes. 79 Stat. 439, codified at&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §1973c(a). A change will be approved unless&para;<br>DOJ finds it has “the purpose [or] . . . the effect of denying&para;<br>or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.”&para;<br>Ibid. In the alternative, the covered jurisdiction may seek&para;<br>approval by a three-judge District Court in the District of&para;<br>Columbia.&para;<br>After a century’s failure to fulfill the promise of the&para;<br>Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, passage of the&para;<br>VRA finally led to signal improvement on this front. “The&para;<br>Justice Department estimated that in the five years after&para;<br>[the VRA’s] passage, almost as many blacks registered [to&para;<br>vote] in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, North&para;<br>Carolina, and South Carolina as in the entire century&para;<br>before 1965.” Davidson, The Voting Rights Act: A Brief&para;<br>History, in Controversies in Minority Voting 7, 21 (B.&para;<br>Grofman &amp; C. Davidson eds. 1992). And in assessing the&para;<br>overall effects of the VRA in 2006, Congress found that&para;<br>“[s]ignificant progress has been made in eliminating first&para;<br>generation barriers experienced by minority voters, in­&para;<br>cluding increased numbers of registered minority voters,&para;<br>minority voter turnout, and minority representation in&para;<br>Congress, State legislatures, and local elected offices.

City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 181&para;<br>(1980). Congress also found that as “registration and&para;<br>voting of minority citizens increas[ed], other measures&para;<br>may be resorted to which would dilute increasing minority&para;<br>voting strength.” Ibid. (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 94–196,&para;<br>p. 10 (1975)). See also Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630,&para;<br>640 (1993) (“[I]t soon became apparent that guaranteeing&para;<br>equal access to the polls would not suffice to root out other&para;<br>racially discriminatory voting practices” such as voting&para;<br>dilution). Efforts to reduce the impact of minority votes,&para;<br>in contrast to direct attempts to block access to the bal­&para;<br>lot, are aptly described as “second-generation barriers” to&para;<br>minority voting.&para;<br>Second-generation barriers come in various forms. One&para;<br>of the blockages is racial gerrymandering, the redrawing&para;<br>of legislative districts in an “effort to segregate the races&para;<br>for purposes of voting.” Id., at 642. Another is adoption of&para;<br>a system of at-large voting in lieu of district-by-district&para;<br>voting in a city with a sizable black minority.

The Fifteenth Amend­&para;<br>ment, which targets precisely and only racial discrimina­&para;<br>tion in voting rights, states that, in this domain, “Congress&para;<br>shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate&para;<br>legislation.”2 In choosing this language, the Amendment’s&para;<br>framers invoked Chief Justice Marshall’s formulation of&para;<br>the scope of Congress’ powers under the Necessary and&para;<br>Proper Clause:&para;<br>“Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of&para;<br>the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,&para;<br>which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not&para;<br>prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the&para;<br>constitution, are constitutional.” McCulloch v.

The implication is unmistakable:&para;<br>Under our constitutional structure, Congress holds the lead rein in&para;<br>making the right to vote equally real for all U. S. citizens.

In exercising that power, then, Congress&para;<br>may use “all means which are appropriate, which are&para;<br>plainly adapted” to the constitutional ends declared by&para;<br>these Amendments. McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 421. So&para;<br>when Congress acts to enforce the right to vote free from&para;<br>racial discrimination, we ask not whether Congress has&para;<br>chosen the means most wise, but whether Congress has&para;<br>rationally selected means appropriate to a legitimate end.&para;<br>“It is not for us to review the congressional resolution of&para;<br>[the need for its chosen remedy]. It is enough that we be&para;<br>able to perceive a basis upon which the Congress might&para;<br>resolve the conflict as it did.” Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384&para;<br>U. S. 641, 653 (1966).&para;<br>Until today, in considering the constitutionality of the&para;<br>VRA, the Court has accorded Congress the full measure of&para;<br>respect its judgments in this domain should garner. South&para;<br>Carolina v. Katzenbach supplies the standard of review:&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“As against the reserved powers of the States, Congress&para;<br>may use any rational means to effectuate the constitu­&para;<br>tional prohibition of racial discrimination in voting.” 383&para;<br>U. S., at 324. Faced with subsequent reauthorizations of&para;<br>the VRA, the Court has reaffirmed this standard. E.g.,&para;<br>City of Rome, 446 U. S., at 178. Today’s Court does not&para;<br>purport to alter settled precedent establishing that the&para;<br>dispositive question is whether Congress has employed&para;<br>“rational means.”&para;<br>For three reasons, legislation reauthorizing an existing&para;<br>statute is especially likely to satisfy the minimal require­&para;<br>ments of the rational-basis test. First, when reauthorization&para;<br>is at issue, Congress has already assembled a legislative&para;<br>record justifying the initial legislation. Congress is en­&para;<br>titled to consider that preexisting record as well as the&para;<br>record before it at the time of the vote on reauthorization.&para;<br>This is especially true where, as here, the Court has re­&para;<br>peatedly affirmed the statute’s constitutionality and Con­&para;<br>gress has adhered to the very model the Court has upheld.&para;<br>See id., at 174 (“The appellants are asking us to do noth­&para;<br>ing less than overrule our decision in South Carolina v.&para;<br>Katzenbach . . . , in which we upheld the constitutionality&para;<br>of the Act.”); Lopez v. Monterey County, 525 U. S. 266, 283&para;<br>(1999) (similar).&para;<br>Second, the very fact that reauthorization is necessary&para;<br>arises because Congress has built a temporal limitation&para;<br>into the Act. It has pledged to review, after a span of&para;<br>years (first 15, then 25) and in light of contemporary&para;<br>evidence, the continued need for the VRA. Cf. Grutter v.&para;<br>Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 343 (2003) (anticipating, but not&para;<br>guaranteeing, that, in 25 years, “the use of racial prefer­&para;<br>ences [in higher education] will no longer be necessary”).&para;<br>Third, a reviewing court should expect the record sup­&para;<br>porting reauthorization to be less stark than the record&para;<br>originally made. Demand for a record of violations equiva­&para;<br>lent to the one earlier made would expose Congress to a&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>catch-22. If the statute was working, there would be less&para;<br>evidence of discrimination, so opponents might argue that&para;<br>Congress should not be allowed to renew the statute. In&para;<br>contrast, if the statute was not working, there would be&para;<br>plenty of evidence of discrimination, but scant reason to&para;<br>renew a failed regulatory regime. See Persily 193–194.&para;<br>This is not to suggest that congressional power in this&para;<br>area is limitless. It is this Court’s responsibility to ensure&para;<br>that Congress has used appropriate means. The question&para;<br>meet for judicial review is whether the chosen means are&para;<br>“adapted to carry out the objects the amendments have in&para;<br>view.” Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 346 (1880). The&para;<br>Court’s role, then, is not to substitute its judgment for that&para;<br>of Congress, but to determine whether the legislative&para;<br>record sufficed to show that “Congress could rationally&para;<br>have determined that [its chosen] provisions were appro­&para;<br>priate methods.” City of Rome, 446 U. S., at 176–177.&para;<br>In summary, the Constitution vests broad power in&para;<br>Congress to protect the right to vote, and in particular to&para;<br>combat racial discrimination in voting. This Court has&para;<br>repeatedly reaffirmed Congress’ prerogative to use any&para;<br>rational means in exercise of its power in this area. And&para;<br>both precedent and logic dictate that the rational-means&para;<br>test should be easier to satisfy, and the burden on the&para;<br>statute’s challenger should be higher, when what is at&para;<br>issue is the reauthorization of a remedy that the Court has&para;<br>previously affirmed, and that Congress found, from con­&para;<br>temporary evidence, to be working to advance the legisla­&para;<br>ture’s legitimate objective.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The 2006 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act fully&para;<br>satisfies the standard stated in McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at&para;<br>421: Congress may choose any means “appropriate” and&para;<br>“plainly adapted to” a legitimate constitutional end. As we&para;<br>shall see, it is implausible to suggest otherwise.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

The surest&para;<br>way to evaluate whether that remedy remains in order is&para;<br>to see if preclearance is still effectively preventing discrim­&para;<br>inatory changes to voting laws. See City of Rome, 446&para;<br>U.

On that score, the record before&para;<br>Congress was huge. In fact, Congress found there were&para;<br>more DOJ objections between 1982 and 2004 (626) than&para;<br>there were between 1965 and the 1982 reauthorization&para;<br>(490). 1 Voting Rights Act: Evidence of Continued Need,&para;<br>Hearing before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of&para;<br>the House Committee on the Judiciary, 109th Cong., 2d&para;<br>Sess., p. 172 (2006) (hereinafter Evidence of Continued&para;<br>Need).&para;<br>All told, between 1982 and 2006, DOJ objections blocked&para;<br>over 700 voting changes based on a determination that the&para;<br>changes were discriminatory. H. R. Rep. No. 109–478, at&para;<br>21. Congress found that the majority of DOJ objections&para;<br>included findings of discriminatory intent, see 679 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 867, and that the changes blocked by preclearance were&para;<br>“calculated decisions to keep minority voters from fully&para;<br>participating in the political process.” H.

Ibid.&para;<br>B&para;<br>I turn next to the evidence on which Congress based its&para;<br>decision to reauthorize the coverage formula in §4(b).&para;<br>Because Congress did not alter the coverage formula, the&para;<br>same jurisdictions previously subject to preclearance&para;<br>continue to be covered by this remedy. The evidence just&para;<br>described, of preclearance’s continuing efficacy in blocking&para;<br>constitutional violations in the covered jurisdictions, itself&para;<br>grounded Congress’ conclusion that the remedy should be&para;<br>retained for those jurisdictions.&para;<br>There is no question, moreover, that the covered juris­&para;<br>dictions have a unique history of problems with racial&para;<br>discrimination in voting. Ante, at 12–13. Consideration of&para;<br>this long history, still in living memory, was altogether&para;<br>appropriate. The Court criticizes Congress for failing to&para;<br>recognize that “history did not end in 1965.” Ante, at 20.&para;<br>But the Court ignores that “what’s past is prologue.” W.&para;<br>Shakespeare, The Tempest, act 2, sc. 1. And “[t]hose who&para;<br>cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” 1&para;<br>G. Santayana, The Life of Reason 284 (1905). Congress&para;<br>was especially mindful of the need to reinforce the gains&para;<br>already made and to prevent backsliding. 2006 Reauthor­&para;<br>ization §2(b)(9).&para;<br>Of particular importance, even after 40 years and thou­&para;<br>sands of discriminatory changes blocked by preclearance,&para;<br>conditions in the covered jurisdictions demonstrated that&para;<br>the formula was still justified by “current needs.” Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 203.&para;<br>Congress learned of these conditions through a report,&para;<br>known as the Katz study, that looked at §2 suits between&para;<br>1982 and 2004.

Because the pri­&para;<br>vate right of action authorized by §2 of the VRA applies&para;<br>nationwide, a comparison of §2 lawsuits in covered and&para;<br>noncovered jurisdictions provides an appropriate yardstick&para;<br>for measuring differences between covered and noncovered&para;<br>jurisdictions. If differences in the risk of voting discrimi­&para;<br>nation between covered and noncovered jurisdictions had&para;<br>disappeared, one would expect that the rate of successful&para;<br>§2 lawsuits would be roughly the same in both areas.6 The&para;<br>study’s findings, however, indicated that racial discrimi­&para;<br>nation in voting remains “concentrated in the jurisdictions&para;<br>singled out for preclearance.” Northwest Austin, 557 U. S.,&para;<br>at 203.&para;<br>Although covered jurisdictions account for less than 25&para;<br>percent of the country’s population, the Katz study re­&para;<br>vealed that they accounted for 56 percent of successful&para;<br>§2 litigation since 1982.

Impact and Effective­&para;<br>ness 974. From these findings—ignored by the Court—&para;<br>Congress reasonably concluded that the coverage formula&para;<br>continues to identify the jurisdictions of greatest concern.&para;<br>The evidence before Congress, furthermore, indicated&para;<br>that voting in the covered jurisdictions was more racially&para;<br>polarized than elsewhere in the country.

While racially polarized voting alone&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Because preclearance occurs only in covered jurisdictions and can be&para;<br>expected to stop the most obviously objectionable measures, one would&para;<br>expect a lower rate of successful §2 lawsuits in those jurisdictions if&para;<br>the risk of voting discrimination there were the same as elsewhere in the&para;<br>country.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

The reason is twofold.&para;<br>First, racial polarization means that racial minorities are&para;<br>at risk of being systematically outvoted and having their&para;<br>interests underrepresented in legislatures. Second, “when&para;<br>political preferences fall along racial lines, the natural&para;<br>inclinations of incumbents and ruling parties to entrench&para;<br>themselves have predictable racial effects. Under circum­&para;<br>stances of severe racial polarization, efforts to gain politi­&para;<br>cal advantage translate into race-specific disadvantages.”&para;<br>Ansolabehere, Persily, &amp; Stewart, Regional Differences&para;<br>in Racial Polarization in the 2012 Presidential Election:&para;<br>Implications for the Constitutionality of Section 5 of the&para;<br>Voting Rights Act, 126 Harv. L. Rev. Forum 205, 209&para;<br>(2013).&para;<br>In other words, a governing political coalition has an&para;<br>incentive to prevent changes in the existing balance of&para;<br>voting power. When voting is racially polarized, efforts by&para;<br>the ruling party to pursue that incentive “will inevitably&para;<br>discriminate against a racial group.” Ibid. Just as build­&para;<br>ings in California have a greater need to be earthquake­&para;<br>proofed, places where there is greater racial polarization&para;<br>in voting have a greater need for prophylactic measures to&para;<br>prevent purposeful race discrimination. This point was&para;<br>understood by Congress and is well recognized in the&para;<br>academic literature. See 2006 Reauthorization §2(b)(3),&para;<br>120 Stat. 577 (“The continued evidence of racially polar­&para;<br>ized voting in each of the jurisdictions covered by the&para;<br>[preclearance requirement] demonstrates that racial and&para;<br>language minorities remain politically vulnerable”); H. R.&para;<br>Rep. No. 109–478, at 35; Davidson, The Recent Evolution&para;<br>of Voting Rights Law Affecting Racial and Language&para;<br>Minorities, in Quiet Revolution 21, 22.&para;<br>The case for retaining a coverage formula that met&para;<br>needs on the ground was therefore solid. Congress might&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>have been charged with rigidity had it afforded covered&para;<br>jurisdictions no way out or ignored jurisdictions that&para;<br>needed superintendence. Congress, however, responded to&para;<br>this concern. Critical components of the congressional&para;<br>design are the statutory provisions allowing jurisdictions&para;<br>to “bail out” of preclearance, and for court-ordered “bail&para;<br>ins.” See Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 199. The VRA&para;<br>permits a jurisdiction to bail out by showing that it has&para;<br>complied with the Act for ten years, and has engaged in&para;<br>efforts to eliminate intimidation and harassment of vot­&para;<br>ers. 42 U. S. C. §1973b(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. V). It also&para;<br>authorizes a court to subject a noncovered jurisdiction to&para;<br>federal preclearance upon finding that violations of the&para;<br>Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments have occurred&para;<br>there. §1973a(c) (2006 ed.).&para;<br>Congress was satisfied that the VRA’s bailout mecha­&para;<br>nism provided an effective means of adjusting the VRA’s&para;<br>coverage over time. H. R. Rep. No. 109–478, at 25 (the&para;<br>success of bailout “illustrates that: (1) covered status is&para;<br>neither permanent nor over-broad; and (2) covered status&para;<br>has been and continues to be within the control of the&para;<br>jurisdiction such that those jurisdictions that have a genu­&para;<br>inely clean record and want to terminate coverage have&para;<br>the ability to do so”). Nearly 200 jurisdictions have suc­&para;<br>cessfully bailed out of the preclearance requirement, and&para;<br>DOJ has consented to every bailout application filed by an&para;<br>eligible jurisdiction since the current bailout procedure&para;<br>became effective in 1984. Brief for Federal Respondent 54.&para;<br>The bail-in mechanism has also worked. Several jurisdic­&para;<br>tions have been subject to federal preclearance by court&para;<br>orders, including the States of New Mexico and Arkansas.&para;<br>App. to Brief for Federal Respondent 1a–3a.&para;<br>This experience exposes the inaccuracy of the Court’s&para;<br>portrayal of the Act as static, unchanged since 1965.&para;<br>Congress designed the VRA to be a dynamic statute, capa­&para;<br>ble of adjusting to changing conditions. True, many cov­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ered jurisdictions have not been able to bail out due to&para;<br>recent acts of noncompliance with the VRA, but that truth&para;<br>reinforces the congressional judgment that these jurisdic­&para;<br>tions were rightfully subject to preclearance, and ought to&para;<br>remain under that regime.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Congress approached the 2006 reauthorization of the&para;<br>VRA with great care and seriousness. The same cannot be&para;<br>said of the Court’s opinion today. The Court makes no&para;<br>genuine attempt to engage with the massive legislative&para;<br>record that Congress assembled. Instead, it relies on&para;<br>increases in voter registration and turnout as if that were&para;<br>the whole story. See supra, at 18–19. Without even&para;<br>identifying a standard of review, the Court dismissively&para;<br>brushes off arguments based on “data from the record,” and&para;<br>declines to enter the “debat[e about] what [the] record&para;<br>shows.” Ante, at 20–21. One would expect more from an&para;<br>opinion striking at the heart of the Nation’s signal piece of&para;<br>civil-rights legislation.&para;<br>I note the most disturbing lapses. First, by what right,&para;<br>given its usual restraint, does the Court even address&para;<br>Shelby County’s facial challenge to the VRA? Second, the&para;<br>Court veers away from controlling precedent regarding the&para;<br>“equal sovereignty” doctrine without even acknowledging&para;<br>that it is doing so. Third, hardly showing the respect&para;<br>ordinarily paid when Congress acts to implement the Civil&para;<br>War Amendments, and as just stressed, the Court does not&para;<br>even deign to grapple with the legislative record.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Shelby County launched a purely facial challenge to the&para;<br>VRA’s 2006 reauthorization. “A facial challenge to a&para;<br>legislative Act,” the Court has other times said, “is, of&para;<br>course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,&para;<br>since the challenger must establish that no set of circum­&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>stances exists under which the Act would be valid.” United&para;<br>States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987).&para;<br>“[U]nder our constitutional system[,] courts are not&para;<br>roving commissions assigned to pass judgment on the&para;<br>validity of the Nation’s laws.” Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413&para;<br>U. S. 601, 610–611 (1973). Instead, the “judicial Power” is&para;<br>limited to deciding particular “Cases” and “Controversies.”&para;<br>U. S. Const., Art. III, §2. “Embedded in the traditional&para;<br>rules governing constitutional adjudication is the principle&para;<br>that a person to whom a statute may constitutionally be&para;<br>applied will not be heard to challenge that statute on the&para;<br>ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitution­&para;<br>ally to others, in other situations not before the Court.”&para;<br>Broadrick, 413 U. S., at 610. Yet the Court’s opinion in&para;<br>this case contains not a word explaining why Congress&para;<br>lacks the power to subject to preclearance the particular&para;<br>plaintiff that initiated this lawsuit—Shelby County, Ala­&para;<br>bama. The reason for the Court’s silence is apparent, for&para;<br>as applied to Shelby County, the VRA’s preclearance&para;<br>requirement is hardly contestable.&para;<br>Alabama is home to Selma, site of the “Bloody Sunday”&para;<br>beatings of civil-rights demonstrators that served as the&para;<br>catalyst for the VRA’s enactment. Following those events,&para;<br>Martin Luther King, Jr., led a march from Selma to Mont­&para;<br>gomery, Alabama’s capital, where he called for passage of&para;<br>the VRA. If the Act passed, he foresaw, progress could be&para;<br>made even in Alabama, but there had to be a steadfast&para;<br>national commitment to see the task through to comple­&para;<br>tion. In King’s words, “the arc of the moral universe is&para;<br>long, but it bends toward justice.” G. May, Bending To­&para;<br>ward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transfor­&para;<br>mation of American Democracy 144 (2013).&para;<br>History has proved King right. Although circumstances&para;<br>in Alabama have changed, serious concerns remain.&para;<br>Between 1982 and 2005, Alabama had one of the highest&para;<br>rates of successful §2 suits, second only to its VRA-covered&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>neighbor Mississippi. 679 F. 3d, at 897 (Williams, J.,&para;<br>dissenting). In other words, even while subject to the&para;<br>restraining effect of §5, Alabama was found to have&para;<br>“deni[ed] or abridge[d]” voting rights “on account of race or&para;<br>color” more frequently than nearly all other States in the&para;<br>Union. 42 U. S. C. §1973(a). This fact prompted the&para;<br>dissenting judge below to concede that “a more narrowly&para;<br>tailored coverage formula” capturing Alabama and a&para;<br>handful of other jurisdictions with an established track&para;<br>record of racial discrimination in voting “might be defensi­&para;<br>ble.” 679 F. 3d, at 897 (opinion of Williams, J.). That is an&para;<br>understatement. Alabama’s sorry history of §2 violations&para;<br>alone provides sufficient justification for Congress’ deter­&para;<br>mination in 2006 that the State should remain subject to&para;<br>§5’s preclearance requirement.7&para;<br>A few examples suffice to demonstrate that, at least in&para;<br>Alabama, the “current burdens” imposed by §5’s preclear­&para;<br>ance requirement are “justified by current needs.” Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 203. In the interim between the&para;<br>VRA’s 1982 and 2006 reauthorizations, this Court twice&para;<br>confronted purposeful racial discrimination in Alabama.&para;<br>In Pleasant Grove v. United States, 479 U. S. 462 (1987),&para;<br>the Court held that Pleasant Grove—a city in Jefferson&para;<br>County, Shelby County’s neighbor—engaged in purposeful&para;<br>discrimination by annexing all-white areas while rejecting&para;<br>the annexation request of an adjacent black neighborhood.&para;<br>The city had “shown unambiguous opposition to racial&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 This lawsuit was filed by Shelby County, a political subdivision of&para;<br>Alabama, rather than by the State itself. Nevertheless, it is appropri­&para;<br>ate to judge Shelby County’s constitutional challenge in light of in­&para;<br>stances of discrimination statewide because Shelby County is subject to&para;<br>§5’s preclearance requirement by virtue of Alabama’s designation as a&para;<br>covered jurisdiction under §4(b) of the VRA. See ante, at 7. In any&para;<br>event, Shelby County’s recent record of employing an at-large electoral&para;<br>system tainted by intentional racial discrimination is by itself sufficient&para;<br>to justify subjecting the county to §5’s preclearance mandate. See infra,&para;<br>at 26.&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>integration, both before and after the passage of the fed­&para;<br>eral civil rights laws,” and its strategic annexations&para;<br>appeared to be an attempt “to provide for the growth of&para;<br>a monolithic white voting block” for “the impermissible&para;<br>purpose of minimizing future black voting strength.” Id.,&para;<br>at 465, 471–472.&para;<br>Two years before Pleasant Grove, the Court in Hunter v.&para;<br>Underwood, 471 U. S. 222 (1985), struck down a provision&para;<br>of the Alabama Constitution that prohibited individuals&para;<br>convicted of misdemeanor offenses “involving moral turpi­&para;<br>tude” from voting. Id., at 223 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). The provision violated the Fourteenth Amend­&para;<br>ment’s Equal Protection Clause, the Court unanimously&para;<br>concluded, because “its original enactment was motivated&para;<br>by a desire to discriminate against blacks on account of&para;<br>race[,] and the [provision] continues to this day to have&para;<br>that effect.” Id., at 233.&para;<br>Pleasant Grove and Hunter were not anomalies. In&para;<br>1986, a Federal District Judge concluded that the at-large&para;<br>election systems in several Alabama counties violated §2.&para;<br>Dillard v. Crenshaw Cty., 640 F. Supp. 1347, 1354–1363&para;<br>(MD Ala. 1986). Summarizing its findings, the court&para;<br>stated that “[f ]rom the late 1800’s through the present,&para;<br>[Alabama] has consistently erected barriers to keep black&para;<br>persons from full and equal participation in the social,&para;<br>economic, and political life of the state.” Id., at 1360.&para;<br>The Dillard litigation ultimately expanded to include&para;<br>183 cities, counties, and school boards employing discrim­&para;<br>inatory at-large election systems.

Supp. 2d 424, 443 (DC 2011). Although&para;<br>DOJ objected to the plan, Calera forged ahead with elec­&para;<br>tions based on the unprecleared voting changes, resulting&para;<br>in the defeat of the incumbent African-American council­&para;<br>man who represented the former majority-black district.&para;<br>Ibid. The city’s defiance required DOJ to bring a §5 en­&para;<br>forcement action that ultimately yielded appropriate&para;<br>redress, including restoration of the majority-black dis­&para;<br>trict.

Recording devices worn by&para;<br>state legislators cooperating with the FBI’s investigation&para;<br>captured conversations between members of the state&para;<br>legislature and their political allies. The recorded conver­&para;<br>sations are shocking. Members of the state Senate deri­&para;<br>sively refer to African-Americans as “Aborigines” and talk&para;<br>openly of their aim to quash a particular gambling-related&para;<br>referendum because the referendum, if placed on the&para;<br>ballot, might increase African-American voter turnout.&para;<br>Id., at 1345–1346 (internal quotation marks omitted). See&para;<br>also id., at 1345 (legislators and their allies expressed&para;<br>concern that if the referendum were placed on the ballot,&para;<br>“ ‘[e]very black, every illiterate’ would be ‘bused [to the&para;<br>polls] on HUD financed buses’ ”). These conversations oc­&para;<br>curred not in the 1870’s, or even in the 1960’s, they took&para;<br>place in 2010. Id., at 1344–1345. The District Judge&para;<br>presiding over the criminal trial at which the recorded&para;<br>conversations were introduced commented that the “re­&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v.

In today’s decision, the Court ratchets&para;<br>up what was pure dictum in Northwest Austin, attributing&para;<br>breadth to the equal sovereignty principle in flat contra­&para;<br>diction of Katzenbach.

In 1965, there were a “small number of States . . .&para;<br>which in most instances were familiar to Congress by&para;<br>name,” on which Congress fixed its attention. Katzenbach,&para;<br>383 U.

In drafting the coverage formula, “Con­&para;<br>gress began work with reliable evidence of actual voting&para;<br>discrimination in a great majority of the States” it sought&para;<br>to target. Id., at 329. “The formula [Congress] eventually&para;<br>evolved to describe these areas” also captured a few States&para;<br>that had not been the subject of congressional factfinding.&para;<br>Ibid. Nevertheless, the Court upheld the formula in its&para;<br>entirety, finding it fair “to infer a significant danger of the&para;<br>evil” in all places the formula covered. Ibid.&para;<br>The situation Congress faced in 2006, when it took up&para;<br>reauthorization of the coverage formula, was not the same.&para;<br>By then, the formula had been in effect for many years,&para;<br>and all of the jurisdictions covered by it were “familiar&para;<br>to Congress by name.” Id., at 328. The question before&para;<br>Congress: Was there still a sufficient basis to support&para;<br>continued application of the preclearance remedy in each&para;<br>of those already-identified places? There was at that point&para;<br>no chance that the formula might inadvertently sweep in&para;<br>new areas that were not the subject of congressional&para;<br>findings. And Congress could determine from the record&para;<br>whether the jurisdictions captured by the coverage for­&para;<br>mula still belonged under the preclearance regime. If they&para;<br>did, there was no need to alter the formula.

The coverage provision identified a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

Recent&para;<br>evidence relating to Alabama and its counties was there&para;<br>for all to see. Multiple Supreme Court decisions had&para;<br>upheld the coverage provision, most recently in 1999.&para;<br>There was extensive evidence that, due to the preclear­&para;<br>ance mechanism, conditions in the covered jurisdictions&para;<br>had notably improved. And there was evidence that pre­&para;<br>clearance was still having a substantial real-world effect,&para;<br>having stopped hundreds of discriminatory voting changes&para;<br>in the covered jurisdictions since the last reauthorization.&para;<br>In addition, there was evidence that racial polarization in&para;<br>voting was higher in covered jurisdictions than elsewhere,&para;<br>increasing the vulnerability of minority citizens in those&para;<br>jurisdictions. And countless witnesses, reports, and case&para;<br>studies documented continuing problems with voting dis­&para;<br>crimination in those jurisdictions. In light of this rec­&para;<br>ord, Congress had more than a reasonable basis to&para;<br>conclude that the existing coverage formula was not out of&para;<br>sync with conditions on the ground in covered areas. And&para;<br>certainly Shelby County was no candidate for release&para;<br>through the mechanism Congress provided. See supra, at&para;<br>22–23, 26–28.&para;<br>The Court holds §4(b) invalid on the ground that it is&para;<br>“irrational to base coverage on the use of voting tests 40&para;<br>years ago, when such tests have been illegal since that&para;<br>time.” Ante, at 23. But the Court disregards what Con­&para;<br>gress set about to do in enacting the VRA. That extraor­&para;<br>dinary legislation scarcely stopped at the particular tests&para;<br>and devices that happened to exist in 1965. The grand&para;<br>aim of the Act is to secure to all in our polity equal citizen­&para;<br>ship stature, a voice in our democracy undiluted by race.&para;<br>As the record for the 2006 reauthorization makes abun­&para;<br>dantly clear, second-generation barriers to minority voting&para;<br>rights have emerged in the covered jurisdictions as at­&para;<br>tempted substitutes for the first-generation barriers that&para;<br>&para;<br>36&para;<br>&para;<br>SHELBY COUNTY v.

The Court&para;<br>appears to believe that the VRA’s success in eliminating&para;<br>the specific devices extant in 1965 means that preclear­&para;<br>ance is no longer needed. Ante, at 21–22, 23–24. With&para;<br>that belief, and the argument derived from it, history&para;<br>repeats itself. The same assumption—that the problem&para;<br>could be solved when particular methods of voting discrim­&para;<br>ination are identified and eliminated—was indulged and&para;<br>proved wrong repeatedly prior to the VRA’s enactment.&para;<br>Unlike prior statutes, which singled out particular tests or&para;<br>devices, the VRA is grounded in Congress’ recognition of&para;<br>the “variety and persistence” of measures designed to&para;<br>impair minority voting rights. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at&para;<br>311; supra, at 2. In truth, the evolution of voting discrim­&para;<br>ination into more subtle second-generation barriers is&para;<br>powerful evidence that a remedy as effective as preclear­&para;<br>ance remains vital to protect minority voting rights and&para;<br>prevent backsliding.&para;<br>Beyond question, the VRA is no ordinary legislation. It&para;<br>is extraordinary because Congress embarked on a mission&para;<br>long delayed and of extraordinary importance: to realize&para;<br>the purpose and promise of the Fifteenth Amendment.&para;<br>For a half century, a concerted effort has been made to&para;<br>end racial discrimination in voting.
