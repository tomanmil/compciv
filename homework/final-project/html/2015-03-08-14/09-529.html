STEWART, COMMISSIONER, VIRGINIA &para;<br>&para;<br>DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH&para;<br>&para;<br>AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES, ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FOURTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–529.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued December 1, 2010—Decided April 19, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>Together, the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights&para;<br>Act of 2000 (DD Act) and the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals&para;<br>with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI Act) offer States federal money to&para;<br>improve, inter alia, medical care for persons with developmental dis&para;<br>abilities or mental illness. As a condition of funding, a State must es&para;<br>tablish a protection and advocacy (P&amp;A) system “to protect and advo&para;<br>cate [those individuals’] rights.”&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §15043(a)(1).&para;<br>A&para;<br>participating State may appoint either a state agency or a private&para;<br>nonprofit entity as its P&amp;A system, but if a state agency it must have&para;<br>authority to litigate and freedom from the control of other state agen&para;<br>cies or officers. Virginia has appointed an independent state agency,&para;<br>petitioner Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA), au&para;<br>thorizing it to litigate to secure disabled individuals’ rights, free of&para;<br>executive-branch oversight; to operate independently of Virginia’s at&para;<br>torney general; and to employ its own lawyers to sue on its behalf.&para;<br>While investigating patient deaths and injuries at state mental&para;<br>hospitals, VOPA asked respondents—state officials in charge of those&para;<br>hospitals—to produce relevant patient records. Respondents refused,&para;<br>asserting that a state-law privilege shielded the records from disclo&para;<br>sure. VOPA then filed suit in Federal District Court, seeking a dec&para;<br>laration that respondents’ refusal to produce the records violated the&para;<br>DD and PAIMI Acts and an injunction requiring respondents to pro&para;<br>duce the records and refrain in the future from interfering with&para;<br>VOPA’s right of access. Respondents moved to dismiss on the ground&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY&para;<br>v. STEWART&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment, but&para;<br>the court held that the suit was permitted by the doctrine of Ex parte&para;<br>Young, 209 U. S. 123, which normally allows federal courts to award&para;<br>prospective relief against state officials for violations of federal law.&para;<br>The Fourth Circuit reversed, finding that Ex parte Young did not ap&para;<br>ply because the suit was brought by a state agency.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Ex parte Young allows a federal court to hear a lawsuit for pro&para;<br>spective relief against state officials brought by another agency of the&para;<br>same State. Pp. 4–13.&para;<br>(a) Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity by a State itself or a&para;<br>valid abrogation by Congress, federal courts may not entertain a pri&para;<br>vate person’s suit against a State. Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(b) The doctrine of Ex parte Young, which establishes an important&para;<br>limitation on the sovereign-immunity principle, is accepted as neces&para;<br>sary to “permit the federal courts to vindicate federal rights.” Penn&para;<br>hurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89. It rests&para;<br>on the premise that when a federal court commands a state official to&para;<br>do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law, he is not the&para;<br>State for sovereign-immunity purposes. It does not apply “when ‘the&para;<br>state is the . . . party in interest.’ ” Id., at 101. Pp. 5–6.&para;<br>(c) Entertaining VOPA’s action is consistent with precedent and&para;<br>does not offend the distinctive interests protected by sovereign im&para;<br>munity. Pp. 6–13.&para;<br>(1) Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U. S.&para;<br>635, held that, in determining the Ex parte Young doctrine’s applica&para;<br>bility, “a court need only conduct a ‘straightforward inquiry into&para;<br>whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law&para;<br>and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.’ ” Id., at 645.&para;<br>VOPA’s suit satisfies that inquiry. Respondents concede that the ac&para;<br>tion would be proper were VOPA a private organization rather than a&para;<br>state agency. The “general criterion for determining when a suit is in&para;<br>fact against the sovereign is the effect of the relief sought,” Penn&para;<br>hurst, supra, at 107, not who is bringing the lawsuit. This Court ap&para;<br>plied that criterion in Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S.&para;<br>261, which held that an Indian Tribe could not invoke Ex parte Young&para;<br>to bring what was essentially a quiet title suit that would “extinguish&para;<br>[Idaho’s] control over . . . lands and waters long deemed . . . an inte&para;<br>gral part of its territory.” Id., at 282. Respondents have advanced no&para;<br>argument that the relief sought here threatens a similar invasion of&para;<br>Virginia’s sovereignty. Pp. 7–9.&para;<br>(2) Respondents claim that a State’s dignity is diminished when&para;<br>a federal court adjudicates a dispute between its components. But a&para;<br>State’s stature is not diminished to any greater degree when its own&para;<br>agency sues to enforce its officers’ compliance with federal law than&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>when a private person does so. Moreover, VOPA’s power to sue state&para;<br>officials is a consequence of Virginia’s own decision to establish a&para;<br>public P&amp;A system. Not every offense to a State’s dignity constitutes&para;<br>a denial of sovereign immunity. The specific indignity against which&para;<br>sovereign immunity protects is the insult to a State of being haled&para;<br>into court without its consent; that does not occur just because a suit&para;<br>happens to be brought by another state agency. Pp. 9–11.&para;<br>(3) The apparent novelty of this suit is not likely a consequence&para;<br>of past constitutional doubts. In order to invoke the Ex parte Young&para;<br>exception, a state agency needs both a federal right that it possesses&para;<br>against its parent State and authority to sue state officials to enforce&para;<br>that right, free from any internal state-government veto; such condi&para;<br>tions rarely coincide. In any event, the principles undergirding the&para;<br>Ex parte Young doctrine support its extension to actions of this kind.&para;<br>Pp. 12–13.&para;<br>568 F. 3d 110, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which KENNEDY,&para;<br>THOMAS, GINSBURG, BREYER, and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., joined.

At present, every State accepts funds under&para;<br>these statutes.&para;<br>Under the DD and PAIMI Acts, a P&amp;A system must&para;<br>have certain powers. The system “shall . . . have the&para;<br>authority to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect . . .&para;<br>if the incidents are reported to the system or if there is&para;<br>probable cause to believe that the incidents occurred.”&para;<br>§15043(a)(2)(B); §10805(a)(1)(A).

The Acts also require that a&para;<br>P&amp;A system have authority to “pursue legal, administra&para;<br>tive, and other appropriate remedies or approaches to&para;<br>ensure the protection of” its charges. §15043(a)(2)(A)(i);&para;<br>see §10805(a)(1)(B). And in addition to pressing its own&para;<br>rights, a P&amp;A system may “pursue administrative, legal,&para;<br>and other remedies on behalf of” those it protects.&para;<br>§10805(a)(1)(C); see §15044(b).&para;<br>A participating State is free to appoint either a state&para;<br>agency or a private nonprofit entity as its P&amp;A system.&para;<br>§15044(a); §10805(c)(1)(B).

S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§15043(a)(4)(A).&para;<br>Virginia is one of just eight States that have designated&para;<br>a government entity as their P&amp;A system. The Virginia&para;<br>Office for Protection and Advocacy (VOPA) is an “inde&para;<br>pendent state agency.” Va. Code Ann. §51.5–39.2(A)&para;<br>(Lexis 2009). Its board consists of eleven “nonlegislative&para;<br>citizen members,” of whom only three are appointed by&para;<br>the Governor. §51.5–39.2(B). The remaining eight are&para;<br>appointed by components of the legislature: five by the&para;<br>Speaker of the House of Delegates, and three by the Sen&para;<br>ate Committee on Rules. Ibid. VOPA itself nominates&para;<br>candidates for consideration, and the statute instructs the&para;<br>appointing officials that they “shall seriously consider the&para;<br>persons nominated and appoint such persons whenever&para;<br>feasible.” Ibid. Board members serve for fixed terms and&para;<br>are removable only by a court and only for specified rea&para;<br>sons. See §51.5–39.2(C) and (F); §24.2–233 and 234 (Lexis&para;<br>2006).&para;<br>VOPA enjoys authority to litigate free of executive&para;<br>branch oversight. It operates independently of the Attor&para;<br>ney General of Virginia and employs its own lawyers, who&para;<br>are statutorily authorized to sue on VOPA’s behalf. §51.5–&para;<br>39.2(A); §2.2–510(5) (Lexis 2008). And Virginia law spe&para;<br>cifically empowers VOPA to “initiate any proceedings to&para;<br>secure the rights” of disabled individuals. §51.5–39.2(A).&para;<br>B&para;<br>In 2006, VOPA opened an investigation into the deaths&para;<br>of two patients and injuries to a third at state-run mental&para;<br>hospitals. It asked respondents—state officials in charge&para;<br>of those institutions—to produce any records related to&para;<br>risk-management or mortality reviews conducted by the&para;<br>hospitals with respect to those patients. Respondents&para;<br>refused, asserting that the records were protected by a&para;<br>state-law privilege shielding medical peer-review materi&para;<br>als from disclosure.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY&para;<br>v. STEWART&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>VOPA then brought this action in the United States&para;<br>District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging&para;<br>that the DD and PAIMI Acts entitled it to the peer-review&para;<br>records, notwithstanding any state-law privilege that&para;<br>might apply. It sought a declaration that respondents’&para;<br>refusal to produce the records violated the DD and PAIMI&para;<br>Acts, along with an injunction requiring respondents to&para;<br>provide access to the records and refrain in the future&para;<br>from interfering with VOPA’s right of access to them.&para;<br>Respondents moved to dismiss the action on the grounds&para;<br>that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh&para;<br>Amendment. The District Court denied the motion. In its&para;<br>view, the suit was permitted by the doctrine of Ex parte&para;<br>Young, which normally allows federal courts to award&para;<br>prospective relief against state officials for violations of&para;<br>federal law. Virginia v. Reinhard, 2008 WL 2795940, *6&para;<br>(ED Va., July 18, 2008).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals reversed. Virginia v. Reinhard,&para;<br>568 F. 3d 110 (CA4 2009). Believing VOPA’s lawsuit to be&para;<br>an “intramural contest” that “encroaches more severely on&para;<br>the dignity and sovereignty of the states than an Ex parte&para;<br>Young action brought by a private plaintiff,” the Court of&para;<br>Appeals concluded it was not authorized by that case.

S. 1 (1890), however, we have understood the Eleventh&para;<br>Amendment to confirm the structural understanding that&para;<br>States entered the Union with their sovereign immunity&para;<br>intact, unlimited by Article III’s jurisdictional grant.&para;<br>Blatchford v.

Maine, 527 U. S.&para;<br>706, 713 (1999). A State may waive its sovereign immu&para;<br>nity at its pleasure, College Savings Bank v. Florida Pre&para;<br>paid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 675–&para;<br>676 (1999), and in some circumstances Congress may&para;<br>abrogate it by appropriate legislation.2 But absent waiver&para;<br>or valid abrogation, federal courts may not entertain a&para;<br>private person’s suit against a State.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In Ex parte Young, 209 U.

In his habeas corpus application in this&para;<br>Court, Young challenged his confinement by arguing that&para;<br>Minnesota’s sovereign immunity deprived the federal&para;<br>court of jurisdiction to enjoin him from performing his&para;<br>official duties.&para;<br>We disagreed. We explained that because an unconsti&para;<br>tutional legislative enactment is “void,” a state official who&para;<br>enforces that law “comes into conflict with the superior&para;<br>authority of [the] Constitution,” and therefore is “stripped&para;<br>of his official or representative character and is subjected&para;<br>in his person to the consequences of his individual con&para;<br>duct. The State has no power to impart to him any immu&para;<br>nity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the&para;<br>United States.” 209 U.

It rests on&para;<br>the premise—less delicately called a “fiction,” id., at 114,&para;<br>n. 25—that when a federal court commands a state official&para;<br>to do nothing more than refrain from violating federal law,&para;<br>he is not the State for sovereign-immunity purposes. The&para;<br>doctrine is limited to that precise situation, and does not&para;<br>apply “when ‘the state is the real, substantial party in&para;<br>interest,’ ” id., at 101 (quoting Ford Motor Co. v.

Although we&para;<br>have never encountered such a suit before, we are satis&para;<br>fied that entertaining VOPA’s action is consistent with our&para;<br>precedents and does not offend the distinctive interests&para;<br>protected by sovereign immunity.&para;<br>1&para;<br>In Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535&para;<br>U. S. 635 (2002), we held that “[i]n determining whether&para;<br>the doctrine of Ex parte Young avoids an Eleventh Amend&para;<br>ment bar to suit, a court need only conduct a ‘straightfor&para;<br>ward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an&para;<br>ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly&para;<br>characterized as prospective.’ ” Id., at 645 (quoting Idaho&para;<br>v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 296 (1997)&para;<br>(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg&para;<br>ment)). There is no doubt VOPA’s suit satisfies that&para;<br>straightforward inquiry. It alleges that respondents’&para;<br>refusal to produce the requested medical records violates&para;<br>federal law; and it seeks an injunction requiring the pro&para;<br>duction of the records, which would prospectively abate&para;<br>the alleged violation.

The reason we refused to&para;<br>permit suit to proceed in that case was that the Indian Gaming Regula&para;<br>tory Act created an alternative remedial scheme that would be under&para;<br>mined by permitting Ex parte Young suits; Congress, we said, had&para;<br>foreclosed recourse to the doctrine.

Although&para;<br>respondents argue that VOPA’s status as a state agency&para;<br>changes the calculus, there is no warrant in our cases for&para;<br>making the validity of an Ex parte Young action turn on&para;<br>the identity of the plaintiff. To be sure, we have been&para;<br>willing to police abuses of the doctrine that threaten to&para;<br>evade sovereign immunity. To do otherwise “would be&para;<br>to adhere to an empty formalism.” Coeur d’Alene Tribe,&para;<br>supra, at 270. But (as the dissent concedes, post, at 8&para;<br>(opinion of ROBERTS, C.

Thus, Ex parte Young cannot&para;<br>be used to obtain an injunction requiring the payment of&para;<br>funds from the State’s treasury, see Edelman v. Jordan,&para;<br>415 U.

In order to invoke the Ex parte Young&para;<br>exception to sovereign immunity, a state agency needs two&para;<br>things: first, a federal right that it possesses against its&para;<br>parent State; and second, authority to sue other state&para;<br>officials to enforce that right, free from any internal veto&para;<br>wielded by the state government.

As a result, Verizon Md.&para;<br>incorporates the very balancing it might at first seem to&para;<br>reject. Verizon Md. itself was an easy case, for it involved&para;<br>the same kind of preenforcement assertion of a defense&para;<br>that was at issue in Young. But when Young’s application&para;<br>is explored in novel contexts, as in Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene&para;<br>Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261 (1997), and also in this case,&para;<br>the inquiry “proves more complex,” Verizon Md., supra, at&para;<br>648 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).&para;<br>In this case, in my view, the Virginia Office for Protec&para;<br>tion and Advocacy may rely on Young, despite the some&para;<br>what striking novelty of permitting a state agency to sue&para;<br>officials of the same State in federal court. In the posture&para;<br>of the case as it comes before the Court, it must be as&para;<br>sumed that VOPA has a federal right to the records it&para;<br>seeks, and so the extension of Young would vindicate the&para;<br>Supremacy Clause. To be balanced against this important&para;<br>interest is the need to preserve “the dignity and respect&para;<br>afforded a State, which the immunity is designed to pro&para;<br>tect.” Coeur d’Alene, supra, at 268. Permitting a state&para;<br>agency like VOPA to sue officials of the same State does&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

But the affront to the State’s dignity is&para;<br>diminished to some extent when it is noted that if the&para;<br>State had elected the alternate course of designating a&para;<br>private protection and advocacy system it then would have&para;<br>avoided any risk of internal conflict while still participat&para;<br>ing in the federal program. The availability of that alter&para;<br>nate course does not, in my view, weigh much in favor of&para;<br>the validity of the underlying federal scheme, but the only&para;<br>question here is the reach of the Young exception.&para;<br>Virginia’s concern that the holding here upsets the&para;<br>federal balance is further mitigated by the various protec&para;<br>tions built into the structure of federal litigation to ensure&para;<br>that state officials do not too often call upon the federal&para;<br>courts to resolve their intramural disputes.&para;<br>First, and most important, state law must authorize an&para;<br>agency or official to sue another arm of the State. If&para;<br>States do not wish to see their internal conflicts aired in&para;<br>federal court, they need not empower their officers or&para;<br>agencies to sue one another in a federal forum. And if&para;<br>state officers are not by state law empowered to sue, they&para;<br>may invoke federal jurisdiction only in their personal&para;<br>capacities.&para;<br>Second, to the extent there is some doubt under state&para;<br>law as to an officer’s or agency’s power to sue, or any other&para;<br>state-law issue that may be dispositive, federal courts&para;<br>should abstain under Railroad Comm’n of Tex. v. Pullman&para;<br>Co., 312 U. S. 496 (1941). Pullman recognizes the impor&para;<br>tance of state sovereignty by limiting federal judicial&para;<br>intervention in state affairs to cases where intervention is&para;<br>necessary. If an open question of state-law would resolve&para;<br>a dispute, then federal courts may wait for the resolution&para;<br>of the state-law issue before adjudicating the merits.&para;<br>Likewise, certification of questions of state law to the state&para;<br>courts may pretermit an otherwise sensitive federal con&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY&para;<br>v.

S. 386, 391&para;<br>(1974) (Certification “helps build a cooperative judicial&para;<br>federalism”).&para;<br>Finally, federal law does not often create rights for state&para;<br>officials or agencies to assert against other arms of the&para;<br>State. True, officials may assert that their personal fed&para;<br>eral rights are violated by unlawful state action, for exam&para;<br>ple where the State engages in discriminatory employ&para;<br>ment practices. But the statutory framework in the case&para;<br>now before the Court is unusual in that it vests a state&para;<br>agency itself with federal rights against the State. Stat&para;<br>utes tend to protect the rights of individuals, not officers&para;<br>or agencies, and the Constitution’s rights-creating Clauses&para;<br>protect persons rather than officers. Because the Young&para;<br>exception is available only to those who assert federal&para;<br>violations, the paucity of federal rights vested in govern&para;<br>ment officials makes the scope of the holding here a nar&para;<br>row one.&para;<br>All this is simply to underscore that the program at&para;<br>issue may present constitutional questions but that the&para;<br>parties do not raise them in this litigation. Virginia does&para;<br>not argue, for example, that Congress exceeded its spend&para;<br>ing power under Article I, §8 by forcing a state that wishes&para;<br>to designate a public agency as its advocacy system to&para;<br>allow intramural suits like the instant one or by requiring&para;<br>that the agency be structured as Congress directs. E.g., 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §15043(a)(2)(G) (system must “be independent of&para;<br>any agency that provides treatment, services, or habilita&para;<br>tion to individuals with developmental disabilities”);&para;<br>§15044(a)(2) (“[N]ot more than 1/3 of the members of the&para;<br>governing board may be appointed by the chief executive&para;<br>officer of the State”). Young—a court-made doctrine based&para;<br>on convenience, fiction, or both—neither implicates nor&para;<br>subsumes these more fundamental concerns regarding the&para;<br>excessive exercise of federal power. The Court should be&para;<br>most cautious before deciding cases that might later lead&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Assuming, as the Court&para;<br>must, that the statutes here are constitutional, the narrow&para;<br>question is whether VOPA may rely on Young to avoid the&para;<br>sovereign immunity bar.&para;<br>One might doubt whether the constitutional question&para;<br>may be so severed from the Young analysis. The Court&para;<br>wields Young in the name of the Supremacy Clause only to&para;<br>vindicate important federal rights. Perhaps this Court&para;<br>should not extend the fiction in the name of claims that&para;<br>may rest on unconstitutional foundations. This concern is&para;<br>misplaced. The canon of constitutional avoidance directs&para;<br>courts to prefer the interpretation of a statute that pre&para;<br>serves its validity, but the specter of a statute’s unconsti&para;<br>tutionality cannot be permitted to distort the antecedent&para;<br>question of jurisdiction. Courts interpret and evaluate a&para;<br>statute only after confirming their authority to adjudicate&para;<br>the case before them. To decline to adjudicate a federal&para;<br>right for fear of its potential unconstitutionality is in effect&para;<br>to invalidate the right in the quest to save it. The Court&para;<br>should not permit the commission of acts that violate a&para;<br>federal right on the mere suspicion that Congress acted&para;<br>beyond its authority. Because the suit must be assumed&para;<br>to vindicate the Supremacy Clause and poses no serious&para;<br>affront to state sovereignty in light of the options available&para;<br>to the State under the program, it may proceed.&para;<br>With these observations, I join the Court’s opinion.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Only after determining that&para;<br>Congress had not done so did the Court conclude that the&para;<br>suit could go forward under Ex parte Young.&para;<br>If Verizon’s formulation set forth the only requirements&para;<br>for bringing an action under Ex parte Young, two of our&para;<br>recent precedents were wrongly decided. In Seminole&para;<br>Tribe, the Court acknowledged that it had often “found&para;<br>federal jurisdiction over a suit against a state official when&para;<br>that suit seeks only prospective injunctive relief in order&para;<br>to end a continuing violation of federal law.” 517 U. S., at&para;<br>73 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court held,&para;<br>however, that the “situation presented” there was “suffi&para;<br>ciently different from that giving rise to the traditional Ex&para;<br>parte Young action so as to preclude the availability of&para;<br>that doctrine.” Ibid.2&para;<br>In Coeur d’Alene Tribe, the Court recognized that an&para;<br>“allegation of an ongoing violation of federal law where the&para;<br>requested relief is prospective is ordinarily sufficient to&para;<br>invoke the Young fiction.” 521 U.

In short, Seminole Tribe&para;<br>makes clear that a plaintiff who files a “complaint alleg[ing] an ongoing&para;<br>violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as&para;<br>prospective,” Verizon, 535 U.

Application of the&para;<br>Young exception must reflect a proper understanding&para;<br>of its role in our federal system and respect for state&para;<br>courts instead of a reflexive reliance on an obvious fic&para;<br>tion.” 521 U.

If this were a “traditional Ex&para;<br>parte Young action,” Seminole Tribe, supra, at 73, peti&para;<br>tioner might very well be able to pursue its claims under&para;<br>that case.

The Court is troubled by this novelty, ante&para;<br>at 12–13, but not enough. See Free Enterprise Fund v.&para;<br>Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2010) (slip op., at 25) (“Perhaps the most telling indi&para;<br>cation of [a] severe constitutional problem . . . is the lack of&para;<br>historical precedent” (internal quotation marks omitted));&para;<br>cf.

This is especially&para;<br>true in light of the “presumption” we articulated more&para;<br>than 120 years ago in Hans v.

See ante, at 12; see also ante,&para;<br>at 3–4 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Even if true, that sim&para;<br>ply highlights the fact that this case is not suitable for&para;<br>mere rote application of Ex parte Young.&para;<br>In addition to its novel character, petitioner’s complaint&para;<br>“conflicts directly with the principles of federalism that&para;<br>underlie the Eleventh Amendment.” Pennhurst, 465 U.

In Alden, we held that state sovereign immunity prohibited Congress from authorizing “private suits&para;<br>against nonconsenting States in their own courts.” 527&para;<br>U. S., at 749. We explained that such power would permit&para;<br>one branch of state government, the “State’s own courts,”&para;<br>“to coerce the other branches of the State” and “to turn the&para;<br>State against itself.” Ibid.&para;<br>Here the Court goes further: this suit features a state&para;<br>agency on one side, and state executive officials on the&para;<br>other. The objection in Alden was that the Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment could force the State to defend itself before itself.&para;<br>Here extending Young forces the State to defend itself&para;<br>against itself in federal court.&para;<br>Both sides in this case exercise the sovereign power of&para;<br>the Commonwealth of Virginia. Petitioner claims the title&para;<br>of “The Commonwealth of Virginia” in its complaint, App.&para;<br>10; respondents are state officials acting in an official&para;<br>capacity. Whatever the decision in the litigation, one&para;<br>thing is clear: The Commonwealth will win. And the&para;<br>Commonwealth will lose. Because of today’s holding, a&para;<br>federal judge will resolve which part of the Common&para;<br>wealth will prevail.&para;<br>Virginia has not consented to such a suit in federal&para;<br>court; rather, petitioner has unilaterally determined that&para;<br>this intramural dispute should be resolved in that forum.&para;<br>This is precisely what sovereign immunity is supposed to&para;<br>guard against. See ante, at 10 (“The specific indignity&para;<br>against which sovereign immunity protects is the insult to&para;<br>a State of being haled into court without its consent”).&para;<br>That indignity is compounded when the State is haled into&para;<br>federal court so that a federal judge can decide an internal&para;<br>state dispute.&para;<br>The Court is wrong to suggest that Virginia has no&para;<br>sovereign interest in determining where such disputes will&para;<br>be resolved.

Ante, at 8–9 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). The Court is correct that several of our prior&para;<br>cases have focused on the nature of the relief requested.&para;<br>See, e.g., Edelman, 415 U. S., at 664–671. That may well&para;<br>be because “the difference between the type of relief&para;<br>barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that permitted&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Sovereign immunity principles would of course not prohibit this&para;<br>Court from reviewing the federal questions presented by this suit if it&para;<br>had been filed in state court. See ante, at 11. We have held that “it is&para;<br>inherent in the constitutional plan that when a state court takes&para;<br>cognizance of a case, the State assents to appellate review by this Court&para;<br>of the federal issues raised in the case whoever may be the parties to&para;<br>the original suit, whether private persons, or the state itself.” McKes&para;<br>son Corp. v.

But the Court is&para;<br>wrong to draw a negative implication from those cases and&para;<br>categorically conclude that there can be no other basis for&para;<br>determining whether to extend Ex parte Young’s fiction.&para;<br>The thrust of the Court’s argument appears to be that,&para;<br>because the relief sought here is no different from that&para;<br>which could be sought in a suit by a private protection and&para;<br>advocacy system, the doctrine of Ex parte Young should&para;<br>also apply to a suit brought by a state system. Ante, at 7–&para;<br>9. But private entities are different from public ones:&para;<br>They are private. When private litigants are involved, the&para;<br>State is not turned against itself.&para;<br>Contrary to the Court’s suggestion, see ante, at 9, there&para;<br>is indeed a real difference between a suit against the State&para;<br>brought by a private party and one brought by a state&para;<br>agency. It is the difference between eating and cannibal&para;<br>ism; between murder and patricide. While the ultimate&para;<br>results may be the same—a full stomach and a dead&para;<br>body—it is the means of getting there that attracts notice.&para;<br>I would think it more an affront to someone’s dignity to be&para;<br>sued by a brother than to be sued by a stranger. While&para;<br>neither may be welcomed, that does not mean they would&para;<br>be equally received.&para;<br>The Court also contends that petitioner’s ability to sue&para;<br>state officials in federal court “is a consequence of Vir&para;<br>ginia’s own decision to establish a public [protection and&para;<br>advocacy] system.” Ibid. This cannot mean that Virginia&para;<br>has consented to an infringement on its sovereignty. That&para;<br>argument was rejected below, and petitioner did not seek&para;<br>certiorari on that issue. See Virginia v. Reinhard, 565&para;<br>F. 3d 110, 116–118 (CA4 2009); Pet. for Cert. i.&para;<br>Instead the Court claims that “Virginia has only itself to&para;<br>blame”—if it wanted to avoid its current predicament, it&para;<br>could have chosen to establish a private entity instead.&para;<br>Ante, at 9–10, and n. 5; see also ante, at 3 (KENNEDY, J.,&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY&para;<br>v. STEWART &para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>concurring). But I am aware of no doctrine to the effect&para;<br>that an unconstitutional establishment is insulated from&para;<br>challenge simply because a constitutional alternative is&para;<br>available. And here the public and private systems are&para;<br>not interchangeable alternatives in any event.&para;<br>The Court’s analysis is also circular; it wrongly assumes&para;<br>Virginia knew in advance the answer to the question&para;<br>presented in this case. Only after concluding that Ex parte&para;<br>Young applies to this arrangement—that for the first time&para;<br>in history a state agency may sue an unwilling State in&para;<br>federal court—can the Court suggest that Virginia know&para;<br>ingly exposed its officers to suit in federal court.&para;<br>In a similar vein, the Court asserts that because Vir&para;<br>ginia law authorizes petitioner to exercise independent&para;<br>litigating authority, petitioner should be treated the same&para;<br>“as any other litigant.” Ante, at 13. But petitioner is not&para;<br>like any other litigant. While it is true petitioner enjoys&para;<br>some independence from the State’s executive branch, that&para;<br>does not mean petitioner is independent from the State.&para;<br>As noted, petitioner certainly views itself as “The Com&para;<br>monwealth of Virginia,” App. 10, and would presumably&para;<br>invoke sovereign immunity itself if sued. As a matter of&para;<br>sovereign immunity law, it should make no difference how&para;<br>a State chooses to allocate its governmental powers among&para;<br>different state agencies or officials.&para;<br>The Court is wrong to suggest that simply because&para;<br>petitioner possesses independent litigating authority, it&para;<br>may sue state officials in federal court. See ante, at 13&para;<br>(“the Eleventh Amendment presents no obstacle” since it&para;<br>“was Virginia law that created [petitioner] and gave it the&para;<br>power to sue state officials”). There is more to this case&para;<br>than merely whether petitioner needs the approval of the&para;<br>Attorney General to sue, and the Virginia Code provisions&para;<br>cited by the Court say nothing about actions against the&para;<br>State in federal court.&para;<br>If independent litigating authority is all that it takes,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Reinhard, supra, at 124.&para;<br>There would be no Eleventh Amendment impediment to&para;<br>such suits. Given the number of state agencies across the&para;<br>country that enjoy independent litigating authority, see,&para;<br>e.g., Brief for State of Indiana et al. as Amici Curiae 11–&para;<br>13, the Court’s decision today could potentially lead to all&para;<br>sorts of litigation in federal courts addressing internal&para;<br>state government disputes.&para;<br>And there is also no reason to think that the Court’s&para;<br>holding is limited to state agency plaintiffs. According to&para;<br>the Court’s basic rationale, state officials who enjoy some&para;<br>level of independence could as a matter of federal law&para;<br>bring suit against other state officials in federal court.&para;<br>Disputes that were formerly resolved in state cabinet&para;<br>rooms may now appear on the dockets of federal courts.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>No one questions the continued vitality or importance of&para;<br>the doctrine announced in Ex parte Young.
