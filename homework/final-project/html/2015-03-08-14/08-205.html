FEDERAL ELECTION&para;<br>&para;<br>COMMISSION &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE&para;<br>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA&para;<br>No. 08–205.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 24, 2009—Reargued September 9, 2009––&para;<br>Decided January 21, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>As amended by §203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002&para;<br>(BCRA), federal law prohibits corporations and unions from using&para;<br>their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for&para;<br>speech that is an “electioneering communication” or for speech that&para;<br>expressly advocates the election or defeat of a candidate. 2 U. S. C.&para;<br>§441b. An electioneering communication is “any broadcast, cable, or&para;<br>satellite communication” that “refers to a clearly identified candidate&para;<br>for Federal office” and is made within 30 days of a primary election,&para;<br>§434(f)(3)(A), and that is “publicly distributed,” 11 CFR §100.29(a)(2),&para;<br>which in “the case of a candidate for nomination for President . . .&para;<br>means” that the communication “[c]an be received by 50,000 or more&para;<br>persons in a State where a primary election . . . is being held within&para;<br>30 days,” §100.29(b)(3)(ii). Corporations and unions may establish a&para;<br>political action committee (PAC) for express advocacy or electioneer&para;<br>ing communications purposes. 2 U. S. C. §441b(b)(2). In McConnell&para;<br>v. Federal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 203–209, this Court upheld&para;<br>limits on electioneering communications in a facial challenge, relying&para;<br>on the holding in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494&para;<br>U. S. 652, that political speech may be banned based on the speaker’s&para;<br>corporate identity.&para;<br>In January 2008, appellant Citizens United, a nonprofit corpora&para;<br>tion, released a documentary (hereinafter Hillary) critical of thenSenator Hillary Clinton, a candidate for her party’s Presidential&para;<br>nomination. Anticipating that it would make Hillary available on&para;<br>cable television through video-on-demand within 30 days of primary&para;<br>elections, Citizens United produced television ads to run on broadcast&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>and cable television. Concerned about possible civil and criminal&para;<br>penalties for violating §441b, it sought declaratory and injunctive re&para;<br>lief, arguing that (1) §441b is unconstitutional as applied to Hillary;&para;<br>and (2) BCRA’s disclaimer, disclosure, and reporting requirements,&para;<br>BCRA §§201 and 311, were unconstitutional as applied to Hillary&para;<br>and the ads. The District Court denied Citizens United a prelimi&para;<br>nary injunction and granted appellee Federal Election Commission&para;<br>(FEC) summary judgment.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Because the question whether §441b applies to Hillary cannot be&para;<br>resolved on other, narrower grounds without chilling political speech,&para;<br>this Court must consider the continuing effect of the speech suppres&para;<br>sion upheld in Austin. Pp. 5–20.&para;<br>(a) Citizen United’s narrower arguments—that Hillary is not an&para;<br>“electioneering communication” covered by §441b because it is not&para;<br>“publicly distributed” under 11 CFR §100.29(a)(2); that §441b may&para;<br>not be applied to Hillary under Federal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin&para;<br>Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449 (WRTL), which found §441b uncon&para;<br>stitutional as applied to speech that was not “express advocacy or its&para;<br>functional equivalent,” id., at 481 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), deter&para;<br>mining that a communication “is the functional equivalent of express&para;<br>advocacy only if [it] is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation&para;<br>other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,”&para;<br>id., at 469–470; that §441b should be invalidated as applied to movies&para;<br>shown through video-on-demand because this delivery system has a&para;<br>lower risk of distorting the political process than do television ads;&para;<br>and that there should be an exception to §441b’s ban for nonprofit&para;<br>corporate political speech funded overwhelming by individuals—are&para;<br>not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute. Pp. 5–12.&para;<br>(b) Thus, this case cannot be resolved on a narrower ground&para;<br>without chilling political speech, speech that is central to the First&para;<br>Amendment’s meaning and purpose. Citizens United did not waive&para;<br>this challenge to Austin when it stipulated to dismissing the facial&para;<br>challenge below, since (1) even if such a challenge could be waived,&para;<br>this Court may reconsider Austin and §441b’s facial validity here be&para;<br>cause the District Court “passed upon” the issue, Lebron v. National&para;<br>Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 379; (2) throughout&para;<br>the litigation, Citizens United has asserted a claim that the FEC has&para;<br>violated its right to free speech; and (3) the parties cannot enter into&para;<br>a stipulation that prevents the Court from considering remedies nec&para;<br>essary to resolve a claim that has been preserved. Because Citizen&para;<br>United’s narrower arguments are not sustainable, this Court must, in&para;<br>an exercise of its judicial responsibility, consider §441b’s facial valid&para;<br>ity. Any other course would prolong the substantial, nationwide&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>chilling effect caused by §441b’s corporate expenditure ban. This&para;<br>conclusion is further supported by the following: (1) the uncertainty&para;<br>caused by the Government’s litigating position; (2) substantial time&para;<br>would be required to clarify §441b’s application on the points raised&para;<br>by the Government’s position in order to avoid any chilling effect&para;<br>caused by an improper interpretation; and (3) because speech itself is&para;<br>of primary importance to the integrity of the election process, any&para;<br>speech arguably within the reach of rules created for regulating po&para;<br>litical speech is chilled. The regulatory scheme at issue may not be a&para;<br>prior restraint in the strict sense. However, given its complexity and&para;<br>the deference courts show to administrative determinations, a&para;<br>speaker wishing to avoid criminal liability threats and the heavy&para;<br>costs of defending against FEC enforcement must ask a governmen&para;<br>tal agency for prior permission to speak. The restrictions thus func&para;<br>tion as the equivalent of a prior restraint, giving the FEC power&para;<br>analogous to the type of government practices that the First Amend&para;<br>ment was drawn to prohibit. The ongoing chill on speech makes it&para;<br>necessary to invoke the earlier precedents that a statute that chills&para;<br>speech can and must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has&para;<br>been demonstrated. Pp. 12–20.&para;<br>2. Austin is overruled, and thus provides no basis for allowing the&para;<br>Government to limit corporate independent expenditures. Hence,&para;<br>§441b’s restrictions on such expenditures are invalid and cannot be&para;<br>applied to Hillary. Given this conclusion, the part of McConnell that&para;<br>upheld BCRA §203’s extension of §441b’s restrictions on independent&para;<br>corporate expenditures is also overruled. Pp. 20–51.&para;<br>(a) Although the First Amendment provides that “Congress shall&para;<br>make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech,” §441b’s prohibition&para;<br>on corporate independent expenditures is an outright ban on speech,&para;<br>backed by criminal sanctions. It is a ban notwithstanding the fact&para;<br>that a PAC created by a corporation can still speak, for a PAC is a&para;<br>separate association from the corporation. Because speech is an es&para;<br>sential mechanism of democracy—it is the means to hold officials ac&para;<br>countable to the people—political speech must prevail against laws&para;<br>that would suppress it by design or inadvertence. Laws burdening&para;<br>such speech are subject to strict scrutiny, which requires the Gov&para;<br>ernment to prove that the restriction “furthers a compelling interest&para;<br>and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.” WRTL, 551 U. S.,&para;<br>at 464. This language provides a sufficient framework for protecting&para;<br>the interests in this case. Premised on mistrust of governmental&para;<br>power, the First Amendment stands against attempts to disfavor cer&para;<br>tain subjects or viewpoints or to distinguish among different speak&para;<br>ers, which may be a means to control content. The Government may&para;<br>also commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>preferred speakers. There is no basis for the proposition that, in the&para;<br>political speech context, the Government may impose restrictions on&para;<br>certain disfavored speakers. Both history and logic lead to this con&para;<br>clusion. Pp. 20–25.&para;<br>(b) The Court has recognized that the First Amendment applies&para;<br>to corporations, e.g., First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S.&para;<br>765, 778, n. 14, and extended this protection to the context of political&para;<br>speech, see, e.g., NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 428–429. Address&para;<br>ing challenges to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, the&para;<br>Buckley Court upheld limits on direct contributions to candidates, 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §608(b), recognizing a governmental interest in preventing&para;<br>quid pro quo corruption. 424 U. S., at 25–26. However, the Court in&para;<br>validated §608(e)’s expenditure ban, which applied to individuals,&para;<br>corporations, and unions, because it “fail[ed] to serve any substantial&para;<br>governmental interest in stemming the reality or appearance of cor&para;<br>ruption in the electoral process,” id., at 47–48. While Buckley did not&para;<br>consider a separate ban on corporate and union independent expendi&para;<br>tures found in §610, had that provision been challenged in Buckley’s&para;<br>wake, it could not have been squared with the precedent’s reasoning&para;<br>and analysis. The Buckley Court did not invoke the overbreadth doc&para;<br>trine to suggest that §608(e)’s expenditure ban would have been con&para;<br>stitutional had it applied to corporations and unions but not indi&para;<br>viduals. Notwithstanding this precedent, Congress soon recodified&para;<br>§610’s corporate and union expenditure ban at 2 U. S. C. §441b, the&para;<br>provision at issue. Less than two years after Buckley, Bellotti reaf&para;<br>firmed the First Amendment principle that the Government lacks the&para;<br>power to restrict political speech based on the speaker’s corporate&para;<br>identity. 435 U.S., at 784–785. Thus the law stood until Austin up&para;<br>held a corporate independent expenditure restriction, bypassing&para;<br>Buckley and Bellotti by recognizing a new governmental interest in&para;<br>preventing “the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggrega&para;<br>tions of [corporate] wealth . . . that have little or no correlation to the&para;<br>public’s support for the corporation’s political ideas.” 494 U. S., at&para;<br>660. Pp. 25–32.&para;<br>(c) This Court is confronted with conflicting lines of precedent: a&para;<br>pre-Austin line forbidding speech restrictions based on the speaker’s&para;<br>corporate identity and a post-Austin line permitting them. Neither&para;<br>Austin’s antidistortion rationale nor the Government’s other justifica&para;<br>tions support §441b’s restrictions. Pp. 32–47.&para;<br>(1) The First Amendment prohibits Congress from fining or&para;<br>jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for engaging in political&para;<br>speech, but Austin’s antidistortion rationale would permit the Gov&para;<br>ernment to ban political speech because the speaker is an association&para;<br>with a corporate form. Political speech is “indispensable to decision&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>making in a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech&para;<br>comes from a corporation.” Bellotti, supra, at 777 (footnote omitted).&para;<br>This protection is inconsistent with Austin’s rationale, which is&para;<br>meant to prevent corporations from obtaining “ ‘an unfair advantage&para;<br>in the political marketplace’ ” by using “ ‘resources amassed in the&para;<br>economic marketplace.’ ” 494 U. S., at 659. First Amendment protec&para;<br>tions do not depend on the speaker’s “financial ability to engage in&para;<br>public discussion.” Buckley, supra, at 49. These conclusions were re&para;<br>affirmed when the Court invalidated a BCRA provision that in&para;<br>creased the cap on contributions to one candidate if the opponent&para;<br>made certain expenditures from personal funds. Davis v. Federal&para;<br>Election Comm’n, 554 U. S. ___, ___. Distinguishing wealthy indi&para;<br>viduals from corporations based on the latter’s special advantages of,&para;<br>e.g., limited liability, does not suffice to allow laws prohibiting&para;<br>speech. It is irrelevant for First Amendment purposes that corporate&para;<br>funds may “have little or no correlation to the public’s support for the&para;<br>corporation’s political ideas.” Austin, supra, at 660. All speakers, in&para;<br>cluding individuals and the media, use money amassed from the eco&para;<br>nomic marketplace to fund their speech, and the First Amendment&para;<br>protects the resulting speech. Under the antidistortion rationale,&para;<br>Congress could also ban political speech of media corporations. Al&para;<br>though currently exempt from §441b, they accumulate wealth with&para;<br>the help of their corporate form, may have aggregations of wealth,&para;<br>and may express views “hav[ing] little or no correlation to the public’s&para;<br>support” for those views. Differential treatment of media corpora&para;<br>tions and other corporations cannot be squared with the First&para;<br>Amendment, and there is no support for the view that the Amend&para;<br>ment’s original meaning would permit suppressing media corpora&para;<br>tions’ political speech. Austin interferes with the “open marketplace”&para;<br>of ideas protected by the First Amendment. New York State Bd. of&para;<br>Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U. S. 196, 208. Its censorship is vast in&para;<br>its reach, suppressing the speech of both for-profit and nonprofit,&para;<br>both small and large, corporations. Pp. 32–40.&para;<br>(2) This reasoning also shows the invalidity of the Govern&para;<br>ment’s other arguments. It reasons that corporate political speech&para;<br>can be banned to prevent corruption or its appearance. The Buckley&para;<br>Court found this rationale “sufficiently important” to allow contribu&para;<br>tion limits but refused to extend that reasoning to expenditure limits,&para;<br>424 U.S., at 25, and the Court does not do so here. While a single&para;<br>Bellotti footnote purported to leave the question open, 435 U. S., at&para;<br>788, n. 26, this Court now concludes that independent expenditures,&para;<br>including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption&para;<br>or the appearance of corruption. That speakers may have influence&para;<br>over or access to elected officials does not mean that those officials&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>are corrupt. And the appearance of influence or access will not cause&para;<br>the electorate to lose faith in this democracy. Caperton v. A. T.&para;<br>Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___, distinguished. Pp. 40–45.&para;<br>(3) The Government’s asserted interest in protecting share&para;<br>holders from being compelled to fund corporate speech, like the anti&para;<br>distortion rationale, would allow the Government to ban political&para;<br>speech even of media corporations. The statute is underinclusive; it&para;<br>only protects a dissenting shareholder’s interests in certain media for&para;<br>30 or 60 days before an election when such interests would be impli&para;<br>cated in any media at any time. It is also overinclusive because it&para;<br>covers all corporations, including those with one shareholder. P. 46.&para;<br>(4) Because §441b is not limited to corporations or associa&para;<br>tions created in foreign countries or funded predominately by foreign&para;<br>shareholders, it would be overbroad even if the Court were to recog&para;<br>nize a compelling governmental interest in limiting foreign influence&para;<br>over the Nation’s political process. Pp. 46–47.&para;<br>(d) The relevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to stare&para;<br>decisis, beyond workability—the precedent’s antiquity, the reliance&para;<br>interests at stake, and whether the decision was well reasoned—&para;<br>counsel in favor of abandoning Austin, which itself contravened the&para;<br>precedents of Buckley and Bellotti. As already explained, Austin was&para;<br>not well reasoned. It is also undermined by experience since its an&para;<br>nouncement. Political speech is so ingrained in this country’s culture&para;<br>that speakers find ways around campaign finance laws. Rapid&para;<br>changes in technology—and the creative dynamic inherent in the&para;<br>concept of free expression—counsel against upholding a law that re&para;<br>stricts political speech in certain media or by certain speakers. In&para;<br>addition, no serious reliance issues are at stake. Thus, due consid&para;<br>eration leads to the conclusion that Austin should be overruled. The&para;<br>Court returns to the principle established in Buckley and Bellotti that&para;<br>the Government may not suppress political speech based on the&para;<br>speaker’s corporate identity. No sufficient governmental interest jus&para;<br>tifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corpora&para;<br>tions. Pp. 47–50.&para;<br>3. BCRA §§201 and 311 are valid as applied to the ads for Hillary&para;<br>and to the movie itself. Pp. 50–57.&para;<br>(a) Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the abil&para;<br>ity to speak, but they “impose no ceiling on campaign-related activi&para;<br>ties,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 64, or “ ‘ “prevent anyone from speak&para;<br>ing,” ’ ” McConnell, supra, at 201. The Buckley Court explained that&para;<br>disclosure can be justified by a governmental interest in providing&para;<br>“the electorate with information” about election-related spending&para;<br>sources. The McConnell Court applied this interest in rejecting facial&para;<br>challenges to §§201 and 311. 540 U. S., at 196. However, the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>acknowledged that as-applied challenges would be available if a&para;<br>group could show a “ ‘reasonable probability’ ” that disclosing its con&para;<br>tributors’ names would “ ‘subject them to threats, harassment, or re&para;<br>prisals from either Government officials or private parties.’ ” Id., at&para;<br>198. Pp. 50–52.&para;<br>(b) The disclaimer and disclosure requirements are valid as ap&para;<br>plied to Citizens United’s ads. They fall within BCRA’s “electioneer&para;<br>ing communication” definition: They referred to then-Senator Clinton&para;<br>by name shortly before a primary and contained pejorative references&para;<br>to her candidacy. Section 311 disclaimers provide information to the&para;<br>electorate, McConnell, supra, at 196, and “insure that the voters are&para;<br>fully informed” about who is speaking, Buckley, supra, at 76. At the&para;<br>very least, they avoid confusion by making clear that the ads are not&para;<br>funded by a candidate or political party. Citizens United’s arguments&para;<br>that §311 is underinclusive because it requires disclaimers for broad&para;<br>cast advertisements but not for print or Internet advertising and that&para;<br>§311 decreases the quantity and effectiveness of the group’s speech&para;<br>were rejected in McConnell. This Court also rejects their contention&para;<br>that §201’s disclosure requirements must be confined to speech that&para;<br>is the functional equivalent of express advocacy under WRTL’s test&para;<br>for restrictions on independent expenditures, 551 U. S., at 469–476&para;<br>(opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.). Disclosure is the less-restrictive alterna&para;<br>tive to more comprehensive speech regulations. Such requirements&para;<br>have been upheld in Buckley and McConnell. Citizens United’s ar&para;<br>gument that no informational interest justifies applying §201 to its&para;<br>ads is similar to the argument this Court rejected with regard to dis&para;<br>claimers. Citizens United finally claims that disclosure requirements&para;<br>can chill donations by exposing donors to retaliation, but offers no&para;<br>evidence that its members face the type of threats, harassment, or&para;<br>reprisals that might make §201 unconstitutional as applied. Pp. 52–&para;<br>55.&para;<br>(c) For these same reasons, this Court affirms the application of&para;<br>the §§201 and 311 disclaimer and disclosure requirements to Hillary.&para;<br>Pp. 55–56.&para;<br>Reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded.&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

S. C. §441b. Limits&para;<br>on electioneering communications were upheld in McCon&para;<br>nell v. Federal Election Comm’n, 540 U. S. 93, 203–209&para;<br>(2003). The holding of McConnell rested to a large extent&para;<br>on an earlier case, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Com&para;<br>merce, 494 U. S. 652 (1990). Austin had held that political&para;<br>speech may be banned based on the speaker’s corporate&para;<br>identity.&para;<br>In this case we are asked to reconsider Austin and, in&para;<br>effect, McConnell. It has been noted that “Austin was a&para;<br>significant departure from ancient First Amendment&para;<br>principles,” Federal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to&para;<br>Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449, 490 (2007) (WRTL) (SCALIA, J.,&para;<br>concurring in part and concurring in judgment). We agree&para;<br>with that conclusion and hold that stare decisis does not&para;<br>compel the continued acceptance of Austin. The Govern&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ment may regulate corporate political speech through&para;<br>disclaimer and disclosure requirements, but it may not&para;<br>suppress that speech altogether. We turn to the case now&para;<br>before us.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Citizens United is a nonprofit corporation. It brought&para;<br>this action in the United States District Court for the&para;<br>District of Columbia. A three-judge court later convened&para;<br>to hear the cause. The resulting judgment gives rise to&para;<br>this appeal.&para;<br>Citizens United has an annual budget of about $12&para;<br>million. Most of its funds are from donations by individu&para;<br>als; but, in addition, it accepts a small portion of its funds&para;<br>from for-profit corporations.&para;<br>In January 2008, Citizens United released a film enti&para;<br>tled Hillary: The Movie. We refer to the film as Hillary. It&para;<br>is a 90-minute documentary about then-Senator Hillary&para;<br>Clinton, who was a candidate in the Democratic Party’s&para;<br>2008 Presidential primary elections. Hillary mentions&para;<br>Senator Clinton by name and depicts interviews with&para;<br>political commentators and other persons, most of them&para;<br>quite critical of Senator Clinton. Hillary was released in&para;<br>theaters and on DVD, but Citizens United wanted to&para;<br>increase distribution by making it available through video&para;<br>on-demand.&para;<br>Video-on-demand allows digital cable subscribers to&para;<br>select programming from various menus, including mov&para;<br>ies, television shows, sports, news, and music. The viewer&para;<br>can watch the program at any time and can elect to re&para;<br>wind or pause the program. In December 2007, a cable&para;<br>company offered, for a payment of $1.2 million, to make&para;<br>Hillary available on a video-on-demand channel called&para;<br>“Elections ’08.” App. 255a–257a.

Each ad includes a short (and, in our view,&para;<br>pejorative) statement about Senator Clinton, followed by&para;<br>the name of the movie and the movie’s Website address.&para;<br>Id., at 26a–27a. Citizens United desired to promote the&para;<br>video-on-demand offering by running advertisements on&para;<br>broadcast and cable television.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Before the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002&para;<br>(BCRA), federal law prohibited—and still does prohibit—&para;<br>corporations and unions from using general treasury&para;<br>funds to make direct contributions to candidates or inde&para;<br>pendent expenditures that expressly advocate the election&para;<br>or defeat of a candidate, through any form of media, in&para;<br>connection with certain qualified federal elections. 2&para;<br>U.

S. 238, 249 (1986) (MCFL).&para;<br>BCRA §203 amended §441b to prohibit any “electioneering&para;<br>communication” as well. 2 U. S. C. §441b(b)(2) (2006 ed.).&para;<br>An electioneering communication is defined as “any broad&para;<br>cast, cable, or satellite communication” that “refers to a&para;<br>clearly identified candidate for Federal office” and is made&para;<br>within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general elec&para;<br>tion. §434(f)(3)(A). The Federal Election Commission’s&para;<br>(FEC) regulations further define an electioneering com&para;<br>munication as a communication that is “publicly distrib&para;<br>uted.” 11 CFR §100.29(a)(2) (2009). “In the case of a&para;<br>candidate for nomination for President . . . publicly dis&para;<br>tributed means” that the communication “[c]an be received&para;<br>by 50,000 or more persons in a State where a primary&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>election . . . is being held within 30 days.”&para;<br>§100.29(b)(3)(ii). Corporations and unions are barred from&para;<br>using their general treasury funds for express advocacy or&para;<br>electioneering communications.&para;<br>They may establish,&para;<br>however, a “separate segregated fund” (known as a politi&para;<br>cal action committee, or PAC) for these purposes. 2&para;<br>U. S. C. §441b(b)(2). The moneys received by the segre&para;<br>gated fund are limited to donations from stockholders and&para;<br>employees of the corporation or, in the case of unions,&para;<br>members of the union. Ibid.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Citizens United wanted to make Hillary available&para;<br>through video-on-demand within 30 days of the 2008&para;<br>primary elections. It feared, however, that both the film&para;<br>and the ads would be covered by §441b’s ban on corporate&para;<br>funded independent expenditures, thus subjecting the&para;<br>corporation to civil and criminal penalties under §437g. In&para;<br>December 2007, Citizens United sought declaratory and&para;<br>injunctive relief against the FEC. It argued that (1) §441b&para;<br>is unconstitutional as applied to Hillary; and (2) BCRA’s&para;<br>disclaimer and disclosure requirements, BCRA §§201 and&para;<br>311, are unconstitutional as applied to Hillary and to the&para;<br>three ads for the movie.&para;<br>The District Court denied Citizens United’s motion for a&para;<br>preliminary injunction, 530 F. Supp. 2d 274 (DC 2008)&para;<br>(per curiam), and then granted the FEC’s motion for&para;<br>summary judgment, App. 261a–262a. See id., at 261a&para;<br>(“Based on the reasoning of our prior opinion, we find that&para;<br>the [FEC] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See&para;<br>Citizen[s] United v. FEC, 530 F. Supp. 2d 274 (D.D.C.&para;<br>2008) (denying Citizens United’s request for a preliminary&para;<br>injunction)”). The court held that §441b was facially&para;<br>constitutional under McConnell, and that §441b was&para;<br>constitutional as applied to Hillary because it was “sus&para;<br>ceptible of no other interpretation than to inform the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>electorate that Senator Clinton is unfit for office, that the&para;<br>United States would be a dangerous place in a President&para;<br>Hillary Clinton world, and that viewers should vote&para;<br>against her.” 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 279. The court also&para;<br>rejected Citizens United’s challenge to BCRA’s disclaimer&para;<br>and disclosure requirements. It noted that “the Supreme&para;<br>Court has written approvingly of disclosure provisions&para;<br>triggered by political speech even though the speech itself&para;<br>was constitutionally protected under the First Amend&para;<br>ment.” Id., at 281.&para;<br>We noted probable jurisdiction. 555 U.

S. C.&para;<br>§441b. See 557 U. S. ___ (2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Before considering whether Austin should be overruled,&para;<br>we first address whether Citizens United’s claim that&para;<br>§441b cannot be applied to Hillary may be resolved on&para;<br>other, narrower grounds.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Citizens United contends that §441b does not cover&para;<br>Hillary, as a matter of statutory interpretation, because&para;<br>the film does not qualify as an “electioneering communica&para;<br>tion.” §441b(b)(2). Citizens United raises this issue for&para;<br>the first time before us, but we consider the issue because&para;<br>“it was addressed by the court below.” Lebron v. National&para;<br>Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 379 (1995);&para;<br>see 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 277, n. 6. Under the definition of&para;<br>electioneering communication, the video-on-demand show&para;<br>ing of Hillary on cable television would have been a “cable&para;<br>. . . communication” that “refer[red] to a clearly identified&para;<br>candidate for Federal office” and that was made within 30&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>days of a primary election. 2 U. S. C. §434(f)(3)(A)(i).&para;<br>Citizens United, however, argues that Hillary was not&para;<br>“publicly distributed,” because a single video-on-demand&para;<br>transmission is sent only to a requesting cable converter&para;<br>box and each separate transmission, in most instances,&para;<br>will be seen by just one household—not 50,000 or more&para;<br>persons. 11 CFR §100.29(a)(2); see §100.29(b)(3)(ii).&para;<br>This argument ignores the regulation’s instruction on&para;<br>how to determine whether a cable transmission “[c]an be&para;<br>received by 50,000 or more persons.” §100.29(b)(3)(ii).&para;<br>The regulation provides that the number of people who&para;<br>can receive a cable transmission is determined by the&para;<br>number of cable subscribers in the relevant area.&para;<br>§§100.29(b)(7)(i)(G), (ii). Here, Citizens United wanted to&para;<br>use a cable video-on-demand system that had 34.5 million&para;<br>subscribers nationwide. App. 256a. Thus, Hillary could&para;<br>have been received by 50,000 persons or more.&para;<br>One amici brief asks us, alternatively, to construe the&para;<br>condition that the communication “[c]an be received by&para;<br>50,000 or more persons,” §100.29(b)(3)(ii)(A), to require “a&para;<br>plausible likelihood that the communication will be viewed&para;<br>by 50,000 or more potential voters”—as opposed to requir&para;<br>ing only that the communication is “technologically capa&para;<br>ble” of being seen by that many people, Brief for Former&para;<br>Officials of the American Civil Liberties Union as Amici&para;<br>Curiae 5. Whether the population and demographic sta&para;<br>tistics in a proposed viewing area consisted of 50,000&para;<br>registered voters—but not “infants, pre-teens, or otherwise&para;<br>electorally ineligible recipients”—would be a required&para;<br>determination, subject to judicial challenge and review, in&para;<br>any case where the issue was in doubt. Id., at 6.&para;<br>In our view the statute cannot be saved by limiting the&para;<br>reach of 2 U. S. C. §441b through this suggested interpre&para;<br>tation. In addition to the costs and burdens of litigation,&para;<br>this result would require a calculation as to the number of&para;<br>people a particular communication is likely to reach, with&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>an inaccurate estimate potentially subjecting the speaker&para;<br>to criminal sanctions. The First Amendment does not&para;<br>permit laws that force speakers to retain a campaign&para;<br>finance attorney, conduct demographic marketing re&para;<br>search, or seek declaratory rulings before discussing the&para;<br>most salient political issues of our day. Prolix laws chill&para;<br>speech for the same reason that vague laws chill speech:&para;<br>People “of common intelligence must necessarily guess at&para;<br>[the law’s] meaning and differ as to its application.” Con&para;<br>nally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385, 391 (1926).&para;<br>The Government may not render a ban on political speech&para;<br>constitutional by carving out a limited exemption through&para;<br>an amorphous regulatory interpretation. We must reject&para;<br>the approach suggested by the amici. Section 441b covers&para;<br>Hillary.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Citizens United next argues that §441b may not be&para;<br>applied to Hillary under the approach taken in WRTL.&para;<br>McConnell decided that §441b(b)(2)’s definition of an&para;<br>“electioneering communication” was facially constitutional&para;<br>insofar as it restricted speech that was “the functional&para;<br>equivalent of express advocacy” for or against a specific&para;<br>candidate. 540 U. S., at 206. WRTL then found an uncon&para;<br>stitutional application of §441b where the speech was not&para;<br>“express advocacy or its functional equivalent.” 551 U. S.,&para;<br>at 481 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). As explained by THE&para;<br>CHIEF JUSTICE’s controlling opinion in WRTL, the func&para;<br>tional-equivalent test is objective: “a court should find that&para;<br>[a communication] is the functional equivalent of express&para;<br>advocacy only if [it] is susceptible of no reasonable inter&para;<br>pretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a&para;<br>specific candidate.” Id., at 469–470.&para;<br>Under this test, Hillary is equivalent to express advo&para;<br>cacy. The movie, in essence, is a feature-length negative&para;<br>advertisement that urges viewers to vote against Senator&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Clinton for President. In light of historical footage, inter&para;<br>views with persons critical of her, and voiceover narration,&para;<br>the film would be understood by most viewers as an ex&para;<br>tended criticism of Senator Clinton’s character and her&para;<br>fitness for the office of the Presidency. The narrative may&para;<br>contain more suggestions and arguments than facts, but&para;<br>there is little doubt that the thesis of the film is that she is&para;<br>unfit for the Presidency. The movie concentrates on al&para;<br>leged wrongdoing during the Clinton administration,&para;<br>Senator Clinton’s qualifications and fitness for office, and&para;<br>policies the commentators predict she would pursue if&para;<br>elected President. It calls Senator Clinton “Machiavel&para;<br>lian,” App. 64a, and asks whether she is “the most quali&para;<br>fied to hit the ground running if elected President,” id., at&para;<br>88a. The narrator reminds viewers that “Americans have&para;<br>never been keen on dynasties” and that “a vote for Hillary&para;<br>is a vote to continue 20 years of a Bush or a Clinton in the&para;<br>White House,” id., at 143a–144a.&para;<br>Citizens United argues that Hillary is just “a documen&para;<br>tary film that examines certain historical events.” Brief&para;<br>for Appellant 35. We disagree. The movie’s consistent&para;<br>emphasis is on the relevance of these events to Senator&para;<br>Clinton’s candidacy for President. The narrator begins by&para;<br>asking “could [Senator Clinton] become the first female&para;<br>President in the history of the United States?” App. 35a.&para;<br>And the narrator reiterates the movie’s message in his&para;<br>closing line: “Finally, before America decides on our next&para;<br>president, voters should need no reminders of . . . what’s&para;<br>at stake—the well being and prosperity of our nation.”&para;<br>Id., at 144a–145a.&para;<br>As the District Court found, there is no reasonable&para;<br>interpretation of Hillary other than as an appeal to vote&para;<br>against Senator Clinton. Under the standard stated in&para;<br>McConnell and further elaborated in WRTL, the film&para;<br>qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010) &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>C&para;<br>&para;<br>Citizens United further contends that §441b should be&para;<br>invalidated as applied to movies shown through video-on&para;<br>demand, arguing that this delivery system has a lower&para;<br>risk of distorting the political process than do television&para;<br>ads. Cf. McConnell, supra, at 207. On what we might call&para;<br>conventional television, advertising spots reach viewers&para;<br>who have chosen a channel or a program for reasons unre&para;<br>lated to the advertising. With video-on-demand, by con&para;<br>trast, the viewer selects a program after taking “a series of&para;<br>affirmative steps”: subscribing to cable; navigating&para;<br>through various menus; and selecting the program. See&para;<br>Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 867&para;<br>(1997).&para;<br>While some means of communication may be less effec&para;<br>tive than others at influencing the public in different&para;<br>contexts, any effort by the Judiciary to decide which&para;<br>means of communications are to be preferred for the par&para;<br>ticular type of message and speaker would raise questions&para;<br>as to the courts’ own lawful authority. Substantial ques&para;<br>tions would arise if courts were to begin saying what&para;<br>means of speech should be preferred or disfavored. And in&para;<br>all events, those differentiations might soon prove to be&para;<br>irrelevant or outdated by technologies that are in rapid&para;<br>flux. See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512&para;<br>U. S. 622, 639 (1994).&para;<br>Courts, too, are bound by the First Amendment. We&para;<br>must decline to draw, and then redraw, constitutional&para;<br>lines based on the particular media or technology used to&para;<br>disseminate political speech from a particular speaker. It&para;<br>must be noted, moreover, that this undertaking would&para;<br>require substantial litigation over an extended time, all to&para;<br>interpret a law that beyond doubt discloses serious First&para;<br>Amendment flaws. The interpretive process itself would&para;<br>create an inevitable, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling&para;<br>protected speech pending the drawing of fine distinctions&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that, in the end, would themselves be questionable. First&para;<br>Amendment standards, however, “must give the benefit of&para;<br>any doubt to protecting rather than stifling speech.”&para;<br>WRTL, 551 U. S., at 469 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (citing&para;<br>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 269–270&para;<br>(1964)).&para;<br>D&para;<br>Citizens United also asks us to carve out an exception to&para;<br>§441b’s expenditure ban for nonprofit corporate political&para;<br>speech funded overwhelmingly by individuals. As an&para;<br>alternative to reconsidering Austin, the Government also&para;<br>seems to prefer this approach. This line of analysis, how&para;<br>ever, would be unavailing.&para;<br>In MCFL, the Court found unconstitutional §441b’s&para;<br>restrictions on corporate expenditures as applied to non&para;<br>profit corporations that were formed for the sole purpose&para;<br>of promoting political ideas, did not engage in business&para;<br>activities, and did not accept contributions from for-profit&para;<br>corporations or labor unions. 479 U. S., at 263–264; see&para;<br>also 11 CFR §114.10. BCRA’s so-called Wellstone Amend&para;<br>ment applied §441b’s expenditure ban to all nonprofit&para;<br>corporations. See 2 U. S. C. §441b(c)(6); McConnell, 540&para;<br>U. S., at 209. McConnell then interpreted the Wellstone&para;<br>Amendment to retain the MCFL exemption to §441b’s&para;<br>expenditure prohibition. 540 U. S., at 211. Citizens&para;<br>United does not qualify for the MCFL exemption, however,&para;<br>since some funds used to make the movie were donations&para;<br>from for-profit corporations.&para;<br>The Government suggests we could find BCRA’s&para;<br>Wellstone Amendment unconstitutional, sever it from the&para;<br>statute, and hold that Citizens United’s speech is exempt&para;<br>from §441b’s ban under BCRA’s Snowe-Jeffords Amend&para;<br>ment, §441b(c)(2). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37–38 (Sept. 9,&para;<br>2009). The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment operates as a&para;<br>backup provision that only takes effect if the Wellstone&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Amendment is invalidated. See McConnell, supra, at 339&para;<br>(KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissent&para;<br>ing in part). The Snowe-Jeffords Amendment would ex&para;<br>empt from §441b’s expenditure ban the political speech of&para;<br>certain nonprofit corporations if the speech were funded&para;<br>“exclusively” by individual donors and the funds were&para;<br>maintained in a segregated account. §441b(c)(2). Citizens&para;<br>United would not qualify for the Snowe-Jeffords exemp&para;<br>tion, under its terms as written, because Hillary was&para;<br>funded in part with donations from for-profit corporations.&para;<br>Consequently, to hold for Citizens United on this argu&para;<br>ment, the Court would be required to revise the text of&para;<br>MCFL, sever BCRA’s Wellstone Amendment, §441b(c)(6),&para;<br>and ignore the plain text of BCRA’s Snowe-Jeffords&para;<br>Amendment, §441b(c)(2). If the Court decided to create a&para;<br>de minimis exception to MCFL or the Snowe-Jeffords&para;<br>Amendment, the result would be to allow for-profit corpo&para;<br>rate general treasury funds to be spent for independent&para;<br>expenditures that support candidates. There is no princi&para;<br>pled basis for doing this without rewriting Austin’s hold&para;<br>ing that the Government can restrict corporate independ&para;<br>ent expenditures for political speech.&para;<br>Though it is true that the Court should construe stat&para;<br>utes as necessary to avoid constitutional questions, the&para;<br>series of steps suggested would be difficult to take in view&para;<br>of the language of the statute. In addition to those diffi&para;<br>culties the Government’s suggestion is troubling for still&para;<br>another reason. The Government does not say that it&para;<br>agrees with the interpretation it wants us to consider. See&para;<br>Supp. Brief for Appellee 3, n. 1 (“Some courts” have im&para;<br>plied a de minimis exception, and “appellant would appear&para;<br>to be covered by these decisions”). Presumably it would&para;<br>find textual difficulties in this approach too. The Govern&para;<br>ment, like any party, can make arguments in the alterna&para;<br>tive; but it ought to say if there is merit to an alternative&para;<br>proposal instead of merely suggesting it. This is especially&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>true in the context of the First Amendment. As the Gov&para;<br>ernment stated, this case “would require a remand” to&para;<br>apply a de minimis standard. Tr. of Oral Arg. 39 (Sept. 9,&para;<br>2009). Applying this standard would thus require case-by&para;<br>case determinations. But archetypical political speech&para;<br>would be chilled in the meantime. “ ‘First Amendment&para;<br>freedoms need breathing space to survive.’ ” WRTL, supra,&para;<br>at 468–469 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (quoting NAACP v.&para;<br>Button, 371 U. S. 415, 433 (1963)). We decline to adopt an&para;<br>interpretation that requires intricate case-by-case deter&para;<br>minations to verify whether political speech is banned,&para;<br>especially if we are convinced that, in the end, this corpo&para;<br>ration has a constitutional right to speak on this subject.&para;<br>E&para;<br>As the foregoing analysis confirms, the Court cannot&para;<br>resolve this case on a narrower ground without chilling&para;<br>political speech, speech that is central to the meaning and&para;<br>purpose of the First Amendment. See Morse v. Frederick,&para;<br>551 U. S. 393, 403 (2007). It is not judicial restraint to&para;<br>accept an unsound, narrow argument just so the Court can&para;<br>avoid another argument with broader implications. In&para;<br>deed, a court would be remiss in performing its duties&para;<br>were it to accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the&para;<br>necessity of making a broader ruling. Here, the lack of a&para;<br>valid basis for an alternative ruling requires full consid&para;<br>eration of the continuing effect of the speech suppression&para;<br>upheld in Austin.&para;<br>Citizens United stipulated to dismissing count 5 of its&para;<br>complaint, which raised a facial challenge to §441b, even&para;<br>though count 3 raised an as-applied challenge. See App.&para;<br>23a (count 3: “As applied to Hillary, [§441b] is unconstitu&para;<br>tional under the First Amendment guarantees of free&para;<br>expression and association”). The Government argues&para;<br>that Citizens United waived its challenge to Austin by&para;<br>dismissing count 5. We disagree.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>First, even if a party could somehow waive a facial&para;<br>challenge while preserving an as-applied challenge, that&para;<br>would not prevent the Court from reconsidering Austin or&para;<br>addressing the facial validity of §441b in this case. “Our&para;<br>practice ‘permit[s] review of an issue not pressed [below]&para;<br>so long as it has been passed upon . . . .’ ” Lebron, 513&para;<br>U. S., at 379 (quoting United States v. Williams, 504 U. S.&para;<br>36, 41 (1992); first alteration in original). And here, the&para;<br>District Court addressed Citizens United’s facial chal&para;<br>lenge. See 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 278 (“Citizens wants us to&para;<br>enjoin the operation of BCRA §203 as a facially unconsti&para;<br>tutional burden on the First Amendment right to freedom&para;<br>of speech”). In rejecting the claim, it noted that it “would&para;<br>have to overrule McConnell” for Citizens United to prevail&para;<br>on its facial challenge and that “[o]nly the Supreme Court&para;<br>may overrule its decisions.” Ibid. (citing Rodriguez de&para;<br>Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477,&para;<br>484 (1989)). The District Court did not provide much&para;<br>analysis regarding the facial challenge because it could&para;<br>not ignore the controlling Supreme Court decisions in&para;<br>Austin or McConnell. Even so, the District Court did&para;<br>“ ‘pas[s] upon’ ” the issue. Lebron, supra, at 379. Fur&para;<br>thermore, the District Court’s later opinion, which granted&para;<br>the FEC summary judgment, was “[b]ased on the reason&para;<br>ing of [its] prior opinion,” which included the discussion of&para;<br>the facial challenge. App. 261a (citing 530 F. Supp. 2d&para;<br>274). After the District Court addressed the facial validity&para;<br>of the statute, Citizens United raised its challenge to&para;<br>Austin in this Court. See Brief for Appellant 30 (“Austin&para;<br>was wrongly decided and should be overruled”); id., at 30–&para;<br>32. In these circumstances, it is necessary to consider&para;<br>Citizens United’s challenge to Austin and the facial valid&para;<br>ity of §441b’s expenditure ban.&para;<br>Second, throughout the litigation, Citizens United has&para;<br>asserted a claim that the FEC has violated its First&para;<br>Amendment right to free speech. All concede that this&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>claim is properly before us. And “ ‘[o]nce a federal claim is&para;<br>properly presented, a party can make any argument in&para;<br>support of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise&para;<br>arguments they made below.’ ” Lebron, supra, at 379&para;<br>(quoting Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 534 (1992);&para;<br>alteration in original). Citizens United’s argument that&para;<br>Austin should be overruled is “not a new claim.” Lebron,&para;<br>513 U. S., at 379. Rather, it is—at most—“a new argu&para;<br>ment to support what has been [a] consistent claim: that&para;<br>[the FEC] did not accord [Citizens United] the rights it&para;<br>was obliged to provide by the First Amendment.” Ibid.&para;<br>Third, the distinction between facial and as-applied&para;<br>challenges is not so well defined that it has some auto&para;<br>matic effect or that it must always control the pleadings&para;<br>and disposition in every case involving a constitutional&para;<br>challenge. The distinction is both instructive and neces&para;<br>sary, for it goes to the breadth of the remedy employed by&para;<br>the Court, not what must be pleaded in a complaint. See&para;<br>United States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S. 454, 477–&para;<br>478 (1995) (contrasting “a facial challenge” with “a nar&para;<br>rower remedy”). The parties cannot enter into a stipula&para;<br>tion that prevents the Court from considering certain&para;<br>remedies if those remedies are necessary to resolve a claim&para;<br>that has been preserved. Citizens United has preserved&para;<br>its First Amendment challenge to §441b as applied to the&para;<br>facts of its case; and given all the circumstances, we can&para;<br>not easily address that issue without assuming a prem&para;<br>ise—the permissibility of restricting corporate political&para;<br>speech—that is itself in doubt. See Fallon, As-Applied and&para;<br>Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv.&para;<br>L. Rev. 1321, 1339 (2000) (“[O]nce a case is brought, no&para;<br>general categorical line bars a court from making broader&para;<br>pronouncements of invalidity in properly ‘as-applied’&para;<br>cases”); id., at 1327–1328. As our request for supplemen&para;<br>tal briefing implied, Citizens United’s claim implicates the&para;<br>validity of Austin, which in turn implicates the facial&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>validity of §441b.&para;<br>When the statute now at issue came before the Court in&para;<br>McConnell, both the majority and the dissenting opinions&para;<br>considered the question of its facial validity. The holding&para;<br>and validity of Austin were essential to the reasoning of&para;<br>the McConnell majority opinion, which upheld BCRA’s&para;<br>extension of §441b. See 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting Austin,&para;<br>494 U. S., at 660). McConnell permitted federal felony&para;<br>punishment for speech by all corporations, including&para;<br>nonprofit ones, that speak on prohibited subjects shortly&para;<br>before federal elections. See 540 U. S., at 203–209. Four&para;<br>Members of the McConnell Court would have overruled&para;<br>Austin, including Chief Justice Rehnquist, who had joined&para;<br>the Court’s opinion in Austin but reconsidered that conclu&para;<br>sion. See 540 U. S., at 256–262 (SCALIA, J., concurring in&para;<br>part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in&para;<br>part); id., at 273–275 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part,&para;<br>concurring in result in part, concurring in judgment in&para;<br>part, and dissenting in part); id., at 322–338 (opinion of&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and SCALIA, J.).&para;<br>That inquiry into the facial validity of the statute was&para;<br>facilitated by the extensive record, which was “over&para;<br>100,000 pages” long, made in the three-judge District&para;<br>Court.&para;<br>McConnell v. Federal Election Comm’n, 251&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 176, 209 (DC 2003) (per curiam) (McConnell&para;<br>I). It is not the case, then, that the Court today is prema&para;<br>ture in interpreting §441b “ ‘on the basis of [a] factually&para;<br>barebones recor[d].’ ” Washington State Grange v. Wash&para;<br>ington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 450 (2008)&para;<br>(quoting Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S. 600, 609 (2004)).&para;<br>The McConnell majority considered whether the statute&para;<br>was facially invalid. An as-applied challenge was brought&para;<br>in Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Federal Election&para;<br>Comm’n, 546 U. S. 410, 411–412 (2006) (per curiam), and&para;<br>the Court confirmed that the challenge could be main&para;<br>tained. Then, in WRTL, the controlling opinion of the&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Court not only entertained an as-applied challenge but&para;<br>also sustained it. Three Justices noted that they would&para;<br>continue to maintain the position that the record in&para;<br>McConnell demonstrated the invalidity of the Act on its&para;<br>face. 551 U. S., at 485–504 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The&para;<br>controlling opinion in WRTL, which refrained from hold&para;<br>ing the statute invalid except as applied to the facts then&para;<br>before the Court, was a careful attempt to accept the&para;<br>essential elements of the Court’s opinion in McConnell,&para;<br>while vindicating the First Amendment arguments made&para;<br>by the WRTL parties. 551 U. S., at 482 (opinion of&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J.).&para;<br>As noted above, Citizens United’s narrower arguments&para;<br>are not sustainable under a fair reading of the statute. In&para;<br>the exercise of its judicial responsibility, it is necessary&para;<br>then for the Court to consider the facial validity of §441b.&para;<br>Any other course of decision would prolong the substan&para;<br>tial, nation-wide chilling effect caused by §441b’s prohibi&para;<br>tions on corporate expenditures. Consideration of the&para;<br>facial validity of §441b is further supported by the follow&para;<br>ing reasons.&para;<br>First is the uncertainty caused by the litigating position&para;<br>of the Government. As discussed above, see Part II–D,&para;<br>supra, the Government suggests, as an alternative argu&para;<br>ment, that an as-applied challenge might have merit.&para;<br>This argument proceeds on the premise that the nonprofit&para;<br>corporation involved here may have received only de&para;<br>minimis donations from for-profit corporations and that&para;<br>some nonprofit corporations may be exempted from the&para;<br>operation of the statute. The Government also suggests&para;<br>that an as-applied challenge to §441b’s ban on books may&para;<br>be successful, although it would defend §441b’s ban as&para;<br>applied to almost every other form of media including&para;<br>pamphlets. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 65–66 (Sept. 9, 2009).&para;<br>The Government thus, by its own position, contributes to&para;<br>the uncertainty that §441b causes. When the Government&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>holds out the possibility of ruling for Citizens United on a&para;<br>narrow ground yet refrains from adopting that position,&para;<br>the added uncertainty demonstrates the necessity to&para;<br>address the question of statutory validity.&para;<br>Second, substantial time would be required to bring&para;<br>clarity to the application of the statutory provision on&para;<br>these points in order to avoid any chilling effect caused by&para;<br>some improper interpretation. See Part II–C, supra. It is&para;<br>well known that the public begins to concentrate on elec&para;<br>tions only in the weeks immediately before they are held.&para;<br>There are short timeframes in which speech can have&para;<br>influence. The need or relevance of the speech will often&para;<br>first be apparent at this stage in the campaign. The deci&para;<br>sion to speak is made in the heat of political campaigns,&para;<br>when speakers react to messages conveyed by others. A&para;<br>speaker’s ability to engage in political speech that could&para;<br>have a chance of persuading voters is stifled if the speaker&para;<br>must first commence a protracted lawsuit. By the time&para;<br>the lawsuit concludes, the election will be over and the&para;<br>litigants in most cases will have neither the incentive nor,&para;<br>perhaps, the resources to carry on, even if they could&para;<br>establish that the case is not moot because the issue is&para;<br>“capable of repetition, yet evading review.” WRTL, supra,&para;<br>at 462 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (citing Los Angeles v.&para;<br>Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 109 (1983); Southern Pacific Terminal&para;<br>Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S. 498, 515 (1911)). Here, Citizens&para;<br>United decided to litigate its case to the end. Today,&para;<br>Citizens United finally learns, two years after the fact,&para;<br>whether it could have spoken during the 2008 Presidential&para;<br>primary—long after the opportunity to persuade primary&para;<br>voters has passed.&para;<br>Third is the primary importance of speech itself to the&para;<br>integrity of the election process. As additional rules are&para;<br>created for regulating political speech, any speech argua&para;<br>bly within their reach is chilled. See Part II–A, supra.&para;<br>Campaign finance regulations now impose “unique and&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>complex rules” on “71 distinct entities.” Brief for Seven&para;<br>Former Chairmen of FEC et al. as Amici Curiae 11–12.&para;<br>These entities are subject to separate rules for 33 different&para;<br>types of political speech. Id., at 14–15, n. 10. The FEC&para;<br>has adopted 568 pages of regulations, 1,278 pages of ex&para;<br>planations and justifications for those regulations, and&para;<br>1,771 advisory opinions since 1975. See id., at 6, n. 7. In&para;<br>fact, after this Court in WRTL adopted an objective “ap&para;<br>peal to vote” test for determining whether a communica&para;<br>tion was the functional equivalent of express advocacy,&para;<br>551 U. S., at 470 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), the FEC&para;<br>adopted a two-part, 11-factor balancing test to implement&para;<br>WRTL’s ruling. See 11 CFR §114.15; Brief for Wyoming&para;<br>Liberty Group et al. as Amici Curiae 17–27 (filed Jan. 15,&para;<br>2009).&para;<br>This regulatory scheme may not be a prior restraint on&para;<br>speech in the strict sense of that term, for prospective&para;<br>speakers are not compelled by law to seek an advisory&para;<br>opinion from the FEC before the speech takes place. Cf.&para;<br>Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697, 712–713&para;<br>(1931). As a practical matter, however, given the complex&para;<br>ity of the regulations and the deference courts show to&para;<br>administrative determinations, a speaker who wants to&para;<br>avoid threats of criminal liability and the heavy costs of&para;<br>defending against FEC enforcement must ask a govern&para;<br>mental agency for prior permission to speak. See 2&para;<br>U. S. C. §437f; 11 CFR §112.1. These onerous restrictions&para;<br>thus function as the equivalent of prior restraint by giving&para;<br>the FEC power analogous to licensing laws implemented&para;<br>in 16th- and 17th-century England, laws and governmen&para;<br>tal practices of the sort that the First Amendment was&para;<br>drawn to prohibit. See Thomas v. Chicago Park Dist., 534&para;<br>U. S. 316, 320 (2002); Lovell v. City of Griffin, 303 U. S.&para;<br>444, 451–452 (1938); Near, supra, at 713–714. Because&para;<br>the FEC’s “business is to censor, there inheres the danger&para;<br>that [it] may well be less responsive than a court—part of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>an independent branch of government—to the constitu&para;<br>tionally protected interests in free expression.” Freedman&para;<br>v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, 57–58 (1965). When the FEC&para;<br>issues advisory opinions that prohibit speech, “[m]any&para;<br>persons, rather than undertake the considerable burden&para;<br>(and sometimes risk) of vindicating their rights through&para;<br>case-by-case litigation, will choose simply to abstain from&para;<br>protected speech—harming not only themselves but soci&para;<br>ety as a whole, which is deprived of an uninhibited mar&para;<br>ketplace of ideas.” Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U. S. 113, 119&para;<br>(2003) (citation omitted). Consequently, “the censor’s&para;<br>determination may in practice be final.” Freedman, supra,&para;<br>at 58.&para;<br>This is precisely what WRTL sought to avoid. WRTL&para;<br>said that First Amendment standards “must eschew ‘the&para;<br>open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors,’ which ‘invit[es]&para;<br>complex argument in a trial court and a virtually inevita&para;<br>ble appeal.’ ” 551 U. S., at 469 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.)&para;<br>(quoting Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge &amp;&para;<br>Dock Co., 513 U. S. 527, 547 (1995); alteration in original).&para;<br>Yet, the FEC has created a regime that allows it to select&para;<br>what political speech is safe for public consumption by&para;<br>applying ambiguous tests. If parties want to avoid litiga&para;<br>tion and the possibility of civil and criminal penalties, they&para;<br>must either refrain from speaking or ask the FEC to issue&para;<br>an advisory opinion approving of the political speech in&para;<br>question. Government officials pore over each word of a&para;<br>text to see if, in their judgment, it accords with the 11&para;<br>factor test they have promulgated. This is an unprece&para;<br>dented governmental intervention into the realm of&para;<br>speech.&para;<br>The ongoing chill upon speech that is beyond all doubt&para;<br>protected makes it necessary in this case to invoke the&para;<br>earlier precedents that a statute which chills speech can&para;<br>and must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has&para;<br>been demonstrated. See WRTL, supra, at 482–483 (ALITO,&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>J., concurring); Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 97–98&para;<br>(1940). For these reasons we find it necessary to recon&para;<br>sider Austin.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall&para;<br>make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” Laws&para;<br>enacted to control or suppress speech may operate at&para;<br>different points in the speech process. The following are&para;<br>just a few examples of restrictions that have been at&para;<br>tempted at different stages of the speech process—all laws&para;<br>found to be invalid: restrictions requiring a permit at the&para;<br>outset, Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v.&para;<br>Village of Stratton, 536 U. S. 150, 153 (2002); imposing a&para;<br>burden by impounding proceeds on receipts or royalties,&para;<br>Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime&para;<br>Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 108, 123 (1991); seeking to&para;<br>exact a cost after the speech occurs, New York Times Co. v.&para;<br>Sullivan, 376 U. S., at 267; and subjecting the speaker to&para;<br>criminal penalties, Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444,&para;<br>445 (1969) (per curiam).&para;<br>The law before us is an outright ban, backed by criminal&para;<br>sanctions. Section 441b makes it a felony for all corpora&para;<br>tions—including nonprofit advocacy corporations—either&para;<br>to expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates&para;<br>or to broadcast electioneering communications within 30&para;<br>days of a primary election and 60 days of a general elec&para;<br>tion. Thus, the following acts would all be felonies under&para;<br>§441b: The Sierra Club runs an ad, within the crucial&para;<br>phase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts&para;<br>the public to disapprove of a Congressman who favors&para;<br>logging in national forests; the National Rifle Association&para;<br>publishes a book urging the public to vote for the chal&para;<br>lenger because the incumbent U. S. Senator supports a&para;<br>handgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union&para;<br>creates a Web site telling the public to vote for a Presiden&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tial candidate in light of that candidate’s defense of&para;<br>free speech. These prohibitions are classic examples of&para;<br>censorship.&para;<br>Section 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstand&para;<br>ing the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can still&para;<br>speak. See McConnell, 540 U. S., at 330–333 (opinion of&para;<br>KENNEDY, J.). A PAC is a separate association from the&para;<br>corporation. So the PAC exemption from §441b’s expendi&para;<br>ture ban, §441b(b)(2), does not allow corporations to speak.&para;<br>Even if a PAC could somehow allow a corporation to&para;<br>speak—and it does not—the option to form PACs does not&para;<br>alleviate the First Amendment problems with §441b.&para;<br>PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to&para;<br>administer and subject to extensive regulations. For&para;<br>example, every PAC must appoint a treasurer, forward&para;<br>donations to the treasurer promptly, keep detailed records&para;<br>of the identities of the persons making donations, preserve&para;<br>receipts for three years, and file an organization statement&para;<br>and report changes to this information within 10 days.&para;<br>See id., at 330–332 (quoting MCFL, 479 U. S., at 253–&para;<br>254).&para;<br>And that is just the beginning. PACs must file detailed&para;<br>monthly reports with the FEC, which are due at different&para;<br>times depending on the type of election that is about to&para;<br>occur:&para;<br>“ ‘These reports must contain information regarding&para;<br>the amount of cash on hand; the total amount of re&para;<br>ceipts, detailed by 10 different categories; the identifi&para;<br>cation of each political committee and candidate’s au&para;<br>thorized or affiliated committee making contributions,&para;<br>and any persons making loans, providing rebates, re&para;<br>funds, dividends, or interest or any other offset to op&para;<br>erating expenditures in an aggregate amount over&para;<br>$200; the total amount of all disbursements, detailed&para;<br>by 12 different categories; the names of all authorized&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>or affiliated committees to whom expenditures aggre&para;<br>gating over $200 have been made; persons to whom&para;<br>loan repayments or refunds have been made; the total&para;<br>sum of all contributions, operating expenses, out&para;<br>standing debts and obligations, and the settlement&para;<br>terms of the retirement of any debt or obligation.’ ”&para;<br>540 U. S., at 331–332 (quoting MCFL, supra, at 253–&para;<br>254).&para;<br>PACs have to comply with these regulations just to&para;<br>speak. This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the&para;<br>millions of corporations in this country have PACs.&para;<br>See Brief for Seven Former Chairmen of FEC et al. as&para;<br>Amici Curiae 11 (citing FEC, Summary of PAC Activity&para;<br>1990–2006, online at http://www.fec.gov/press/press2007/&para;<br>20071009pac/sumhistory.pdf); IRS, Statistics of Income:&para;<br>2006, Corporation Income Tax Returns 2 (2009) (hereinaf&para;<br>ter Statistics of Income) (5.8 million for-profit corporations&para;<br>filed 2006 tax returns). PACs, furthermore, must exist&para;<br>before they can speak. Given the onerous restrictions, a&para;<br>corporation may not be able to establish a PAC in time to&para;<br>make its views known regarding candidates and issues in&para;<br>a current campaign.&para;<br>Section 441b’s prohibition on corporate independent&para;<br>expenditures is thus a ban on speech. As a “restriction on&para;<br>the amount of money a person or group can spend on&para;<br>political communication during a campaign,” that statute&para;<br>“necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restrict&para;<br>ing the number of issues discussed, the depth of their&para;<br>exploration, and the size of the audience reached.” Buck&para;<br>ley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 19 (1976) (per curiam). Were the&para;<br>Court to uphold these restrictions, the Government could&para;<br>repress speech by silencing certain voices at any of the&para;<br>various points in the speech process. See McConnell,&para;<br>supra, at 251 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (Government could&para;<br>repress speech by “attacking all levels of the production&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and dissemination of ideas,” for “effective public communi&para;<br>cation requires the speaker to make use of the services of&para;<br>others”). If §441b applied to individuals, no one would&para;<br>believe that it is merely a time, place, or manner restric&para;<br>tion on speech. Its purpose and effect are to silence enti&para;<br>ties whose voices the Government deems to be suspect.&para;<br>Speech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is&para;<br>the means to hold officials accountable to the people. See&para;<br>Buckley, supra, at 14–15 (“In a republic where the people&para;<br>are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed&para;<br>choices among candidates for office is essential”). The&para;<br>right of citizens to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use&para;<br>information to reach consensus is a precondition to&para;<br>enlightened self-government and a necessary means to&para;<br>protect it. The First Amendment “ ‘has its fullest and most&para;<br>urgent application’ to speech uttered during a campaign&para;<br>for political office.” Eu v. San Francisco County Democ&para;<br>ratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 223 (1989) (quoting&para;<br>Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U. S. 265, 272 (1971)); see&para;<br>Buckley, supra, at 14 (“Discussion of public issues and&para;<br>debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to&para;<br>the operation of the system of government established by&para;<br>our Constitution”).&para;<br>For these reasons, political speech must prevail against&para;<br>laws that would suppress it, whether by design or inadver&para;<br>tence. Laws that burden political speech are “subject to&para;<br>strict scrutiny,” which requires the Government to prove&para;<br>that the restriction “furthers a compelling interest and is&para;<br>narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.” WRTL, 551&para;<br>U. S., at 464 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). While it might&para;<br>be maintained that political speech simply cannot be&para;<br>banned or restricted as a categorical matter, see Simon &amp;&para;<br>Schuster, 502 U. S., at 124 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in&para;<br>judgment), the quoted language from WRTL provides a&para;<br>sufficient framework for protecting the relevant First&para;<br>Amendment interests in this case. We shall employ it&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>here.&para;<br>Premised on mistrust of governmental power, the First&para;<br>Amendment stands against attempts to disfavor certain&para;<br>subjects or viewpoints. See, e.g., United States v. Playboy&para;<br>Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 813 (2000)&para;<br>(striking down content-based restriction). Prohibited, too,&para;<br>are restrictions distinguishing among different speakers,&para;<br>allowing speech by some but not others. See First Nat.&para;<br>Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 784 (1978). As&para;<br>instruments to censor, these categories are interrelated:&para;<br>Speech restrictions based on the identity of the speaker&para;<br>are all too often simply a means to control content.&para;<br>Quite apart from the purpose or effect of regulating&para;<br>content, moreover, the Government may commit a consti&para;<br>tutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred&para;<br>speakers. By taking the right to speak from some and&para;<br>giving it to others, the Government deprives the disadvan&para;<br>taged person or class of the right to use speech to strive to&para;<br>establish worth, standing, and respect for the speaker’s&para;<br>voice. The Government may not by these means deprive&para;<br>the public of the right and privilege to determine for itself&para;<br>what speech and speakers are worthy of consideration.&para;<br>The First Amendment protects speech and speaker, and&para;<br>the ideas that flow from each.&para;<br>The Court has upheld a narrow class of speech restric&para;<br>tions that operate to the disadvantage of certain persons,&para;<br>but these rulings were based on an interest in allowing&para;<br>governmental entities to perform their functions. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U. S. 675, 683&para;<br>(1986) (protecting the “function of public school educa&para;<br>tion”); Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union,&para;<br>Inc., 433 U. S. 119, 129 (1977) (furthering “the legitimate&para;<br>penological objectives of the corrections system” (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted)); Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733,&para;<br>759 (1974) (ensuring “the capacity of the Government to&para;<br>discharge its [military] responsibilities” (internal quota&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tion marks omitted)); Civil Service Comm’n v. Letter Car&para;<br>riers, 413 U. S. 548, 557 (1973) (“[F]ederal service should&para;<br>depend upon meritorious performance rather than politi&para;<br>cal service”). The corporate independent expenditures at&para;<br>issue in this case, however, would not interfere with gov&para;<br>ernmental functions, so these cases are inapposite. These&para;<br>precedents stand only for the proposition that there are&para;<br>certain governmental functions that cannot operate with&para;<br>out some restrictions on particular kinds of speech. By&para;<br>contrast, it is inherent in the nature of the political proc&para;<br>ess that voters must be free to obtain information from&para;<br>diverse sources in order to determine how to cast their&para;<br>votes. At least before Austin, the Court had not allowed&para;<br>the exclusion of a class of speakers from the general public&para;<br>dialogue.&para;<br>We find no basis for the proposition that, in the context&para;<br>of political speech, the Government may impose restric&para;<br>tions on certain disfavored speakers. Both history and&para;<br>logic lead us to this conclusion.&para;<br>A&para;<br>1&para;<br>The Court has recognized that First Amendment protec&para;<br>tion extends to corporations.

American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233,&para;<br>244 (1936). Under the rationale of these precedents,&para;<br>political speech does not lose First Amendment protection&para;<br>“simply because its source is a corporation.” Bellotti,&para;<br>supra, at 784; see Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Public Util.&para;<br>Comm’n of Cal., 475 U. S. 1, 8 (1986) (plurality opinion)&para;<br>(“The identity of the speaker is not decisive in determining&para;<br>whether speech is protected.

S., at 783)). The Court has thus rejected the&para;<br>argument that political speech of corporations or other&para;<br>associations should be treated differently under the First&para;<br>Amendment simply because such associations are not&para;<br>“natural persons.” Id., at 776; see id., at 780, n. 16.

See&para;<br>B. Smith, Unfree Speech: The Folly of Campaign Finance&para;<br>Reform 23 (2001). Yet not until 1947 did Congress first&para;<br>prohibit independent expenditures by corporations and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

R.&para;<br>Doc. No. 334, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 9 (1947).&para;<br>For almost three decades thereafter, the Court did not&para;<br>reach the question whether restrictions on corporate and&para;<br>union expenditures are constitutional. See WRTL, 551&para;<br>U. S., at 502 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The question was in&para;<br>the background of United States v. CIO, 335 U. S. 106&para;<br>(1948). There, a labor union endorsed a congressional&para;<br>candidate in its weekly periodical. The Court stated that&para;<br>“the gravest doubt would arise in our minds as to [the&para;<br>federal expenditure prohibition’s] constitutionality” if it&para;<br>were construed to suppress that writing. Id., at 121. The&para;<br>Court engaged in statutory interpretation and found the&para;<br>statute did not cover the publication. Id., at 121–122, and&para;<br>n. 20. Four Justices, however, said they would reach the&para;<br>constitutional question and invalidate the Labor Man&para;<br>agement Relations Act’s expenditure ban. Id., at 155&para;<br>(Rutledge, J., joined by Black, Douglas, and Murphy, JJ.,&para;<br>concurring in result). The concurrence explained that any&para;<br>“ ‘undue influence’ ” generated by a speaker’s “large expen&para;<br>ditures” was outweighed “by the loss for democratic proc&para;<br>esses resulting from the restrictions upon free and full&para;<br>public discussion.” Id., at 143.&para;<br>In United States v. Automobile Workers, 352 U. S. 567&para;<br>(1957), the Court again encountered the independent&para;<br>expenditure ban, which had been recodified at 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§610 (1952 ed.). See 62 Stat. 723–724. After holding only&para;<br>that a union television broadcast that endorsed candidates&para;<br>was covered by the statute, the Court “[r]efus[ed] to an&para;<br>ticipate constitutional questions” and remanded for the&para;<br>trial to proceed. 352 U. S., at 591. Three Justices dis&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sented, arguing that the Court should have reached the&para;<br>constitutional question and that the ban on independent&para;<br>expenditures was unconstitutional:&para;<br>“Under our Constitution it is We The People who&para;<br>are sovereign. The people have the final say. The leg&para;<br>islators are their spokesmen. The people determine&para;<br>through their votes the destiny of the nation. It is&para;<br>therefore important—vitally important—that all&para;<br>channels of communications be open to them during&para;<br>every election, that no point of view be restrained or&para;<br>barred, and that the people have access to the views of&para;<br>every group in the community.” Id., at 593 (opinion of&para;<br>Douglas, J., joined by Warren, C. J., and Black, J.).&para;<br>The dissent concluded that deeming a particular group&para;<br>“too powerful” was not a “justificatio[n] for withholding&para;<br>First Amendment rights from any group—labor or corpo&para;<br>rate.” Id., at 597. The Court did not get another opportu&para;<br>nity to consider the constitutional question in that case;&para;<br>for after a remand, a jury found the defendants not guilty.&para;<br>See Hayward, Revisiting the Fable of Reform, 45 Harv. J.&para;<br>Legis. 421, 463 (2008).&para;<br>Later, in Pipefitters v. United States, 407 U. S. 385, 400–&para;<br>401 (1972), the Court reversed a conviction for expendi&para;<br>ture of union funds for political speech—again without&para;<br>reaching the constitutional question. The Court would not&para;<br>resolve that question for another four years.&para;<br>2&para;<br>In Buckley, 424 U. S. 1, the Court addressed various&para;<br>challenges to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971&para;<br>(FECA) as amended in 1974. These amendments created&para;<br>18 U. S. C. §608(e) (1970 ed., Supp. V), see 88 Stat. 1265,&para;<br>an independent expenditure ban separate from §610 that&para;<br>applied to individuals as well as corporations and labor&para;<br>unions, Buckley, 424 U.

S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>29&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Before addressing the constitutionality of §608(e)’s&para;<br>independent expenditure ban, Buckley first upheld&para;<br>§608(b), FECA’s limits on direct contributions to candi&para;<br>dates. The Buckley Court recognized a “sufficiently impor&para;<br>tant” governmental interest in “the prevention of corrup&para;<br>tion and the appearance of corruption.” Id., at 25; see id.,&para;<br>at 26. This followed from the Court’s concern that large&para;<br>contributions could be given “to secure a political quid pro&para;<br>quo.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Buckley Court explained that the potential for quid&para;<br>pro quo corruption distinguished direct contributions to&para;<br>candidates from independent expenditures. The Court&para;<br>emphasized that “the independent expenditure ceiling . . .&para;<br>fails to serve any substantial governmental interest in&para;<br>stemming the reality or appearance of corruption in the&para;<br>electoral process,” id., at 47–48, because “[t]he absence of&para;<br>prearrangement and coordination . . . alleviates the dan&para;<br>ger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for&para;<br>improper commitments from the candidate,” id., at 47.&para;<br>Buckley invalidated §608(e)’s restrictions on independent&para;<br>expenditures, with only one Justice dissenting. See Fed&para;<br>eral Election Comm’n v. National Conservative Political&para;<br>Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 491, n. 3 (1985) (NCPAC).&para;<br>Buckley did not consider §610’s separate ban on corpo&para;<br>rate and union independent expenditures, the prohibition&para;<br>that had also been in the background in CIO, Automobile&para;<br>Workers, and Pipefitters. Had §610 been challenged in the&para;<br>wake of Buckley, however, it could not have been squared&para;<br>with the reasoning and analysis of that precedent. See&para;<br>WRTL, supra, at 487 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (“Buckley&para;<br>might well have been the last word on limitations on&para;<br>independent expenditures”); Austin, 494 U. S., at 683&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., dissenting). The expenditure ban invalidated&para;<br>in Buckley, §608(e), applied to corporations and unions,&para;<br>424 U. S., at 23, 39, n. 45; and some of the prevailing&para;<br>plaintiffs in Buckley were corporations, id., at 8. The&para;<br>&para;<br>30&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Buckley Court did not invoke the First Amendment’s&para;<br>overbreadth doctrine, see Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413&para;<br>U. S. 601, 615 (1973), to suggest that §608(e)’s expenditure&para;<br>ban would have been constitutional if it had applied only&para;<br>to corporations and not to individuals, 424 U. S., at 50.&para;<br>Buckley cited with approval the Automobile Workers dis&para;<br>sent, which argued that §610 was unconstitutional. 424&para;<br>U. S., at 43 (citing 352 U. S., at 595–596 (opinion of Doug&para;<br>las, J.)).&para;<br>Notwithstanding this precedent, Congress recodified&para;<br>§610’s corporate and union expenditure ban at 2 U. S. C.&para;<br>§441b four months after Buckley was decided. See 90 Stat.&para;<br>490. Section 441b is the independent expenditure restric&para;<br>tion challenged here.&para;<br>Less than two years after Buckley, Bellotti, 435 U. S.&para;<br>765, reaffirmed the First Amendment principle that the&para;<br>Government cannot restrict political speech based on the&para;<br>speaker’s corporate identity. Bellotti could not have been&para;<br>clearer when it struck down a state-law prohibition on&para;<br>corporate independent expenditures related to referenda&para;<br>issues:&para;<br>“We thus find no support in the First . . . Amend&para;<br>ment, or in the decisions of this Court, for the proposi&para;<br>tion that speech that otherwise would be within the&para;<br>protection of the First Amendment loses that protec&para;<br>tion simply because its source is a corporation that&para;<br>cannot prove, to the satisfaction of a court, a material&para;<br>effect on its business or property. . . . [That proposi&para;<br>tion] amounts to an impermissible legislative prohibi&para;<br>tion of speech based on the identity of the interests&para;<br>that spokesmen may represent in public debate over&para;<br>controversial issues and a requirement that the&para;<br>speaker have a sufficiently great interest in the sub&para;<br>ject to justify communication.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>31&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“In the realm of protected speech, the legislature is&para;<br>constitutionally disqualified from dictating the sub&para;<br>jects about which persons may speak and the speak&para;<br>ers who may address a public issue.” Id., at 784–785.&para;<br>It is important to note that the reasoning and holding of&para;<br>Bellotti did not rest on the existence of a viewpoint&para;<br>discriminatory statute. It rested on the principle that the&para;<br>Government lacks the power to ban corporations from&para;<br>speaking.&para;<br>Bellotti did not address the constitutionality of the&para;<br>State’s ban on corporate independent expenditures to&para;<br>support candidates. In our view, however, that restriction&para;<br>would have been unconstitutional under Bellotti’s central&para;<br>principle: that the First Amendment does not allow politi&para;<br>cal speech restrictions based on a speaker’s corporate&para;<br>identity. See ibid.&para;<br>3&para;<br>Thus the law stood until Austin. Austin “uph[eld] a&para;<br>direct restriction on the independent expenditure of funds&para;<br>for political speech for the first time in [this Court’s] his&para;<br>tory.” 494 U. S., at 695 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). There,&para;<br>the Michigan Chamber of Commerce sought to use general&para;<br>treasury funds to run a newspaper ad supporting a spe&para;<br>cific candidate. Michigan law, however, prohibited corpo&para;<br>rate independent expenditures that supported or opposed&para;<br>any candidate for state office. A violation of the law was&para;<br>punishable as a felony. The Court sustained the speech&para;<br>prohibition.&para;<br>To bypass Buckley and Bellotti, the Austin Court identi&para;<br>fied a new governmental interest in limiting political&para;<br>speech: an antidistortion interest. Austin found a compel&para;<br>ling governmental interest in preventing “the corrosive&para;<br>and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth&para;<br>that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form&para;<br>and that have little or no correlation to the public’s sup&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>port for the corporation’s political ideas.” 494 U. S., at&para;<br>660; see id., at 659 (citing MCFL, 479 U. S., at 257;&para;<br>NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 500–501).&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Court is thus confronted with conflicting lines of&para;<br>precedent: a pre-Austin line that forbids restrictions on&para;<br>political speech based on the speaker’s corporate identity&para;<br>and a post-Austin line that permits them. No case before&para;<br>Austin had held that Congress could prohibit independent&para;<br>expenditures for political speech based on the speaker’s&para;<br>corporate identity. Before Austin Congress had enacted&para;<br>legislation for this purpose, and the Government urged the&para;<br>same proposition before this Court. See MCFL, supra, at&para;<br>257 (FEC posited that Congress intended to “curb the&para;<br>political influence of ‘those who exercise control over large&para;<br>aggregations of capital’ ” (quoting Automobile Workers,&para;<br>supra, at 585)); California Medical Assn. v. Federal Elec&para;<br>tion Comm’n, 453 U. S. 182, 201 (1981) (Congress believed&para;<br>that “differing structures and purposes” of corporations&para;<br>and unions “may require different forms of regulation in&para;<br>order to protect the integrity of the electoral process”). In&para;<br>neither of these cases did the Court adopt the proposition.&para;<br>In its defense of the corporate-speech restrictions in&para;<br>§441b, the Government notes the antidistortion rationale&para;<br>on which Austin and its progeny rest in part, yet it all but&para;<br>abandons reliance upon it. It argues instead that two&para;<br>other compelling interests support Austin’s holding that&para;<br>corporate expenditure restrictions are constitutional: an&para;<br>anticorruption interest, see 494 U. S., at 678 (STEVENS, J.,&para;<br>concurring), and a shareholder-protection interest, see id.,&para;<br>at 674–675 (Brennan, J., concurring). We consider the&para;<br>three points in turn.&para;<br>1&para;<br>As for Austin’s antidistortion rationale, the Government&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>33&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>does little to defend it. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45–48 (Sept.&para;<br>9, 2009). And with good reason, for the rationale cannot&para;<br>support §441b.&para;<br>If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Con&para;<br>gress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of&para;<br>citizens, for simply engaging in political speech. If the&para;<br>antidistortion rationale were to be accepted, however, it&para;<br>would permit Government to ban political speech simply&para;<br>because the speaker is an association that has taken on&para;<br>the corporate form. The Government contends that Austin&para;<br>permits it to ban corporate expenditures for almost all&para;<br>forms of communication stemming from a corporation.&para;<br>See Part II–E, supra; Tr. of Oral Arg. 66 (Sept. 9, 2009);&para;<br>see also id., at 26–31 (Mar. 24, 2009). If Austin were&para;<br>correct, the Government could prohibit a corporation from&para;<br>expressing political views in media beyond those pre&para;<br>sented here, such as by printing books. The Government&para;<br>responds “that the FEC has never applied this statute to a&para;<br>book,” and if it did, “there would be quite [a] good as&para;<br>applied challenge.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 65 (Sept. 9, 2009).&para;<br>This troubling assertion of brooding governmental power&para;<br>cannot be reconciled with the confidence and stability in&para;<br>civic discourse that the First Amendment must secure.&para;<br>Political speech is “indispensable to decisionmaking in a&para;<br>democracy, and this is no less true because the speech&para;<br>comes from a corporation rather than an individual.”&para;<br>Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 777 (footnote omitted); see ibid. (the&para;<br>worth of speech “does not depend upon the identity of its&para;<br>source, whether corporation, association, union, or indi&para;<br>vidual”); Buckley, 424 U. S., at 48–49 (“[T]he concept that&para;<br>government may restrict the speech of some elements of&para;<br>our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others&para;<br>is wholly foreign to the First Amendment”); Automobile&para;<br>Workers, 352 U. S., at 597 (Douglas, J., dissenting); CIO,&para;<br>335 U. S., at 154–155 (Rutledge, J., concurring in result).&para;<br>This protection for speech is inconsistent with Austin’s&para;<br>&para;<br>34&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>antidistortion rationale. Austin sought to defend the&para;<br>antidistortion rationale as a means to prevent corpora&para;<br>tions from obtaining “ ‘an unfair advantage in the political&para;<br>marketplace’ ” by using “ ‘resources amassed in the eco&para;<br>nomic marketplace.’ ” 494 U. S., at 659 (quoting MCFL,&para;<br>supra, at 257). But Buckley rejected the premise that the&para;<br>Government has an interest “in equalizing the relative&para;<br>ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome&para;<br>of elections.” 424 U. S., at 48; see Bellotti, supra, at 791,&para;<br>n. 30. Buckley was specific in stating that “the skyrocket&para;<br>ing cost of political campaigns” could not sustain the&para;<br>governmental prohibition. 424 U. S., at 26. The First&para;<br>Amendment’s protections do not depend on the speaker’s&para;<br>“financial ability to engage in public discussion.” Id., at&para;<br>49.&para;<br>The Court reaffirmed these conclusions when it invali&para;<br>dated the BCRA provision that increased the cap on con&para;<br>tributions to one candidate if the opponent made certain&para;<br>expenditures from personal funds. See Davis v. Federal&para;<br>Election Comm’n, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 16)&para;<br>(“Leveling electoral opportunities means making and&para;<br>implementing judgments about which strengths should be&para;<br>permitted to contribute to the outcome of an election. The&para;<br>Constitution, however, confers upon voters, not Congress,&para;<br>the power to choose the Members of the House of Repre&para;<br>sentatives, Art. I, §2, and it is a dangerous business for&para;<br>Congress to use the election laws to influence the voters’&para;<br>choices”). The rule that political speech cannot be limited&para;<br>based on a speaker’s wealth is a necessary consequence of&para;<br>the premise that the First Amendment generally prohibits&para;<br>the suppression of political speech based on the speaker’s&para;<br>identity.&para;<br>Either as support for its antidistortion rationale or as a&para;<br>further argument, the Austin majority undertook to dis&para;<br>tinguish wealthy individuals from corporations on the&para;<br>ground that “[s]tate law grants corporations special ad&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>35&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>vantages—such as limited liability, perpetual life, and&para;<br>favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution&para;<br>of assets.” 494 U. S., at 658–659. This does not suffice,&para;<br>however, to allow laws prohibiting speech. “It is rudimen&para;<br>tary that the State cannot exact as the price of those&para;<br>special advantages the forfeiture of First Amendment&para;<br>rights.” Id., at 680 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).&para;<br>It is irrelevant for purposes of the First Amendment&para;<br>that corporate funds may “have little or no correlation to&para;<br>the public’s support for the corporation’s political ideas.”&para;<br>Id., at 660 (majority opinion). All speakers, including&para;<br>individuals and the media, use money amassed from the&para;<br>economic marketplace to fund their speech. The First&para;<br>Amendment protects the resulting speech, even if it was&para;<br>enabled by economic transactions with persons or entities&para;<br>who disagree with the speaker’s ideas. See id., at 707&para;<br>(KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (“Many persons can trace their&para;<br>funds to corporations, if not in the form of donations, then&para;<br>in the form of dividends, interest, or salary”).&para;<br>Austin’s antidistortion rationale would produce the&para;<br>dangerous, and unacceptable, consequence that Congress&para;<br>could ban political speech of media corporations. See&para;<br>McConnell, 540 U. S., at 283 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (“The&para;<br>chilling endpoint of the Court’s reasoning is not difficult to&para;<br>foresee: outright regulation of the press”). Cf. Tornillo,&para;<br>418 U. S., at 250 (alleging the existence of “vast accumula&para;<br>tions of unreviewable power in the modern media em&para;<br>pires”). Media corporations are now exempt from §441b’s&para;<br>ban on corporate expenditures.&para;<br>See 2 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§431(9)(B)(i), 434(f)(3)(B)(i).&para;<br>Yet media corporations&para;<br>accumulate wealth with the help of the corporate form, the&para;<br>largest media corporations have “immense aggregations of&para;<br>wealth,” and the views expressed by media corporations&para;<br>often “have little or no correlation to the public’s support”&para;<br>for those views. Austin, 494 U. S., at 660. Thus, under&para;<br>the Government’s reasoning, wealthy media corporations&para;<br>&para;<br>36&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>could have their voices diminished to put them on par&para;<br>with other media entities. There is no precedent for per&para;<br>mitting this under the First Amendment.&para;<br>The media exemption discloses further difficulties with&para;<br>the law now under consideration. There is no precedent&para;<br>supporting laws that attempt to distinguish between&para;<br>corporations which are deemed to be exempt as media&para;<br>corporations and those which are not. “We have consis&para;<br>tently rejected the proposition that the institutional press&para;<br>has any constitutional privilege beyond that of other&para;<br>speakers.” Id., at 691 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (citing Bel&para;<br>lotti, 435 U. S., at 782); see Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. v.&para;<br>Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749, 784 (1985) (Bren&para;<br>nan, J., joined by Marshall, Blackmun, and STEVENS, JJ.,&para;<br>dissenting); id., at 773 (White, J., concurring in judgment).&para;<br>With the advent of the Internet and the decline of print&para;<br>and broadcast media, moreover, the line between the&para;<br>media and others who wish to comment on political and&para;<br>social issues becomes far more blurred.&para;<br>The law’s exception for media corporations is, on its own&para;<br>terms, all but an admission of the invalidity of the antidis&para;<br>tortion rationale. And the exemption results in a further,&para;<br>separate reason for finding this law invalid: Again by its&para;<br>own terms, the law exempts some corporations but covers&para;<br>others, even though both have the need or the motive to&para;<br>communicate their views. The exemption applies to media&para;<br>corporations owned or controlled by corporations that have&para;<br>diverse and substantial investments and participate in&para;<br>endeavors other than news. So even assuming the most&para;<br>doubtful proposition that a news organization has a right&para;<br>to speak when others do not, the exemption would allow a&para;<br>conglomerate that owns both a media business and an&para;<br>unrelated business to influence or control the media in&para;<br>order to advance its overall business interest. At the same&para;<br>time, some other corporation, with an identical business&para;<br>interest but no media outlet in its ownership structure,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>37&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>would be forbidden to speak or inform the public about the&para;<br>same issue. This differential treatment cannot be squared&para;<br>with the First Amendment.&para;<br>There is simply no support for the view that the First&para;<br>Amendment, as originally understood, would permit the&para;<br>suppression of political speech by media corporations. The&para;<br>Framers may not have anticipated modern business and&para;<br>media corporations.&para;<br>See McIntyre v. Ohio Elections&para;<br>Comm’n, 514 U. S. 334, 360–361 (1995) (THOMAS, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment). Yet television networks and&para;<br>major newspapers owned by media corporations have&para;<br>become the most important means of mass communication&para;<br>in modern times. The First Amendment was certainly not&para;<br>understood to condone the suppression of political speech&para;<br>in society’s most salient media. It was understood as a&para;<br>response to the repression of speech and the press that&para;<br>had existed in England and the heavy taxes on the press&para;<br>that were imposed in the colonies. See McConnell, 540&para;<br>U. S., at 252–253 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); Grosjean, 297&para;<br>U. S., at 245–248; Near, 283 U. S., at 713–714. The great&para;<br>debates between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists&para;<br>over our founding document were published and expressed&para;<br>in the most important means of mass communication of&para;<br>that era—newspapers owned by individuals. See McIn&para;<br>tyre, 514 U. S., at 341–343; id., at 367 (THOMAS, J., con&para;<br>curring in judgment). At the founding, speech was open,&para;<br>comprehensive, and vital to society’s definition of itself;&para;<br>there were no limits on the sources of speech and knowl&para;<br>edge. See B. Bailyn, Ideological Origins of the American&para;<br>Revolution 5 (1967) (“Any number of people could join in&para;<br>such proliferating polemics, and rebuttals could come from&para;<br>all sides”); G. Wood, Creation of the American Republic&para;<br>1776–1787, p. 6 (1969) (“[I]t is not surprising that the&para;<br>intellectual sources of [the Americans’] Revolutionary&para;<br>thought were profuse and various”). The Framers may&para;<br>have been unaware of certain types of speakers or forms of&para;<br>&para;<br>38&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>communication, but that does not mean that those speak&para;<br>ers and media are entitled to less First Amendment pro&para;<br>tection than those types of speakers and media that pro&para;<br>vided the means of communicating political ideas when&para;<br>the Bill of Rights was adopted.&para;<br>Austin interferes with the “open marketplace” of ideas&para;<br>protected by the First Amendment. New York State Bd. of&para;<br>Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U. S. 196, 208 (2008); see&para;<br>ibid. (ideas “may compete” in this marketplace “without&para;<br>government interference”); McConnell, supra, at 274&para;<br>(opinion of THOMAS, J.). It permits the Government to ban&para;<br>the political speech of millions of associations of citizens.&para;<br>See Statistics of Income 2 (5.8 million for-profit corpora&para;<br>tions filed 2006 tax returns). Most of these are small&para;<br>corporations without large amounts of wealth. See Supp.&para;<br>Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of&para;<br>America as Amicus Curiae 1, 3 (96% of the 3 million busi&para;<br>nesses that belong to the U. S.

S. C.&para;<br>§301, have less than $1 million in receipts per year). This&para;<br>fact belies the Government’s argument that the statute is&para;<br>justified on the ground that it prevents the “distorting&para;<br>effects of immense aggregations of wealth.” Austin, 494&para;<br>U. S., at 660. It is not even aimed at amassed wealth.&para;<br>The censorship we now confront is vast in its reach. The&para;<br>Government has “muffle[d] the voices that best represent&para;<br>the most significant segments of the economy.” McCon&para;<br>nell, supra, at 257–258 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). And “the&para;<br>electorate [has been] deprived of information, knowledge&para;<br>and opinion vital to its function.” CIO, 335 U. S., at 144&para;<br>(Rutledge, J., concurring in result). By suppressing the&para;<br>speech of manifold corporations, both for-profit and non&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>39&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>profit, the Government prevents their voices and view&para;<br>points from reaching the public and advising voters on&para;<br>which persons or entities are hostile to their interests.&para;<br>Factions will necessarily form in our Republic, but the&para;<br>remedy of “destroying the liberty” of some factions is&para;<br>“worse than the disease.” The Federalist No. 10, p. 130 (B.&para;<br>Wright ed. 1961) (J. Madison). Factions should be checked&para;<br>by permitting them all to speak, see ibid., and by entrust&para;<br>ing the people to judge what is true and what is false.&para;<br>The purpose and effect of this law is to prevent corpora&para;<br>tions, including small and nonprofit corporations, from&para;<br>presenting both facts and opinions to the public. This&para;<br>makes Austin’s antidistortion rationale all the more an&para;<br>aberration. “[T]he First Amendment protects the right of&para;<br>corporations to petition legislative and administrative&para;<br>bodies.” Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 792, n. 31 (citing California&para;<br>Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U. S. 508,&para;<br>510–511 (1972); Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v.&para;<br>Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U. S. 127, 137–138 (1961)).&para;<br>Corporate executives and employees counsel Members of&para;<br>Congress and Presidential administrations on many is&para;<br>sues, as a matter of routine and often in private. An amici&para;<br>brief filed on behalf of Montana and 25 other States notes&para;<br>that lobbying and corporate communications with elected&para;<br>officials occur on a regular basis. Brief for State of Mon&para;<br>tana et al. as Amici Curiae 19. When that phenomenon is&para;<br>coupled with §441b, the result is that smaller or nonprofit&para;<br>corporations cannot raise a voice to object when other&para;<br>corporations, including those with vast wealth, are coop&para;<br>erating with the Government. That cooperation may&para;<br>sometimes be voluntary, or it may be at the demand of a&para;<br>Government official who uses his or her authority, influ&para;<br>ence, and power to threaten corporations to support the&para;<br>Government’s policies. Those kinds of interactions are&para;<br>often unknown and unseen. The speech that §441b for&para;<br>bids, though, is public, and all can judge its content and&para;<br>&para;<br>40&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>purpose.&para;<br>References to massive corporate treasuries&para;<br>should not mask the real operation of this law. Rhetoric&para;<br>ought not obscure reality.&para;<br>Even if §441b’s expenditure ban were constitutional,&para;<br>wealthy corporations could still lobby elected officials,&para;<br>although smaller corporations may not have the resources&para;<br>to do so. And wealthy individuals and unincorporated&para;<br>associations can spend unlimited amounts on independent&para;<br>expenditures. See, e.g., WRTL, 551 U. S., at 503–504&para;<br>(opinion of SCALIA, J.) (“In the 2004 election cycle, a mere&para;<br>24 individuals contributed an astounding total of $142&para;<br>million to [26 U. S. C. §527 organizations]”). Yet certain&para;<br>disfavored associations of citizens—those that have taken&para;<br>on the corporate form—are penalized for engaging in the&para;<br>same political speech.&para;<br>When Government seeks to use its full power, including&para;<br>the criminal law, to command where a person may get his&para;<br>or her information or what distrusted source he or she&para;<br>may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought. This&para;<br>is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom&para;<br>to think for ourselves.&para;<br>2&para;<br>What we have said also shows the invalidity of other&para;<br>arguments made by the Government. For the most part&para;<br>relinquishing the antidistortion rationale, the Government&para;<br>falls back on the argument that corporate political speech&para;<br>can be banned in order to prevent corruption or its ap&para;<br>pearance. In Buckley, the Court found this interest “suffi&para;<br>ciently important” to allow limits on contributions but did&para;<br>not extend that reasoning to expenditure limits. 424 U. S.,&para;<br>at 25. When Buckley examined an expenditure ban, it&para;<br>found “that the governmental interest in preventing cor&para;<br>ruption and the appearance of corruption [was] inade&para;<br>quate to justify [the ban] on independent expenditures.”&para;<br>Id., at 45.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

S. C. §201, if a quid pro quo arrange&para;<br>ment were proved. See Buckley, supra, at 27, and n. 28&para;<br>(citing Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F. 2d 821, 839–840, and nn.&para;<br>36–38 (CADC 1975) (en banc) (per curiam)). The Court, in&para;<br>consequence, has noted that restrictions on direct contri&para;<br>butions are preventative, because few if any contributions&para;<br>to candidates will involve quid pro quo arrangements.&para;<br>MCFL, 479 U. S., at 260; NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 500; Fed&para;<br>eral Election Comm’n v. National Right to Work Comm.,&para;<br>459 U. S. 197, 210 (1982) (NRWC). The Buckley Court,&para;<br>nevertheless, sustained limits on direct contributions in&para;<br>order to ensure against the reality or appearance of cor&para;<br>ruption. That case did not extend this rationale to inde&para;<br>pendent expenditures, and the Court does not do so here.&para;<br>“The absence of prearrangement and coordination of an&para;<br>expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only&para;<br>undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate,&para;<br>but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be&para;<br>given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from&para;<br>the candidate.” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 47; see ibid. (inde&para;<br>pendent expenditures have a “substantially diminished&para;<br>potential for abuse”). Limits on independent expendi&para;<br>tures, such as §441b, have a chilling effect extending well&para;<br>beyond the Government’s interest in preventing quid pro&para;<br>quo corruption. The anticorruption interest is not suffi&para;<br>cient to displace the speech here in question. Indeed, 26&para;<br>States do not restrict independent expenditures by for&para;<br>profit corporations. The Government does not claim that&para;<br>these expenditures have corrupted the political process in&para;<br>those States. See Supp. Brief for Appellee 18, n. 3; Supp.&para;<br>Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United States of&para;<br>&para;<br>42&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>America as Amicus Curiae 8–9, n. 5.&para;<br>A single footnote in Bellotti purported to leave open the&para;<br>possibility that corporate independent expenditures could&para;<br>be shown to cause corruption. 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26. For&para;<br>the reasons explained above, we now conclude that inde&para;<br>pendent expenditures, including those made by corpora&para;<br>tions, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of&para;<br>corruption. Dicta in Bellotti’s footnote suggested that “a&para;<br>corporation’s right to speak on issues of general public&para;<br>interest implies no comparable right in the quite different&para;<br>context of participation in a political campaign for election&para;<br>to public office.” Ibid. Citing the portion of Buckley that&para;<br>invalidated the federal independent expenditure ban, 424&para;<br>U. S., at 46, and a law review student comment, Bellotti&para;<br>surmised that “Congress might well be able to demon&para;<br>strate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corrup&para;<br>tion in independent expenditures by corporations to influ&para;<br>ence candidate elections.” 435 U. S., at 788, n. 26.&para;<br>Buckley, however, struck down a ban on independent&para;<br>expenditures to support candidates that covered corpora&para;<br>tions, 424 U. S., at 23, 39, n. 45, and explained that “the&para;<br>distinction between discussion of issues and candidates&para;<br>and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often&para;<br>dissolve in practical application,” id., at 42. Bellotti’s&para;<br>dictum is thus supported only by a law review student&para;<br>comment, which misinterpreted Buckley. See Comment,&para;<br>The Regulation of Union Political Activity: Majority and&para;<br>Minority Rights and Remedies, 126 U. Pa. L. Rev. 386, 408&para;<br>(1977) (suggesting that “corporations and labor unions&para;<br>should be held to different and more stringent standards&para;<br>than an individual or other associations under a regula&para;<br>tory scheme for campaign financing”).&para;<br>Seizing on this aside in Bellotti’s footnote, the Court in&para;<br>NRWC did say there is a “sufficient” governmental inter&para;<br>est in “ensur[ing] that substantial aggregations of wealth&para;<br>amassed” by corporations would not “be used to incur&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

NRWC,&para;<br>however, has little relevance here. NRWC decided no&para;<br>more than that a restriction on a corporation’s ability to&para;<br>solicit funds for its segregated PAC, which made direct&para;<br>contributions to candidates, did not violate the First&para;<br>Amendment. 459 U. S., at 206. NRWC thus involved&para;<br>contribution limits, see NCPAC, supra, at 495–496, which,&para;<br>unlike limits on independent expenditures, have been an&para;<br>accepted means to prevent quid pro quo corruption, see&para;<br>McConnell, 540 U. S., at 136–138, and n. 40; MCFL, su&para;<br>pra, at 259–260. Citizens United has not made direct&para;<br>contributions to candidates, and it has not suggested that&para;<br>the Court should reconsider whether contribution limits&para;<br>should be subjected to rigorous First Amendment scrutiny.&para;<br>When Buckley identified a sufficiently important gov&para;<br>ernmental interest in preventing corruption or the ap&para;<br>pearance of corruption, that interest was limited to quid&para;<br>pro quo corruption. See McConnell, supra, at 296–298&para;<br>(opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (citing Buckley, supra, at 26–28,&para;<br>30, 46–48); NCPAC, 470 U.

The fact that speakers may have&para;<br>influence over or access to elected officials does not mean&para;<br>that these officials are corrupt:&para;<br>“Favoritism and influence are not . . . avoidable in&para;<br>representative politics. It is in the nature of an&para;<br>elected representative to favor certain policies, and, by&para;<br>necessary corollary, to favor the voters and contribu&para;<br>tors who support those policies.

By&para;<br>definition, an independent expenditure is political speech&para;<br>presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a&para;<br>candidate. See Buckley, supra, at 46. The fact that a&para;<br>corporation, or any other speaker, is willing to spend&para;<br>money to try to persuade voters presupposes that the&para;<br>people have the ultimate influence over elected officials.&para;<br>This is inconsistent with any suggestion that the elector&para;<br>ate will refuse “ ‘to take part in democratic governance’ ”&para;<br>because of additional political speech made by a corpora&para;<br>tion or any other speaker. McConnell, supra, at 144 (quot&para;<br>ing Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S.&para;<br>377, 390 (2000)).&para;<br>Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.

Caperton held that a judge was&para;<br>required to recuse himself “when a person with a personal&para;<br>stake in a particular case had a significant and dispropor&para;<br>tionate influence in placing the judge on the case by rais&para;<br>ing funds or directing the judge’s election campaign when&para;<br>the case was pending or imminent.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>14). The remedy of recusal was based on a litigant’s due&para;<br>process right to a fair trial before an unbiased judge. See&para;<br>Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U. S. 35, 46 (1975).

This&para;<br>confirms Buckley’s reasoning that independent expendi&para;<br>tures do not lead to, or create the appearance of, quid pro&para;<br>quo corruption. In fact, there is only scant evidence that&para;<br>independent expenditures even ingratiate.&para;<br>See 251&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 555–557 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.).&para;<br>Ingratiation and access, in any event, are not corruption.&para;<br>The BCRA record establishes that certain donations to&para;<br>political parties, called “soft money,” were made to gain&para;<br>access to elected officials. McConnell, supra, at 125, 130–&para;<br>131, 146–152; see McConnell I, 251 F.

This case, however, is&para;<br>about independent expenditures, not soft money. When&para;<br>Congress finds that a problem exists, we must give that&para;<br>finding due deference; but Congress may not choose an&para;<br>unconstitutional remedy. If elected officials succumb to&para;<br>improper influences from independent expenditures; if&para;<br>they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expe&para;<br>diency before principle, then surely there is cause for&para;<br>concern. We must give weight to attempts by Congress to&para;<br>seek to dispel either the appearance or the reality of these&para;<br>influences. The remedies enacted by law, however, must&para;<br>comply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and&para;<br>our tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing&para;<br>rule. An outright ban on corporate political speech during&para;<br>the critical preelection period is not a permissible remedy.&para;<br>Here Congress has created categorical bans on speech that&para;<br>are asymmetrical to preventing quid pro quo corruption.&para;<br>&para;<br>46&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>The Government contends further that corporate inde&para;<br>pendent expenditures can be limited because of its interest&para;<br>in protecting dissenting shareholders from being com&para;<br>pelled to fund corporate political speech. This asserted&para;<br>interest, like Austin’s antidistortion rationale, would allow&para;<br>the Government to ban the political speech even of media&para;<br>corporations. See supra, at 35–37. Assume, for example,&para;<br>that a shareholder of a corporation that owns a newspaper&para;<br>disagrees with the political views the newspaper ex&para;<br>presses. See Austin, 494 U. S., at 687 (SCALIA, J., dissent&para;<br>ing). Under the Government’s view, that potential dis&para;<br>agreement could give the Government the authority to&para;<br>restrict the media corporation’s political speech. The First&para;<br>Amendment does not allow that power. There is, further&para;<br>more, little evidence of abuse that cannot be corrected by&para;<br>shareholders “through the procedures of corporate democ&para;<br>racy.” Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 794; see id., at 794, n. 34.&para;<br>Those reasons are sufficient to reject this shareholder&para;<br>protection interest; and, moreover, the statute is both&para;<br>underinclusive and overinclusive. As to the first, if Con&para;<br>gress had been seeking to protect dissenting shareholders,&para;<br>it would not have banned corporate speech in only certain&para;<br>media within 30 or 60 days before an election. A dissent&para;<br>ing shareholder’s interests would be implicated by speech&para;<br>in any media at any time. As to the second, the statute is&para;<br>overinclusive because it covers all corporations, including&para;<br>nonprofit corporations and for-profit corporations with&para;<br>only single shareholders. As to other corporations, the&para;<br>remedy is not to restrict speech but to consider and ex&para;<br>plore other regulatory mechanisms.&para;<br>The regulatory&para;<br>mechanism here, based on speech, contravenes the First&para;<br>Amendment.&para;<br>4&para;<br>We need not reach the question whether the Govern&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

Section&para;<br>441b is not limited to corporations or associations that&para;<br>were created in foreign countries or funded predominately&para;<br>by foreign shareholders. Section 441b therefore would be&para;<br>overbroad even if we assumed, arguendo, that the Gov&para;<br>ernment has a compelling interest in limiting foreign&para;<br>influence over our political process. See Broadrick, 413&para;<br>U. S., at 615.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Our precedent is to be respected unless the most con&para;<br>vincing of reasons demonstrates that adherence to it puts&para;<br>us on a course that is sure error. “Beyond workability, the&para;<br>relevant factors in deciding whether to adhere to the&para;<br>principle of stare decisis include the antiquity of the&para;<br>precedent, the reliance interests at stake, and of course&para;<br>whether the decision was well reasoned.” Montejo v.&para;<br>Louisiana, 556 U.

FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>relying almost entirely on “the quid pro quo interest, the&para;<br>corruption interest or the shareholder interest,” and not&para;<br>Austin’s expressed antidistortion rationale. Tr. of Oral&para;<br>Arg. 48 (Sept. 9, 2009); see id., at 45–46. When neither&para;<br>party defends the reasoning of a precedent, the principle of&para;<br>adhering to that precedent through stare decisis is dimin&para;<br>ished. Austin abandoned First Amendment principles,&para;<br>furthermore, by relying on language in some of our prece&para;<br>dents that traces back to the Automobile Workers Court’s&para;<br>flawed historical account of campaign finance laws, see&para;<br>Brief for Campaign Finance Scholars as Amici Curiae;&para;<br>Hayward, 45 Harv. J. Legis. 421; R. Mutch, Campaigns,&para;<br>Congress, and Courts 33–35, 153–157 (1988). See Austin,&para;<br>supra, at 659 (quoting MCFL, 479 U. S., at 257–258;&para;<br>NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 500–501); MCFL, supra, at 257&para;<br>(quoting Automobile Workers, 352 U. S., at 585); NCPAC,&para;<br>supra, at 500 (quoting NRWC, 459 U. S., at 210); id., at&para;<br>208 (“The history of the movement to regulate the political&para;<br>contributions and expenditures of corporations and labor&para;<br>unions is set forth in great detail in [Automobile Workers],&para;<br>supra, at 570–584, and we need only summarize the de&para;<br>velopment here”).&para;<br>Austin is undermined by experience since its an&para;<br>nouncement. Political speech is so ingrained in our cul&para;<br>ture that speakers find ways to circumvent campaign&para;<br>finance laws. See, e.g., McConnell, 540 U. S., at 176–177&para;<br>(“Given BCRA’s tighter restrictions on the raising and&para;<br>spending of soft money, the incentives . . . to exploit [26&para;<br>U. S. C. §527] organizations will only increase”). Our&para;<br>Nation’s speech dynamic is changing, and informative&para;<br>voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions&para;<br>to exercise their First Amendment rights. Speakers have&para;<br>become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites,&para;<br>talking points, and scripted messages that dominate the&para;<br>24-hour news cycle. Corporations, like individuals, do not&para;<br>have monolithic views. On certain topics corporations&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>49&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>may possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best&para;<br>equipped to point out errors or fallacies in speech of&para;<br>all sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected&para;<br>officials.&para;<br>Rapid changes in technology—and the creative dynamic&para;<br>inherent in the concept of free expression—counsel against&para;<br>upholding a law that restricts political speech in certain&para;<br>media or by certain speakers. See Part II–C, supra.&para;<br>Today, 30-second television ads may be the most effective&para;<br>way to convey a political message. See McConnell, supra,&para;<br>at 261 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Soon, however, it may be&para;<br>that Internet sources, such as blogs and social networking&para;<br>Web sites, will provide citizens with significant informa&para;<br>tion about political candidates and issues. Yet, §441b&para;<br>would seem to ban a blog post expressly advocating the&para;<br>election or defeat of a candidate if that blog were created&para;<br>with corporate funds. See 2 U. S. C. §441b(a); MCFL,&para;<br>supra, at 249. The First Amendment does not permit&para;<br>Congress to make these categorical distinctions based on&para;<br>the corporate identity of the speaker and the content of&para;<br>the political speech.&para;<br>No serious reliance interests are at stake. As the Court&para;<br>stated in Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991),&para;<br>reliance interests are important considerations in property&para;<br>and contract cases, where parties may have acted in con&para;<br>formance with existing legal rules in order to conduct&para;<br>transactions. Here, though, parties have been prevented&para;<br>from acting—corporations have been banned from making&para;<br>independent expenditures. Legislatures may have en&para;<br>acted bans on corporate expenditures believing that those&para;<br>bans were constitutional. This is not a compelling interest&para;<br>for stare decisis. If it were, legislative acts could prevent&para;<br>us from overruling our own precedents, thereby interfer&para;<br>ing with our duty “to say what the law is.” Marbury v.&para;<br>Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803).&para;<br>Due consideration leads to this conclusion: Austin, 494&para;<br>&para;<br>50&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>U. S. 652, should be and now is overruled. We return to&para;<br>the principle established in Buckley and Bellotti that the&para;<br>Government may not suppress political speech on the&para;<br>basis of the speaker’s corporate identity. No sufficient&para;<br>governmental interest justifies limits on the political&para;<br>speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.&para;<br>D&para;<br>Austin is overruled, so it provides no basis for allowing&para;<br>the Government to limit corporate independent expendi&para;<br>tures. As the Government appears to concede, overruling&para;<br>Austin “effectively invalidate[s] not only BCRA Section&para;<br>203, but also 2 U. S. C. 441b’s prohibition on the use of&para;<br>corporate treasury funds for express advocacy.” Brief for&para;<br>Appellee 33, n. 12. Section 441b’s restrictions on corporate&para;<br>independent expenditures are therefore invalid and can&para;<br>not be applied to Hillary.&para;<br>Given our conclusion we are further required to overrule&para;<br>the part of McConnell that upheld BCRA §203’s extension&para;<br>of §441b’s restrictions on corporate independent expendi&para;<br>tures. See 540 U. S., at 203–209. The McConnell Court&para;<br>relied on the antidistortion interest recognized in Austin&para;<br>to uphold a greater restriction on speech than the restric&para;<br>tion upheld in Austin, see 540 U. S., at 205, and we have&para;<br>found this interest unconvincing and insufficient. This&para;<br>part of McConnell is now overruled.&para;<br>IV &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Citizens United next challenges BCRA’s disclaimer and&para;<br>disclosure provisions as applied to Hillary and the three&para;<br>advertisements for the movie. Under BCRA §311, tele&para;<br>vised electioneering communications funded by anyone&para;<br>other than a candidate must include a disclaimer that&para;<br>“ ‘_______ is responsible for the content of this advertis&para;<br>ing.’ ” 2 U. S. C. §441d(d)(2). The required statement&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>51&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>must be made in a “clearly spoken manner,” and displayed&para;<br>on the screen in a “clearly readable manner” for at least&para;<br>four seconds. Ibid. It must state that the communication&para;<br>“is not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s commit&para;<br>tee”; it must also display the name and address (or Web&para;<br>site address) of the person or group that funded the adver&para;<br>tisement. §441d(a)(3). Under BCRA §201, any person&para;<br>who spends more than $10,000 on electioneering commu&para;<br>nications within a calendar year must file a disclosure&para;<br>statement with the FEC. 2 U. S. C. §434(f)(1). That&para;<br>statement must identify the person making the expendi&para;<br>ture, the amount of the expenditure, the election to which&para;<br>the communication was directed, and the names of certain&para;<br>contributors. §434(f)(2).&para;<br>Disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the&para;<br>ability to speak, but they “impose no ceiling on campaign&para;<br>related activities,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 64, and “do not&para;<br>prevent anyone from speaking,” McConnell, supra, at 201&para;<br>(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The&para;<br>Court has subjected these requirements to “exacting scru&para;<br>tiny,” which requires a “substantial relation” between the&para;<br>disclosure requirement and a “sufficiently important”&para;<br>governmental interest. Buckley, supra, at 64, 66 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted); see McConnell, supra, at 231–&para;<br>232.&para;<br>In Buckley, the Court explained that disclosure could be&para;<br>justified based on a governmental interest in “provid[ing]&para;<br>the electorate with information” about the sources of&para;<br>election-related spending. 424 U. S., at 66. The McCon&para;<br>nell Court applied this interest in rejecting facial chal&para;<br>lenges to BCRA §§201 and 311. 540 U. S., at 196. There&para;<br>was evidence in the record that independent groups were&para;<br>running election-related advertisements “ ‘while hiding&para;<br>behind dubious and misleading names.’ ” Id., at 197 (quot&para;<br>ing McConnell I, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 237). The Court&para;<br>therefore upheld BCRA §§201 and 311 on the ground that&para;<br>&para;<br>52&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>they would help citizens “ ‘make informed choices in the&para;<br>political marketplace.’ ” 540 U. S., at 197 (quoting McCon&para;<br>nell I, supra, at 237); see 540 U. S., at 231.&para;<br>Although both provisions were facially upheld, the&para;<br>Court acknowledged that as-applied challenges would be&para;<br>available if a group could show a “ ‘reasonable probability’ ”&para;<br>that disclosure of its contributors’ names “ ‘will subject&para;<br>them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either&para;<br>Government officials or private parties.’ ” Id., at 198&para;<br>(quoting Buckley, supra, at 74).&para;<br>For the reasons stated below, we find the statute valid&para;<br>as applied to the ads for the movie and to the movie itself.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Citizens United sought to broadcast one 30-second and&para;<br>two 10-second ads to promote Hillary. Under FEC regula&para;<br>tions, a communication that “[p]roposes a commercial&para;<br>transaction” was not subject to 2 U. S. C. §441b’s restric&para;<br>tions on corporate or union funding of electioneering com&para;<br>munications. 11 CFR §114.15(b)(3)(ii). The regulations,&para;<br>however, do not exempt those communications from the&para;<br>disclaimer and disclosure requirements in BCRA §§201&para;<br>and 311. See 72 Fed. Reg. 72901 (2007).&para;<br>Citizens United argues that the disclaimer require&para;<br>ments in §311 are unconstitutional as applied to its ads.&para;<br>It contends that the governmental interest in providing&para;<br>information to the electorate does not justify requiring&para;<br>disclaimers for any commercial advertisements, including&para;<br>the ones at issue here. We disagree. The ads fall within&para;<br>BCRA’s definition of an “electioneering communication”:&para;<br>They referred to then-Senator Clinton by name shortly&para;<br>before a primary and contained pejorative references to&para;<br>her candidacy. See 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 276, nn. 2–4. The&para;<br>disclaimers required by §311 “provid[e] the electorate with&para;<br>information,” McConnell, supra, at 196, and “insure that&para;<br>the voters are fully informed” about the person or group&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>53&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>who is speaking, Buckley, supra, at 76; see also Bellotti,&para;<br>435 U. S., at 792, n. 32 (“Identification of the source of&para;<br>advertising may be required as a means of disclosure, so&para;<br>that the people will be able to evaluate the arguments to&para;<br>which they are being subjected”). At the very least, the&para;<br>disclaimers avoid confusion by making clear that the ads&para;<br>are not funded by a candidate or political party.&para;<br>Citizens United argues that §311 is underinclusive&para;<br>because it requires disclaimers for broadcast advertise&para;<br>ments but not for print or Internet advertising. It asserts&para;<br>that §311 decreases both the quantity and effectiveness of&para;<br>the group’s speech by forcing it to devote four seconds of&para;<br>each advertisement to the spoken disclaimer. We rejected&para;<br>these arguments in McConnell, supra, at 230–231. And&para;<br>we now adhere to that decision as it pertains to the disclo&para;<br>sure provisions.&para;<br>As a final point, Citizens United claims that, in any&para;<br>event, the disclosure requirements in §201 must be con&para;<br>fined to speech that is the functional equivalent of express&para;<br>advocacy. The principal opinion in WRTL limited 2&para;<br>U. S. C. §441b’s restrictions on independent expenditures&para;<br>to express advocacy and its functional equivalent. 551&para;<br>U. S., at 469–476 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). Citizens&para;<br>United seeks to import a similar distinction into BCRA’s&para;<br>disclosure requirements. We reject this contention.&para;<br>The Court has explained that disclosure is a less restric&para;<br>tive alternative to more comprehensive regulations of&para;<br>speech. See, e.g., MCFL, 479 U. S., at 262. In Buckley, the&para;<br>Court upheld a disclosure requirement for independent&para;<br>expenditures even though it invalidated a provision that&para;<br>imposed a ceiling on those expenditures. 424 U. S., at 75–&para;<br>76. In McConnell, three Justices who would have found&para;<br>§441b to be unconstitutional nonetheless voted to uphold&para;<br>BCRA’s disclosure and disclaimer requirements. 540&para;<br>U. S., at 321 (opinion of KENNEDY, J., joined by Rehnquist,&para;<br>C. J., and SCALIA, J.). And the Court has upheld registra&para;<br>&para;<br>54&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tion and disclosure requirements on lobbyists, even&para;<br>though Congress has no power to ban lobbying itself.&para;<br>United States v. Harriss, 347 U. S. 612, 625 (1954) (Con&para;<br>gress “has merely provided for a modicum of information&para;<br>from those who for hire attempt to influence legislation or&para;<br>who collect or spend funds for that purpose”). For these&para;<br>reasons, we reject Citizens United’s contention that the&para;<br>disclosure requirements must be limited to speech that is&para;<br>the functional equivalent of express advocacy.&para;<br>Citizens United also disputes that an informational&para;<br>interest justifies the application of §201 to its ads, which&para;<br>only attempt to persuade viewers to see the film. Even if&para;<br>it disclosed the funding sources for the ads, Citizens&para;<br>United says, the information would not help viewers make&para;<br>informed choices in the political marketplace. This is&para;<br>similar to the argument rejected above with respect to&para;<br>disclaimers. Even if the ads only pertain to a commercial&para;<br>transaction, the public has an interest in knowing who is&para;<br>speaking about a candidate shortly before an election.&para;<br>Because the informational interest alone is sufficient to&para;<br>justify application of §201 to these ads, it is not necessary&para;<br>to consider the Government’s other asserted interests.&para;<br>Last, Citizens United argues that disclosure require&para;<br>ments can chill donations to an organization by exposing&para;<br>donors to retaliation. Some amici point to recent events in&para;<br>which donors to certain causes were blacklisted, threat&para;<br>ened, or otherwise targeted for retaliation. See Brief for&para;<br>Institute for Justice as Amicus Curiae 13–16; Brief for&para;<br>Alliance Defense Fund as Amicus Curiae 16–22. In&para;<br>McConnell, the Court recognized that §201 would be un&para;<br>constitutional as applied to an organization if there were a&para;<br>reasonable probability that the group’s members would&para;<br>face threats, harassment, or reprisals if their names were&para;<br>disclosed. 540 U. S., at 198. The examples cited by amici&para;<br>are cause for concern. Citizens United, however, has&para;<br>offered no evidence that its members may face similar&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>55&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>threats or reprisals. To the contrary, Citizens United has&para;<br>been disclosing its donors for years and has identified no&para;<br>instance of harassment or retaliation.&para;<br>Shareholder objections raised through the procedures of&para;<br>corporate democracy, see Bellotti, supra, at 794, and n. 34,&para;<br>can be more effective today because modern technology&para;<br>makes disclosures rapid and informative. A campaign&para;<br>finance system that pairs corporate independent expendi&para;<br>tures with effective disclosure has not existed before to&para;<br>day. It must be noted, furthermore, that many of Con&para;<br>gress’ findings in passing BCRA were premised on a&para;<br>system without adequate disclosure. See McConnell, 540&para;<br>U. S., at 128 (“[T]he public may not have been fully in&para;<br>formed about the sponsorship of so-called issue ads”); id.,&para;<br>at 196–197 (quoting McConnell I, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 237).&para;<br>With the advent of the Internet, prompt disclosure of&para;<br>expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with&para;<br>the information needed to hold corporations and elected&para;<br>officials accountable for their positions and supporters.&para;<br>Shareholders can determine whether their corporation’s&para;<br>political speech advances the corporation’s interest in&para;<br>making profits, and citizens can see whether elected offi&para;<br>cials are “ ‘in the pocket’ of so-called moneyed interests.”&para;<br>540 U. S., at 259 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); see MCFL, supra,&para;<br>at 261. The First Amendment protects political speech;&para;<br>and disclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react&para;<br>to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This&para;<br>transparency enables the electorate to make informed&para;<br>decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and&para;<br>messages.&para;<br>C&para;<br>For the same reasons we uphold the application of&para;<br>BCRA §§201 and 311 to the ads, we affirm their applica&para;<br>tion to Hillary. We find no constitutional impediment to&para;<br>the application of BCRA’s disclaimer and disclosure re&para;<br>&para;<br>56&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>quirements to a movie broadcast via video-on-demand.&para;<br>And there has been no showing that, as applied in this&para;<br>case, these requirements would impose a chill on speech or&para;<br>expression.&para;<br>V&para;<br>When word concerning the plot of the movie Mr. Smith&para;<br>Goes to Washington reached the circles of Government,&para;<br>some officials sought, by persuasion, to discourage its&para;<br>distribution. See Smoodin, “Compulsory” Viewing for&para;<br>Every Citizen: Mr. Smith and the Rhetoric of Reception,&para;<br>35 Cinema Journal 3, 19, and n. 52 (Winter 1996) (citing&para;<br>Mr. Smith Riles Washington, Time, Oct. 30, 1939, p. 49);&para;<br>Nugent, Capra’s Capitol Offense, N. Y. Times, Oct. 29,&para;<br>1939, p. X5. Under Austin, though, officials could have&para;<br>done more than discourage its distribution—they could&para;<br>have banned the film. After all, it, like Hillary, was&para;<br>speech funded by a corporation that was critical of Mem&para;<br>bers of Congress. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington may be&para;<br>fiction and caricature; but fiction and caricature can be a&para;<br>powerful force.&para;<br>Modern day movies, television comedies, or skits on&para;<br>Youtube.com might portray public officials or public poli&para;<br>cies in unflattering ways. Yet if a covered transmission&para;<br>during the blackout period creates the background for&para;<br>candidate endorsement or opposition, a felony occurs&para;<br>solely because a corporation, other than an exempt media&para;<br>corporation, has made the “purchase, payment, distribu&para;<br>tion, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of&para;<br>value” in order to engage in political speech. 2 U. S. C.&para;<br>§431(9)(A)(i). Speech would be suppressed in the realm&para;<br>where its necessity is most evident: in the public dialogue&para;<br>preceding a real election. Governments are often hostile&para;<br>to speech, but under our law and our tradition it seems&para;<br>stranger than fiction for our Government to make this&para;<br>political speech a crime. Yet this is the statute’s purpose&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>57&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and design.&para;<br>Some members of the public might consider Hillary to&para;<br>be insightful and instructive; some might find it to be&para;<br>neither high art nor a fair discussion on how to set the&para;<br>Nation’s course; still others simply might suspend judg&para;<br>ment on these points but decide to think more about issues&para;<br>and candidates. Those choices and assessments, however,&para;<br>are not for the Government to make. “The First Amend&para;<br>ment underwrites the freedom to experiment and to create&para;<br>in the realm of thought and speech. Citizens must be free&para;<br>to use new forms, and new forums, for the expression of&para;<br>ideas. The civic discourse belongs to the people, and the&para;<br>Government may not prescribe the means used to conduct&para;<br>it.” McConnell, supra, at 341 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).&para;<br>The judgment of the District Court is reversed with&para;<br>respect to the constitutionality of 2 U. S. C. §441b’s re&para;<br>strictions on corporate independent expenditures. The&para;<br>judgment is affirmed with respect to BCRA’s disclaimer&para;<br>and disclosure requirements. The case is remanded for&para;<br>further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

First Amendment rights could be confined&para;<br>to individuals, subverting the vibrant public discourse&para;<br>that is at the foundation of our democracy.&para;<br>The Court properly rejects that theory, and I join its&para;<br>opinion in full. The First Amendment protects more than&para;<br>just the individual on a soapbox and the lonely pamphle&para;<br>teer.

This is the same&para;<br>order of operations followed by the controlling opinion in&para;<br>Federal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.,&para;<br>551 U. S. 449 (2007) (WRTL).

This case is different—not, as the&para;<br>dissent suggests, because the approach taken in WRTL&para;<br>has been deemed a “failure,” post, at 11, but because, in&para;<br>the absence of any valid narrower ground of decision,&para;<br>there is no way to avoid Citizens United’s broader consti&para;<br>tutional argument.&para;<br>The dissent advocates an approach to addressing Citi&para;<br>zens United’s claims that I find quite perplexing.

Despite agreeing that&para;<br>these narrower arguments fail, however, the dissent ar&para;<br>gues that the majority should nonetheless latch on to one&para;<br>of them in order to avoid reaching the broader constitu&para;<br>tional question of whether Austin remains good law. It&para;<br>even suggests that the Court’s failure to adopt one of these&para;<br>concededly meritless arguments is a sign that the majority&para;<br>is not “serious about judicial restraint.” Post, at 16.&para;<br>This approach is based on a false premise: that our&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v.

It should go without&para;<br>saying, however, that we cannot embrace a narrow ground&para;<br>of decision simply because it is narrow; it must also be&para;<br>right. Thus while it is true that “[i]f it is not necessary to&para;<br>decide more, it is necessary not to decide more,” post, at 14&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted), sometimes it is neces&para;<br>sary to decide more.

Citizens&para;<br>United has a constitutional claim—the Act violates the&para;<br>First Amendment, because it prohibits political speech.&para;<br>The Government has a defense—the Act may be enforced,&para;<br>consistent with the First Amendment, against corpora&para;<br>tions. Whether the claim or the defense prevails is the&para;<br>question before us.&para;<br>Given the nature of that claim and defense, it makes no&para;<br>difference of any substance whether this case is resolved&para;<br>by invalidating the statute on its face or only as applied to&para;<br>Citizens United. Even if considered in as-applied terms, a&para;<br>holding in this case that the Act may not be applied to&para;<br>Citizens United—because corporations as well as indi&para;<br>viduals enjoy the pertinent First Amendment rights—&para;<br>would mean that any other corporation raising the same&para;<br>challenge would also win.

Not a single party in&para;<br>any of those cases asked us to overrule Austin, and as the&para;<br>dissent points out, post, at 4–6, the Court generally does&para;<br>not consider constitutional arguments that have not prop&para;<br>erly been raised. Austin’s validity was therefore not di&para;<br>rectly at issue in the cases the dissent cites. The Court’s&para;<br>unwillingness to overturn Austin in those cases cannot be&para;<br>understood as a reaffirmation of that decision.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Fidelity to precedent—the policy of stare decisis—is vital&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The dissent suggests that I am “much too quick” to reach this con&para;<br>clusion because I “ignore” Citizens United’s narrower arguments.

Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265&para;<br>(1986). Its greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional&para;<br>ideal—the rule of law. It follows that in the unusual&para;<br>circumstance when fidelity to any particular precedent&para;<br>does more to damage this constitutional ideal than to&para;<br>advance it, we must be more willing to depart from that&para;<br>precedent.&para;<br>Thus, for example, if the precedent under consideration&para;<br>itself departed from the Court’s jurisprudence, returning&para;<br>to the “ ‘intrinsically sounder’ doctrine established in prior&para;<br>cases” may “better serv[e] the values of stare decisis than&para;<br>would following [the] more recently decided case inconsis&para;<br>tent with the decisions that came before it.” Adarand&para;<br>Constructors, Inc. v.

First, as the majority explains, that deci&para;<br>sion was an “aberration” insofar as it departed from the&para;<br>robust protections we had granted political speech in our&para;<br>earlier cases. Ante, at 39; see also Buckley, supra; First&para;<br>Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765 (1978).&para;<br>Austin undermined the careful line that Buckley drew to&para;<br>distinguish limits on contributions to candidates from&para;<br>limits on independent expenditures on speech. Buckley&para;<br>rejected the asserted government interest in regulating&para;<br>independent expenditures, concluding that “restrict[ing]&para;<br>the speech of some elements of our society in order to&para;<br>enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the&para;<br>First Amendment.” 424 U. S., at 48–49; see also Bellotti,&para;<br>supra, at 790–791; Citizens Against Rent Con­&para;<br>trol/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290,&para;<br>295 (1981). Austin, however, allowed the Government to&para;<br>prohibit these same expenditures out of concern for “the&para;<br>corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of&para;<br>wealth” in the marketplace of ideas. 494 U. S., at 660.&para;<br>Austin’s reasoning was—and remains—inconsistent with&para;<br>Buckley’s explicit repudiation of any government interest&para;<br>in “equalizing the relative ability of individuals and&para;<br>groups to influence the outcome of elections.” 424 U. S., at&para;<br>48–49.&para;<br>Austin was also inconsistent with Bellotti’s clear rejec&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>tion of the idea that “speech that otherwise would be&para;<br>within the protection of the First Amendment loses that&para;<br>protection simply because its source is a corporation.” 435&para;<br>U. S., at 784. The dissent correctly points out that Bellotti&para;<br>involved a referendum rather than a candidate election,&para;<br>and that Bellotti itself noted this factual distinction, id., at&para;<br>788, n. 26; post, at 52. But this distinction does not ex&para;<br>plain why corporations may be subject to prohibitions on&para;<br>speech in candidate elections when individuals may not.&para;<br>Second, the validity of Austin’s rationale—itself adopted&para;<br>over two “spirited dissents,” Payne, 501 U. S., at 829—has&para;<br>proved to be the consistent subject of dispute among Mem&para;<br>bers of this Court ever since. See, e.g., WRTL, 551 U. S.,&para;<br>at 483 (SCALIA, J., joined by KENNEDY and THOMAS, JJ.,&para;<br>concurring in part and concurring in judgment); McCon­&para;<br>nell, 540 U.

The simple&para;<br>fact that one of our decisions remains controversial is, of&para;<br>course, insufficient to justify overruling it. But it does&para;<br>undermine the precedent’s ability to contribute to the&para;<br>stable and orderly development of the law. In such cir&para;<br>cumstances, it is entirely appropriate for the Court—&para;<br>which in this case is squarely asked to reconsider Austin’s&para;<br>validity for the first time—to address the matter with a&para;<br>greater willingness to consider new approaches capable of&para;<br>restoring our doctrine to sounder footing.&para;<br>Third, the Austin decision is uniquely destabilizing&para;<br>because it threatens to subvert our Court’s decisions even&para;<br>outside the particular context of corporate express advo&para;<br>cacy. The First Amendment theory underlying Austin’s&para;<br>holding is extraordinarily broad. Austin’s logic would&para;<br>authorize government prohibition of political speech by a&para;<br>category of speakers in the name of equality—a point that&para;<br>most scholars acknowledge (and many celebrate), but that&para;<br>the dissent denies.

A&para;<br>speaker’s ability to persuade, however, provides no basis&para;<br>for government regulation of free and open public debate&para;<br>on what the laws should be.&para;<br>If taken seriously, Austin’s logic would apply most di&para;<br>rectly to newspapers and other media corporations. They&para;<br>have a more profound impact on public discourse than&para;<br>most other speakers. These corporate entities are, for the&para;<br>time being, not subject to §441b’s otherwise generally&para;<br>applicable prohibitions on corporate political speech. But&para;<br>this is simply a matter of legislative grace. The fact that&para;<br>the law currently grants a favored position to media cor&para;<br>porations is no reason to overlook the danger inherent in&para;<br>accepting a theory that would allow government restric&para;<br>tions on their political speech. See generally McConnell,&para;<br>supra, at 283–286 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part, concur&para;<br>ring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part).&para;<br>These readings of Austin do no more than carry that&para;<br>decision’s reasoning to its logical endpoint. In doing so,&para;<br>they highlight the threat Austin poses to First Amend&para;<br>ment rights generally, even outside its specific factual&para;<br>context of corporate express advocacy. Because Austin is&para;<br>so difficult to confine to its facts—and because its logic&para;<br>threatens to undermine our First Amendment jurispru&para;<br>dence and the nature of public discourse more broadly—&para;<br>the costs of giving it stare decisis effect are unusually high.&para;<br>Finally and most importantly, the Government’s own&para;<br>effort to defend Austin—or, more accurately, to defend&para;<br>something that is not quite Austin—underscores its weak&para;<br>ness as a precedent of the Court.

But while invoking stare decisis to support this&para;<br>position, the Government never once even mentions the&para;<br>compelling interest that Austin relied upon in the first&para;<br>place: the need to diminish “the corrosive and distorting&para;<br>effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accu&para;<br>mulated with the help of the corporate form and that have&para;<br>little or no correlation to the public’s support for the corpo&para;<br>ration’s political ideas.” 494 U.

Stare decisis is a&para;<br>doctrine of preservation, not transformation. It counsels&para;<br>deference to past mistakes, but provides no justification&para;<br>for making new ones. There is therefore no basis for the&para;<br>Court to give precedential sway to reasoning that it has&para;<br>never accepted, simply because that reasoning happens to&para;<br>support a conclusion reached on different grounds that&para;<br>have since been abandoned or discredited.&para;<br>Doing so would undermine the rule-of-law values that&para;<br>justify stare decisis in the first place. It would effectively&para;<br>license the Court to invent and adopt new principles of&para;<br>constitutional law solely for the purpose of rationalizing&para;<br>its past errors, without a proper analysis of whether those&para;<br>principles have merit on their own. This approach would&para;<br>allow the Court’s past missteps to spawn future mistakes,&para;<br>undercutting the very rule-of-law values that stare decisis&para;<br>is designed to protect.&para;<br>None of this is to say that the Government is barred&para;<br>from making new arguments to support the outcome in&para;<br>Austin.

Of course even if the common law was “generally&para;<br>interpreted” to prohibit corporate political expenditures as ultra vires,&para;<br>that would have nothing to do with whether political expenditures that&para;<br>were authorized by a corporation’s charter could constitutionally be&para;<br>suppressed.&para;<br>As additional “[p]ostratification practice,” the dissent notes that the&para;<br>Court “did not recognize any First Amendment protections for corpora&para;<br>tions until the middle part of the 20th century.” Post, at 40, n. 56.

The relative recency of that&para;<br>first case is unsurprising. All of our First Amendment jurisprudence&para;<br>was slow to develop. We did not consider application of the First&para;<br>Amendment to speech restrictions other than prior restraints until&para;<br>1919, see Schenck v. United States, 249 U.

The freedom of “the press” was widely&para;<br>understood to protect the publishing activities of individ&para;<br>ual editors and printers. See McIntyre v. Ohio Elections&para;<br>Comm’n, 514 U.

But these individuals often&para;<br>acted through newspapers, which (much like corporations)&para;<br>had their own names, outlived the individuals who had&para;<br>founded them, could be bought and sold, were sometimes&para;<br>owned by more than one person, and were operated for&para;<br>profit. See generally F. Mott, American Journalism: A&para;<br>History of Newspapers in the United States Through 250&para;<br>Years 3–164 (1941); J.

No one thought that is what it meant.

It is hard to see how this has anything to&para;<br>do with what sort of corruption can be combated by re&para;<br>strictions on political speech. Moreover, if speech can be&para;<br>prohibited because, in the view of the Government, it leads&para;<br>to “moral decay” or does not serve “public ends,” then&para;<br>there is no limit to the Government’s censorship power.&para;<br>The dissent says that when the Framers “constitutional&para;<br>ized the right to free speech in the First Amendment, it&para;<br>was the free speech of individual Americans that they had&para;<br>in mind.” Post, at 37. That is no doubt true. All the&para;<br>provisions of the Bill of Rights set forth the rights of indi&para;<br>vidual men and women—not, for example, of trees or polar&para;<br>bears. But the individual person’s right to speak includes&para;<br>the right to speak in association with other individual&para;<br>persons. Surely the dissent does not believe that speech&para;<br>——————&para;<br>books, pamphlets, or papers without previous restraint; or the unre&para;<br>strained right which every citizen enjoys of publishing his thoughts and&para;<br>opinions, subject only to punishment for publishing what is pernicious&para;<br>to morals or to the peace of the state.” 2 American Dictionary of the&para;<br>English Language (1828) (reprinted 1970).&para;<br>As the Court’s opinion describes, ante, at 36, our jurisprudence&para;<br>agrees with Noah Webster and contradicts the dissent.&para;<br>“The liberty of the press is not confined to newspapers and periodi&para;<br>cals.

Its text offers&para;<br>no foothold for excluding any category of speaker, from&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent says that “ ‘speech’ ” refers to oral communications of&para;<br>human beings, and since corporations are not human beings they&para;<br>cannot speak.

The authorized&para;<br>spokesman of a corporation is a human being, who speaks on behalf of&para;<br>the human beings who have formed that association—just as the&para;<br>spokesman of an unincorporated association speaks on behalf of its&para;<br>members. The power to publish thoughts, no less than the power to&para;<br>speak thoughts, belongs only to human beings, but the dissent sees no&para;<br>problem with a corporation’s enjoying the freedom of the press.&para;<br>The same footnote asserts that “it has been ‘claimed that the notion&para;<br>of institutional speech . . . did not exist in post-revolutionary America.’ ”&para;<br>This is quoted from a law-review article by a Bigelow Fellow at the&para;<br>University of Chicago (Fagundes, State Actors as First Amendment&para;<br>Speakers, 100 Nw.

In declaring §203 of BCRA facially&para;<br>unconstitutional on the ground that corporations’ electoral&para;<br>expenditures may not be regulated any more stringently&para;<br>than those of individuals, the majority decides this case on&para;<br>a basis relinquished below, not included in the questions&para;<br>presented to us by the litigants, and argued here only in&para;<br>response to the Court’s invitation.

These concerns are heightened&para;<br>when judges overrule settled doctrine upon which the&para;<br>legislature has relied. The Court operates with a sledge&para;<br>hammer rather than a scalpel when it strikes down one of&para;<br>Congress’ most significant efforts to regulate the role that&para;<br>corporations and unions play in electoral politics. It com­&para;<br>pounds the offense by implicitly striking down a great&para;<br>many state laws as well.&para;<br>The problem goes still deeper, for the Court does all of&para;<br>this on the basis of pure speculation. Had Citizens United&para;<br>maintained a facial challenge, and thus argued that there&para;<br>are virtually no circumstances in which BCRA §203 can be&para;<br>applied constitutionally, the parties could have developed,&para;<br>through the normal process of litigation, a record about&para;<br>the actual effects of §203, its actual burdens and its actual&para;<br>benefits, on all manner of corporations and unions.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Shortly&para;<br>&para;<br>before Citizens United mooted the issue by abandoning its&para;<br>facial challenge, the Government advised the District Court that it&para;<br>“require[d] time to develop a factual record regarding [the] facial&para;<br>challenge.” 1:07–cv–2240–RCL–RWR, Docket Entry No. 47, p. 4 (Mar.&para;<br>26, 2008).

FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>“Claims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation,” and&para;<br>consequently “raise the risk of premature interpretation of&para;<br>statutes on the basis of factually barebones records.” Id.,&para;<br>at 450 (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case,&para;<br>the record is not simply incomplete or unsatisfactory; it is&para;<br>nonexistent. Congress crafted BCRA in response to a&para;<br>virtual mountain of research on the corruption that previ­&para;<br>ous legislation had failed to avert. The Court now negates&para;<br>Congress’ efforts without a shred of evidence on how §203&para;<br>or its state-law counterparts have been affecting any&para;<br>entity other than Citizens United.5&para;<br>Faced with this gaping empirical hole, the majority&para;<br>throws up its hands. Were we to confine our inquiry to&para;<br>Citizens United’s as-applied challenge, it protests, we&para;<br>would commence an “extended” process of “draw[ing], and&para;<br>then redraw[ing], constitutional lines based on the par­&para;<br>ticular media or technology used to disseminate political&para;<br>speech from a particular speaker.” Ante, at 9.

We&para;<br>likewise have no evidence of how §203 and comparable state laws were&para;<br>expected to affect corporations and unions in the future.&para;<br>It is true, as the majority points out, that the McConnell Court&para;<br>evaluated the facial validity of §203 in light of an extensive record. See&para;<br>ante, at 15. But that record is not before us in this case. And in any&para;<br>event, the majority’s argument for striking down §203 depends on its&para;<br>contention that the statute has proved too “chilling” in practice—and in&para;<br>particular on the contention that the controlling opinion in WRTL, 551&para;<br>U. S. 449 (2007), failed to bring sufficient clarity and “breathing space”&para;<br>to this area of law. See ante, at 12, 16–20. We have no record with&para;<br>which to assess that claim. The Court complains at length about the&para;<br>burdens of complying with §203, but we have no meaningful evidence to&para;<br>show how regulated corporations and unions have experienced its&para;<br>restrictions.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

Yet it is a pervasive feature of regulatory sys­&para;<br>tems that unanticipated events, such as new technologies,&para;<br>may raise some unanticipated difficulties at the margins.&para;<br>The fluid nature of electioneering communications does&para;<br>not make this case special. The fact that a Court can&para;<br>hypothesize situations in which a statute might, at some&para;<br>point down the line, pose some unforeseen as-applied&para;<br>problems, does not come close to meeting the standard for&para;<br>a facial challenge.6&para;<br>The majority proposes several other justifications for the&para;<br>sweep of its ruling. It suggests that a facial ruling is&para;<br>necessary because, if the Court were to continue on its&para;<br>normal course of resolving as-applied challenges as they&para;<br>present themselves, that process would itself run afoul of&para;<br>the First Amendment. See, e.g., ante, at 9 (as-applied&para;<br>review process “would raise questions as to the courts’ own&para;<br>lawful authority”); ibid. (“Courts, too, are bound by the&para;<br>First Amendment”). This suggestion is perplexing. Our&para;<br>colleagues elsewhere trumpet “our duty ‘to say what the&para;<br>law is,’ ” even when our predecessors on the bench and our&para;<br>counterparts in Congress have interpreted the law differ­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Our cases recognize a “type of facial challenge in the First Amend­&para;<br>ment context under which a law may be overturned as impermissibly&para;<br>overbroad because a substantial number of its applications are uncon­&para;<br>stitutional.” Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican&para;<br>Party, 552 U. S. 442, 449, n. 6 (2008) (internal quotation marks omit­&para;<br>ted). Citizens United has not made an overbreadth argument, and&para;<br>“[w]e generally do not apply the strong medicine of overbreadth analy­&para;<br>sis where the parties fail to describe the instances of arguable over­&para;<br>breadth of the contested law,” ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>If our colleagues nonetheless concluded that §203’s fatal flaw is that it&para;<br>affects too much protected speech, they should have invalidated it for&para;<br>overbreadth and given guidance as to which applications are permissi­&para;<br>ble, so that Congress could go about repairing the error.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>ently. Ante, at 49 (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch&para;<br>137, 177 (1803)). We do not typically say what the law is&para;<br>not as a hedge against future judicial error. The possibil­&para;<br>ity that later courts will misapply a constitutional provi­&para;<br>sion does not give us a basis for pretermitting litigation&para;<br>relating to that provision.7&para;<br>The majority suggests that a facial ruling is necessary&para;<br>because anything less would chill too much protected&para;<br>speech. See ante, at 9–10, 12, 16–20. In addition to beg­&para;<br>ging the question what types of corporate spending are&para;<br>constitutionally protected and to what extent, this claim&para;<br>rests on the assertion that some significant number of&para;<br>corporations have been cowed into quiescence by FEC&para;<br>“ ‘censor[ship].’ ” Ante, at 18–19. That assertion is unsub­&para;<br>stantiated, and it is hard to square with practical experi­&para;<br>ence. It is particularly hard to square with the legal land­&para;<br>scape following WRTL, which held that a corporate&para;<br>communication could be regulated under §203 only if it&para;<br>was “susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other&para;<br>than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candi­&para;<br>date.” 551 U. S., at 470 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (em­&para;<br>phasis added). The whole point of this test was to make&para;<br>§203 as simple and speech-protective as possible. The&para;<br>Court does not explain how, in the span of a single election&para;<br>cycle, it has determined THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s project to be&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 Also perplexing is the majority’s attempt to pass blame to the Gov­&para;<br>ernment for its litigating position. By “hold[ing] out the possibility of&para;<br>ruling for Citizens United on a narrow ground yet refrain[ing] from&para;<br>adopting that position,” the majority says, the Government has caused&para;<br>“added uncertainty [that] demonstrates the necessity to address the&para;<br>question of statutory validity.” Ante, at 17. Our colleagues have&para;<br>apparently never heard of an alternative argument. Like every liti­&para;<br>gant, the Government would prefer to win its case outright; failing that,&para;<br>it would prefer to lose on a narrow ground. The fact that there are&para;<br>numerous different ways this case could be decided, and that the&para;<br>Government acknowledges as much, does not demonstrate anything&para;<br>about the propriety of a facial ruling.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>a failure. In this respect, too, the majority’s critique of&para;<br>line-drawing collapses into a critique of the as-applied&para;<br>review method generally.8&para;<br>The majority suggests that, even though it expressly&para;<br>dismissed its facial challenge, Citizens United neverthe­&para;<br>less preserved it—not as a freestanding “claim,” but as a&para;<br>potential argument in support of “a claim that the FEC&para;<br>has violated its First Amendment right to free speech.”&para;<br>Ante, at 13; see also ante, at 4 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring)&para;<br>(describing Citizens United’s claim as: “[T]he Act violates&para;<br>the First Amendment”). By this novel logic, virtually any&para;<br>submission could be reconceptualized as “a claim that the&para;<br>Government has violated my rights,” and it would then be&para;<br>available to the Court to entertain any conceivable issue&para;<br>that might be relevant to that claim’s disposition. Not&para;<br>only the as-applied/facial distinction, but the basic rela­&para;<br>tionship between litigants and courts, would be upended if&para;<br>the latter had free rein to construe the former’s claims at&para;<br>such high levels of generality. There would be no need for&para;<br>plaintiffs to argue their case; they could just cite the con­&para;<br>stitutional provisions they think relevant, and leave the&para;<br>rest to us.9&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The majority’s “chilling” argument is particularly inapposite with&para;<br>respect to 2 U. S. C. §441b’s longstanding restriction on the use of&para;<br>corporate general treasury funds for express advocacy. If there was&para;<br>ever any significant uncertainty about what counts as the functional&para;<br>equivalent of express advocacy, there has been little doubt about what&para;<br>counts as express advocacy since the “magic words” test of Buckley v.&para;<br>Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 44, n. 52 (1976) (per curiam). Yet even though&para;<br>Citizens United’s briefs never once mention §441b’s restriction on&para;<br>express advocacy; even though this restriction does not generate&para;<br>chilling concerns; and even though no one has suggested that Hillary&para;<br>counts as express advocacy; the majority nonetheless reaches out to&para;<br>opine that this statutory provision is “invalid” as well. Ante, at 50.&para;<br>9 The majority adds that the distinction between facial and as-applied&para;<br>challenges does not have “some automatic effect” that mechanically&para;<br>controls the judicial task. Ante, at 14. I agree, but it does not follow&para;<br>that in any given case we should ignore the distinction, much less&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Finally, the majority suggests that though the scope of&para;<br>Citizens United’s claim may be narrow, a facial ruling is&para;<br>necessary as a matter of remedy. Relying on a law review&para;<br>article, it asserts that Citizens United’s dismissal of the&para;<br>facial challenge does not prevent us “ ‘from making&para;<br>broader pronouncements of invalidity in properly “as­&para;<br>applied” cases.’ ” Ante, at 14 (quoting Fallon, As-Applied&para;<br>and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113&para;<br>Harv.

(“Regardless&para;<br>whether we label Citizens United’s claim a ‘facial’ or ‘as­&para;<br>applied’ challenge, the consequences of the Court’s deci­&para;<br>sion are the same”). The majority is on firmer conceptual&para;<br>ground here. Yet even if one accepts this part of Professor&para;<br>Fallon’s thesis, one must proceed to ask which as-applied&para;<br>challenges, if successful, will “properly” invite or entail&para;<br>invalidation of the underlying statute.10 The paradigmatic&para;<br>case is a judicial determination that the legislature acted&para;<br>with an impermissible purpose in enacting a provision, as&para;<br>this carries the necessary implication that all future as­&para;<br>applied challenges to the provision must prevail. See&para;<br>Fallon 1339–1340.&para;<br>Citizens United’s as-applied challenge was not of this&para;<br>sort.

That&para;<br>conclusion would only follow if the Court were to ignore Citizens&para;<br>United’s plausible as-applied arguments and instead take the implau­&para;<br>sible position that all corporations and all types of expenditures enjoy&para;<br>the same First Amendment protections, which always trump the&para;<br>interests in regulation. At times, the majority appears to endorse this&para;<br>extreme view. At other times, however, it appears to suggest that&para;<br>nonprofit corporations have a better claim to First Amendment protec­&para;<br>tion than for-profit corporations, see ante, at 20, 39, “advocacy” organi­&para;<br>zations have a better claim than other nonprofits, ante, at 20, domestic&para;<br>corporations have a better claim than foreign corporations, ante, at 46–&para;<br>47, small corporations have a better claim than large corporations,&para;<br>ante, at 38–40, and printed matter has a better claim than broadcast&para;<br>communications, ante, at 33.

Which is to say, the majority has trans­&para;<br>gressed yet another “cardinal” principle of the judicial&para;<br>process: “[I]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is neces­&para;<br>sary not to decide more,” PDK Labs., Inc. v.

First, the Court could&para;<br>have ruled, on statutory grounds, that a feature-length&para;<br>film distributed through video-on-demand does not qualify&para;<br>as an “electioneering communication” under §203 of&para;<br>BCRA, 2 U. S. C. §441b. BCRA defines that term to en­&para;<br>compass certain communications transmitted by “broad­&para;<br>cast, cable, or satellite.” §434(f)(3)(A). When Congress&para;<br>was developing BCRA, the video-on-demand medium was&para;<br>still in its infancy, and legislators were focused on a very&para;<br>different sort of programming: short advertisements run&para;<br>on television or radio. See McConnell, 540 U.

In light of this&para;<br>ambiguity, the distinctive characteristics of video-on­&para;<br>demand, and “[t]he elementary rule . . . that every reason­&para;<br>able construction must be resorted to, in order to save a&para;<br>statute from unconstitutionality,” Hooper v.

It concludes&para;<br>that §203 applies to Hillary on the basis of the film’s content, ante, at&para;<br>7–8, without considering the possibility that §203 does not apply to&para;<br>video-on-demand transmissions generally.&para;<br>14 See Colorado Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Coffman, 498 F. 3d 1137,&para;<br>1148 (CA10 2007) (adopting this rule and noting that “every other&para;<br>circuit to have addressed this issue” has done likewise); Brief for&para;<br>Independent Sector as Amicus Curiae 10–11 (collecting cases). The&para;<br>Court rejects this solution in part because the Government “merely&para;<br>suggest[s] it” and “does not say that it agrees with the interpretation.”&para;<br>Ante, at 11. Our colleagues would thus punish a defendant for showing&para;<br>insufficient excitement about a ground it has advanced, at the same&para;<br>time that they decide the case on a ground the plaintiff expressly&para;<br>abandoned. The Court also protests that a de minimis standard would&para;<br>“requir[e] intricate case-by-case determinations.” Ante, at 12. But de&para;<br>minimis tests need not be intricate at all. A test that granted MCFL&para;<br>status to §501(c)(4) organizations if they received less than a fixed&para;<br>dollar amount of business donations in the previous year, or if such&para;<br>donations represent less than a fixed percentage of their total assets,&para;<br>would be perfectly easy to understand and administer.&para;<br>15 Another bypassed ground, not briefed by the parties, would have&para;<br>been to revive the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment in BCRA §203(c),&para;<br>allowing certain nonprofit corporations to pay for electioneering com­&para;<br>munications with general treasury funds, to the extent they can trace&para;<br>the payments to individual contributions.

As the appellant’s own&para;<br>arguments show, the Court could have easily limited the&para;<br>breadth of its constitutional holding had it declined to&para;<br>adopt the novel notion that speakers and speech acts must&para;<br>always be treated identically—and always spared expendi­&para;<br>tures restrictions—in the political realm. Yet the Court&para;<br>nonetheless turns its back on the as-applied review proc­&para;<br>ess that has been a staple of campaign finance litigation&para;<br>since Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam), and&para;<br>that was affirmed and expanded just two Terms ago in&para;<br>WRTL, 551 U.

Ante, at 3. There is&para;<br>nothing perplexing about the matter, because we are not similarly&para;<br>situated to our colleagues in the majority. We do not share their view&para;<br>of the First Amendment. Our reading of the Constitution would not&para;<br>lead us to strike down any statutes or overturn any precedents in this&para;<br>case, and we therefore have no occasion to practice constitutional&para;<br>avoidance or to vindicate Citizens United’s as-applied challenge. Each&para;<br>of the arguments made above is surely at least as strong as the statu­&para;<br>tory argument the Court accepted in last year’s Voting Rights Act case,&para;<br>Northwest Austin Municipal Util.

The only thing preventing the majority from&para;<br>affirming the District Court, or adopting a narrower&para;<br>ground that would retain Austin, is its disdain for Austin.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The final principle of judicial process that the majority&para;<br>violates is the most transparent: stare decisis. I am not an&para;<br>absolutist when it comes to stare decisis, in the campaign&para;<br>finance area or in any other. No one is. But if this princi­&para;<br>ple is to do any meaningful work in supporting the rule of&para;<br>law, it must at least demand a significant justification,&para;<br>beyond the preferences of five Justices, for overturning&para;<br>settled doctrine. “[A] decision to overrule should rest on&para;<br>some special reason over and above the belief that a prior&para;<br>case was wrongly decided.” Planned Parenthood of South&para;<br>eastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 864 (1992). No such&para;<br>justification exists in this case, and to the contrary there&para;<br>are powerful prudential reasons to keep faith with our&para;<br>precedents.17&para;<br>The Court’s central argument for why stare decisis&para;<br>ought to be trumped is that it does not like Austin. The&para;<br>opinion “was not well reasoned,” our colleagues assert, and&para;<br>it conflicts with First Amendment principles. Ante, at 47–&para;<br>48. This, of course, is the Court’s merits argument, the&para;<br>many defects in which we will soon consider. I am per­&para;<br>fectly willing to concede that if one of our precedents were&para;<br>dead wrong in its reasoning or irreconcilable with the rest&para;<br>of our doctrine, there would be a compelling basis for&para;<br>revisiting it. But neither is true of Austin, as I explain at&para;<br>length in Parts III and IV, infra, at 23–89, and restating a&para;<br>merits argument with additional vigor does not give it&para;<br>——————&para;<br>17 I&para;<br>&para;<br>will have more to say shortly about the merits—about why Austin&para;<br>and McConnell are not doctrinal outliers, as the Court contends, and&para;<br>why their logic is not only defensible but also compelling. For present&para;<br>purposes, I limit the discussion to stare-decisis-specific considerations.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>extra weight in the stare decisis calculus.&para;<br>Perhaps in recognition of this point, the Court supple­&para;<br>ments its merits case with a smattering of assertions. The&para;<br>Court proclaims that “Austin is undermined by experience&para;<br>since its announcement.” Ante, at 48. This is a curious&para;<br>claim to make in a case that lacks a developed record. The&para;<br>majority has no empirical evidence with which to substan­&para;<br>tiate the claim; we just have its ipse dixit that the real&para;<br>world has not been kind to Austin. Nor does the majority&para;<br>bother to specify in what sense Austin has been “under­&para;<br>mined.” Instead it treats the reader to a string of non&para;<br>sequiturs: “Our Nation’s speech dynamic is changing,”&para;<br>ante, at 48; “[s]peakers have become adept at presenting&para;<br>citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted&para;<br>messages,” ibid.; “[c]orporations . . . do not have monolithic&para;<br>views,” ibid. How any of these ruminations weakens the&para;<br>force of stare decisis, escapes my comprehension.18&para;<br>The majority also contends that the Government’s hesi­&para;<br>tation to rely on Austin’s antidistortion rationale “dimin­&para;<br>ishe[s]” “the principle of adhering to that precedent.”&para;<br>Ante, at 48; see also ante, at 11 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.)&para;<br>(Government’s litigating position is “most importan[t]”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>18 THE CHIEF JUSTICE suggests that Austin has been undermined by&para;<br>subsequent dissenting opinions. Ante, at 9. Under this view, it appears&para;<br>that the more times the Court stands by a precedent in the face of&para;<br>requests to overrule it, the weaker that precedent becomes. THE CHIEF&para;<br>JUSTICE further suggests that Austin “is uniquely destabilizing because&para;<br>it threatens to subvert our Court’s decisions even outside” its particular&para;<br>facts, as when we applied its reasoning in McConnell. Ante, at 9. Once&para;<br>again, the theory seems to be that the more we utilize a precedent, the&para;<br>more we call it into question. For those who believe Austin was cor­&para;<br>rectly decided—as the Federal Government and the States have long&para;<br>believed, as the majority of Justices to have served on the Court since&para;<br>Austin have believed, and as we continue to believe—there is nothing&para;<br>“destabilizing” about the prospect of its continued application. It is&para;<br>gutting campaign finance laws across the country, as the Court does&para;<br>today, that will be destabilizing.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

Why it diminishes the value&para;<br>of stare decisis is left unexplained. We have never thought&para;<br>fit to overrule a precedent because a litigant has taken&para;<br>any particular tack. Nor should we. Our decisions can&para;<br>often be defended on multiple grounds, and a litigant may&para;<br>have strategic or case-specific reasons for emphasizing&para;<br>only a subset of them. Members of the public, moreover,&para;<br>often rely on our bottom-line holdings far more than our&para;<br>precise legal arguments; surely this is true for the legisla­&para;<br>tures that have been regulating corporate electioneering&para;<br>since Austin. The task of evaluating the continued viabil­&para;<br>ity of precedents falls to this Court, not to the parties.19&para;<br>Although the majority opinion spends several pages&para;<br>making these surprising arguments, it says almost noth­&para;<br>ing about the standard considerations we have used to&para;<br>determine stare decisis value, such as the antiquity of the&para;<br>precedent, the workability of its legal rule, and the reli­&para;<br>ance interests at stake. It is also conspicuously silent&para;<br>about McConnell, even though the McConnell Court’s&para;<br>decision to uphold BCRA §203 relied not only on the anti­&para;<br>distortion logic of Austin but also on the statute’s histori­&para;<br>cal pedigree, see, e.g., 540 U.

Even&para;<br>if the scholarship cited by the majority is correct that certain campaign&para;<br>finance reforms were less deliberate or less benignly motivated than&para;<br>Automobile Workers suggested, the point remains that this body of law&para;<br>has played a significant and broadly accepted role in American political&para;<br>life for decades upon decades.&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v.

As for McConnell, the portions of BCRA&para;<br>it upheld may be prolix, but all three branches of Govern­&para;<br>ment have worked to make §203 as user-friendly as possi­&para;<br>ble. For instance, Congress established a special mecha­&para;<br>nism for expedited review of constitutional challenges, see&para;<br>note following 2 U. S.

See Aristotle, Poetics 43–44 (M.

The insight that the identity of speakers is a proper&para;<br>subject of regulatory concern, it bears noting, motivates the disclaimer&para;<br>and disclosure provisions that the Court today upholds.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

First, we learn from it that the drafters of the&para;<br>First Amendment did draw distinctions—explicit distinctions—between&para;<br>types of “speakers,” or speech outlets or forms. Second, the Court’s&para;<br>strongest historical evidence all relates to the Framers’ views on the&para;<br>press, see ante, at 37–38; ante, at 4–6 (SCALIA, J., concurring), yet while&para;<br>the Court tries to sweep this evidence into the Free Speech Clause, the&para;<br>Free Press Clause provides a more natural textual home.

The majority suggests that&para;<br>Austin rests on the foreign concept of speech equalization,&para;<br>ante, at 34; ante, at 8–10 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.

The only thing about Bellotti&para;<br>that could not be clearer is that it declined to adopt the&para;<br>majority’s position. Bellotti ruled, in an explicit limitation&para;<br>on the scope of its holding, that “our consideration of a&para;<br>corporation’s right to speak on issues of general public&para;<br>interest implies no comparable right in the quite different&para;<br>context of participation in a political campaign for election&para;<br>to public office.” 435 U.

Bellotti, in other words, did not&para;<br>touch the question presented in Austin and McConnell,&para;<br>and the opinion squarely disavowed the proposition for&para;<br>which the majority cites it.&para;<br>The majority attempts to explain away the distinction&para;<br>Bellotti drew—between general corporate speech and&para;<br>campaign speech intended to promote or prevent the&para;<br>election of specific candidates for office—as inconsistent&para;<br>with the rest of the opinion and with Buckley.

A referendum cannot owe a&para;<br>political debt to a corporation, seek to curry favor with a&para;<br>corporation, or fear the corporation’s retaliation. Cf. Aus&para;<br>tin, 494 U.

The majority likewise&para;<br>overlooks the fact that, over the past 30 years, our cases&para;<br>have repeatedly recognized the candidate/issue distinc­&para;<br>tion. See, e.g., Austin, 494 U.

The Court’s critique of Bellotti’s footnote 26 puts it in&para;<br>the strange position of trying to elevate Bellotti to canoni­&para;<br>cal status, while simultaneously disparaging a critical&para;<br>piece of its analysis as unsupported and irreconcilable&para;<br>with Buckley. Bellotti, apparently, is both the font of all&para;<br>wisdom and internally incoherent.&para;<br>The Bellotti Court confronted a dramatically different&para;<br>factual situation from the one that confronts us in this&para;<br>case: a state statute that barred business corporations’&para;<br>expenditures on some referenda but not others. Specifi­&para;<br>cally, the statute barred a business corporation “from&para;<br>making contributions or expenditures ‘for the purpose of&para;<br>. . . influencing or affecting the vote on any question sub­&para;<br>mitted to the voters, other than one materially affecting&para;<br>any of the property, business or assets of the corporation,’ ”&para;<br>435 U. S., at 768 (quoting Mass. Gen.

S., at&para;<br>768. As might be guessed, the legislature had enacted this&para;<br>statute in order to limit corporate speech on a proposed&para;<br>&para;<br>54&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>state constitutional amendment to authorize a graduated&para;<br>income tax. The statute was a transparent attempt to&para;<br>prevent corporations from spending money to defeat this&para;<br>amendment, which was favored by a majority of legislators&para;<br>but had been repeatedly rejected by the voters. See id., at&para;<br>769–770, and n. 3. We said that “where, as here, the&para;<br>legislature’s suppression of speech suggests an attempt to&para;<br>give one side of a debatable public question an advantage&para;<br>in expressing its views to the people, the First Amendment&para;<br>is plainly offended.” Id., at 785–786 (footnote omitted).&para;<br>Bellotti thus involved a viewpoint-discriminatory stat­&para;<br>ute, created to effect a particular policy outcome. Even&para;<br>Justice Rehnquist, in dissent, had to acknowledge that “a&para;<br>very persuasive argument could be made that the [Massa­&para;<br>chusetts Legislature], desiring to impose a personal in­&para;<br>come tax but more than once defeated in that desire by the&para;<br>combination of the Commonwealth’s referendum provision&para;<br>and corporate expenditures in opposition to such a tax,&para;<br>simply decided to muzzle corporations on this sort of issue&para;<br>so that it could succeed in its desire.” Id., at 827, n. 6. To&para;<br>make matters worse, the law at issue did not make any&para;<br>allowance for corporations to spend money through PACs.&para;<br>Id., at 768, n. 2 (opinion of the Court). This really was a&para;<br>complete ban on a specific, preidentified subject. See&para;<br>MCFL, 479 U. S., at 259, n. 12 (stating that 2 U. S. C.&para;<br>§441b’s expenditure restriction “is of course distinguish&para;<br>able from the complete foreclosure of any opportunity for&para;<br>political speech that we invalidated in the state referen­&para;<br>dum context in . . .

See McConnell, 540 U. S., at&para;<br>205; Austin, 494 U. S., at 658, 660. We acknowledged in&para;<br>Bellotti that numerous “interests of the highest impor­&para;<br>tance” can justify campaign finance regulation. 435 U. S.,&para;<br>at 788–789. But we found no evidence that these interests&para;<br>were served by the Massachusetts law. Id., at 789. We&para;<br>left open the possibility that our decision might have been&para;<br>different if there had been “record or legislative findings&para;<br>that corporate advocacy threatened imminently to under­&para;<br>mine democratic processes, thereby denigrating rather&para;<br>than serving First Amendment interests.” Ibid.&para;<br>Austin and McConnell, then, sit perfectly well with&para;<br>Bellotti. Indeed, all six Members of the Austin majority&para;<br>had been on the Court at the time of Bellotti, and none so&para;<br>much as hinted in Austin that they saw any tension be­&para;<br>tween the decisions. The difference between the cases is&para;<br>not that Austin and McConnell rejected First Amendment&para;<br>protection for corporations whereas Bellotti accepted it.&para;<br>The difference is that the statute at issue in Bellotti&para;<br>smacked of viewpoint discrimination, targeted one class of&para;<br>corporations, and provided no PAC option; and the State&para;<br>has a greater interest in regulating independent corporate&para;<br>expenditures on candidate elections than on referenda,&para;<br>because in a functioning democracy the public must have&para;<br>faith that its representatives owe their positions to the&para;<br>people, not to the corporations with the deepest pockets.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>In sum, over the course of the past century Congress has&para;<br>demonstrated a recurrent need to regulate corporate&para;<br>participation in candidate elections to “ ‘[p]reserv[e] the&para;<br>integrity of the electoral process, preven[t] corruption, . . .&para;<br>sustai[n] the active, alert responsibility of the individual&para;<br>citizen,’ ” protect the expressive interests of shareholders,&para;<br>and “ ‘[p]reserv[e] . . . the individual citizen’s confidence in&para;<br>&para;<br>56&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v.

Ante, at 32–&para;<br>46. It badly errs both in explaining the nature of these&para;<br>rationales, which overlap and complement each other, and&para;<br>in applying them to the case at hand.&para;<br>The Anticorruption Interest&para;<br>Undergirding the majority’s approach to the merits is&para;<br>the claim that the only “sufficiently important governmen­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

This is the same “crabbed view of&para;<br>corruption” that was espoused by JUSTICE KENNEDY in&para;<br>McConnell and squarely rejected by the Court in that case.&para;<br>540 U. S., at 152. While it is true that we have not always&para;<br>spoken about corruption in a clear or consistent voice, the&para;<br>approach taken by the majority cannot be right, in my&para;<br>judgment. It disregards our constitutional history and the&para;<br>fundamental demands of a democratic society.&para;<br>On numerous occasions we have recognized Congress’&para;<br>legitimate interest in preventing the money that is spent&para;<br>on elections from exerting an “ ‘undue influence on an&para;<br>officeholder’s judgment’ ” and from creating “ ‘the appear­&para;<br>ance of such influence,’ ” beyond the sphere of quid pro quo&para;<br>relationships. Id., at 150; see also, e.g., id., at 143–144,&para;<br>152–154; Colorado II, 533 U. S., at 441; Shrink Missouri,&para;<br>528 U. S., at 389. Corruption can take many forms. Brib­&para;<br>ery may be the paradigm case. But the difference between&para;<br>selling a vote and selling access is a matter of degree, not&para;<br>kind. And selling access is not qualitatively different from&para;<br>giving special preference to those who spent money on&para;<br>one’s behalf. Corruption operates along a spectrum, and&para;<br>the majority’s apparent belief that quid pro quo arrange­&para;<br>ments can be neatly demarcated from other improper&para;<br>influences does not accord with the theory or reality of&para;<br>politics. It certainly does not accord with the record Con­&para;<br>gress developed in passing BCRA, a record that stands as&para;<br>a remarkable testament to the energy and ingenuity with&para;<br>which corporations, unions, lobbyists, and politicians may&para;<br>go about scratching each other’s backs—and which amply&para;<br>supported Congress’ determination to target a limited set&para;<br>of especially destructive practices.&para;<br>The District Court that adjudicated the initial challenge&para;<br>to BCRA pored over this record. In a careful analysis,&para;<br>Judge Kollar-Kotelly made numerous findings about the&para;<br>&para;<br>58&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>corrupting consequences of corporate and union independ­&para;<br>ent expenditures in the years preceding BCRA’s passage.&para;<br>See McConnell, 251 F.

As summarized in her own words:&para;<br>“The factual findings of the Court illustrate that&para;<br>corporations and labor unions routinely notify Mem­&para;<br>bers of Congress as soon as they air electioneering&para;<br>communications relevant to the Members’ elections.&para;<br>The record also indicates that Members express ap­&para;<br>preciation to organizations for the airing of these elec­&para;<br>tion-related advertisements.&para;<br>Indeed, Members of&para;<br>Congress are particularly grateful when negative is­&para;<br>sue advertisements are run by these organizations,&para;<br>leaving the candidates free to run positive advertise­&para;<br>ments and be seen as ‘above the fray.’ Political con­&para;<br>sultants testify that campaigns are quite aware of&para;<br>who is running advertisements on the candidate’s be­&para;<br>half, when they are being run, and where they are be­&para;<br>ing run. Likewise, a prominent lobbyist testifies that&para;<br>these organizations use issue advocacy as a means to&para;<br>influence various Members of Congress.&para;<br>“The Findings also demonstrate that Members of&para;<br>Congress seek to have corporations and unions run&para;<br>these advertisements on their behalf. The Findings&para;<br>show that Members suggest that corporations or indi­&para;<br>viduals make donations to interest groups with the&para;<br>understanding that the money contributed to these&para;<br>groups will assist the Member in a campaign. After&para;<br>the election, these organizations often seek credit for&para;<br>their support. . . . Finally, a large majority of Ameri­&para;<br>cans (80%) are of the view that corporations and other&para;<br>organizations that engage in electioneering communi­&para;<br>cations, which benefit specific elected officials, receive&para;<br>special consideration from those officials when matters&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

Her analysis&para;<br>shows the great difficulty in delimiting the precise scope of&para;<br>the quid pro quo category, as well as the adverse conse­&para;<br>quences that all such arrangements may have. There are&para;<br>threats of corruption that are far more destructive to a&para;<br>democratic society than the odd bribe. Yet the majority’s&para;<br>understanding of corruption would leave lawmakers impo­&para;<br>tent to address all but the most discrete abuses.&para;<br>Our “undue influence” cases have allowed the American&para;<br>people to cast a wider net through legislative experiments&para;<br>designed to ensure, to some minimal extent, “that office­&para;<br>holders will decide issues . . . on the merits or the desires&para;<br>of their constituencies,” and not “according to the wishes of&para;<br>those who have made large financial contributions”—or&para;<br>expenditures—“valued by the officeholder.” McConnell,&para;<br>540 U. S., at 153.63 When private interests are seen to&para;<br>exert outsized control over officeholders solely on account&para;<br>of the money spent on (or withheld from) their campaigns,&para;<br>the result can depart so thoroughly “from what is pure or&para;<br>——————&para;<br>63 Cf.&para;<br>&para;<br>Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 389&para;<br>(2000) (recognizing “the broader threat from politicians too compliant&para;<br>with the wishes of large contributors”). Though discrete in scope, these&para;<br>experiments must impose some meaningful limits if they are to have a&para;<br>chance at functioning effectively and preserving the public’s trust.&para;<br>“Even if it occurs only occasionally, the potential for such undue influ­&para;<br>ence is manifest. And unlike straight cash-for-votes transactions, such&para;<br>corruption is neither easily detected nor practical to criminalize.”&para;<br>McConnell, 540 U. S., at 153. There should be nothing controversial&para;<br>about the proposition that the influence being targeted is “undue.” In a&para;<br>democracy, officeholders should not make public decisions with the aim&para;<br>of placating a financial benefactor, except to the extent that the bene­&para;<br>factor is seen as representative of a larger constituency or its argu­&para;<br>ments are seen as especially persuasive.&para;<br>&para;<br>60&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v.

At&para;<br>stake in the legislative efforts to address this threat is&para;<br>therefore not only the legitimacy and quality of Govern­&para;<br>ment but also the public’s faith therein, not only “the&para;<br>capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents&para;<br>[but also] the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to&para;<br>govern themselves,” WRTL, 551 U.

Long before Buckley, we appreciated that “[t]o&para;<br>say that Congress is without power to pass appropriate&para;<br>legislation to safeguard . . . an election from the improper&para;<br>use of money to influence the result is to deny to the na­&para;<br>tion in a vital particular the power of self protection.”&para;<br>Burroughs v.

It is fair to say that&para;<br>“[t]he Framers were obsessed with corruption,” Teachout&para;<br>348, which they understood to encompass the dependency&para;<br>of public officeholders on private interests, see id., at 373–&para;<br>374; see also Randall, 548 U. S., at 280 (STEVENS, J.,&para;<br>dissenting). They discussed corruption “more often in the&para;<br>Constitutional Convention than factions, violence, or&para;<br>instability.” Teachout 352.

Even under the majority’s&para;<br>“crabbed view of corruption,” McConnell, 540 U.

S., at 788, n. 26.&para;<br>Even in the cases that have construed the anticorruption&para;<br>interest most narrowly, we have never suggested that&para;<br>such quid pro quo debts must take the form of outright&para;<br>vote buying or bribes, which have long been distinct&para;<br>crimes. Rather, they encompass the myriad ways in which&para;<br>outside parties may induce an officeholder to confer a&para;<br>legislative benefit in direct response to, or anticipation of,&para;<br>some outlay of money the parties have made or will make&para;<br>on behalf of the officeholder. See McConnell, 540 U. S., at&para;<br>143 (“We have not limited [the anticorruption] interest to&para;<br>the elimination of cash-for-votes exchanges. In Buckley,&para;<br>we expressly rejected the argument that antibribery laws&para;<br>provided a less restrictive alternative to FECA’s contribu­&para;<br>tion limits, noting that such laws ‘deal[t] with only the&para;<br>most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to&para;<br>influence governmental action’ ” (quoting 424 U. S., at 28;&para;<br>alteration in original)). It has likewise never been doubted&para;<br>that “[o]f almost equal concern as the danger of actual&para;<br>quid pro quo arrangements is the impact of the appear­&para;<br>ance of corruption.” Id., at 27. Congress may “legiti­&para;<br>mately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of&para;<br>improper influence is also critical . . . if confidence in the&para;<br>system of representative Government is not to be eroded&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

A democracy cannot func­&para;<br>tion effectively when its constituent members believe laws&para;<br>are being bought and sold.&para;<br>In theory, our colleagues accept this much. As applied&para;<br>to BCRA §203, however, they conclude “[t]he anticorrup­&para;<br>tion interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in&para;<br>question.” Ante, at 41.&para;<br>Although the Court suggests that Buckley compels its&para;<br>conclusion, ante, at 40–44, Buckley cannot sustain this&para;<br>reading. It is true that, in evaluating FECA’s ceiling on&para;<br>independent expenditures by all persons, the Buckley&para;<br>Court found the governmental interest in preventing&para;<br>corruption “inadequate.” 424 U. S., at 45. But Buckley did&para;<br>not evaluate corporate expenditures specifically, nor did it&para;<br>rule out the possibility that a future Court might find&para;<br>otherwise. The opinion reasoned that an expenditure&para;<br>limitation covering only express advocacy (i.e., magic&para;<br>words) would likely be ineffectual, ibid., a problem that&para;<br>Congress tackled in BCRA, and it concluded that “the&para;<br>independent advocacy restricted by [FECA §608(e)(1)] does&para;<br>not presently appear to pose dangers of real or apparent&para;<br>corruption comparable to those identified with large cam­&para;<br>paign contributions,” id., at 46 (emphasis added). Buckley&para;<br>expressly contemplated that an anticorruption rationale&para;<br>might justify restrictions on independent expenditures at&para;<br>a later date, “because it may be that, in some circum­&para;<br>stances, ‘large independent expenditures pose the same&para;<br>dangers of actual or apparent quid pro quo arrangements&para;<br>as do large contributions.’ ” WRTL, 551 U. S., at 478&para;<br>(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (quoting Buckley, 424 U. S., at&para;<br>45). Certainly Buckley did not foreclose this possibility&para;<br>with respect to electioneering communications made with&para;<br>corporate general treasury funds, an issue the Court had&para;<br>no occasion to consider.&para;<br>The Austin Court did not rest its holding on quid pro&para;<br>&para;<br>64&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v.

S., at 658–660. Concur­&para;<br>ring in that opinion, I took the position that “the danger of&para;<br>either the fact, or the appearance, of quid pro quo rela­&para;<br>tionships [also] provides an adequate justification for state&para;<br>regulation” of these independent expenditures. Id., at 678.&para;<br>I did not see this position as inconsistent with Buckley’s&para;<br>analysis of individual expenditures. Corporations, as a&para;<br>class, tend to be more attuned to the complexities of the&para;<br>legislative process and more directly affected by tax and&para;<br>appropriations measures that receive little public scrutiny;&para;<br>they also have vastly more money with which to try to buy&para;<br>access and votes. See Supp. Brief for Appellee 17 (stating&para;<br>that the Fortune 100 companies earned revenues of $13.1&para;<br>trillion during the last election cycle). Business corpora­&para;<br>tions must engage the political process in instrumental&para;<br>terms if they are to maximize shareholder value. The&para;<br>unparalleled resources, professional lobbyists, and single­&para;<br>minded focus they bring to this effort, I believed, make&para;<br>quid pro quo corruption and its appearance inherently&para;<br>more likely when they (or their conduits or trade groups)&para;<br>spend unrestricted sums on elections.&para;<br>It is with regret rather than satisfaction that I can now&para;<br>say that time has borne out my concerns. The legislative&para;<br>and judicial proceedings relating to BCRA generated a&para;<br>substantial body of evidence suggesting that, as corpora­&para;<br>tions grew more and more adept at crafting “issue ads” to&para;<br>help or harm a particular candidate, these nominally&para;<br>independent expenditures began to corrupt the political&para;<br>process in a very direct sense. The sponsors of these ads&para;<br>were routinely granted special access after the campaign&para;<br>was over; “candidates and officials knew who their friends&para;<br>were,” McConnell, 540 U. S., at 129. Many corporate&para;<br>independent expenditures, it seemed, had become essen­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>65&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>tially interchangeable with direct contributions in their&para;<br>capacity to generate quid pro quo arrangements. In an&para;<br>age in which money and television ads are the coin of the&para;<br>campaign realm, it is hardly surprising that corporations&para;<br>deployed these ads to curry favor with, and to gain influ­&para;<br>ence over, public officials.&para;<br>The majority appears to think it decisive that the BCRA&para;<br>record does not contain “direct examples of votes being&para;<br>exchanged for . . . expenditures.” Ante, at 45 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). It would have been quite re­&para;<br>markable if Congress had created a record detailing such&para;<br>behavior by its own Members. Proving that a specific vote&para;<br>was exchanged for a specific expenditure has always been&para;<br>next to impossible: Elected officials have diverse motiva­&para;<br>tions, and no one will acknowledge that he sold a vote.&para;<br>Yet, even if “[i]ngratiation and access . . . are not corrup­&para;<br>tion” themselves, ibid., they are necessary prerequisites to&para;<br>it; they can create both the opportunity for, and the ap­&para;<br>pearance of, quid pro quo arrangements. The influx of&para;<br>unlimited corporate money into the electoral realm also&para;<br>creates new opportunities for the mirror image of quid pro&para;<br>quo deals: threats, both explicit and implicit.

See, e.g.,&para;<br>id., at 478–479. One former Senator candidly admitted to&para;<br>the District Court that “ ‘[c]andidates whose campaigns&para;<br>benefit from [phony “issue ads”] greatly appreciate the&para;<br>help of these groups. In fact, Members will also be favora­&para;<br>bly disposed to those who finance these groups when they&para;<br>later seek access to discuss pending legislation.’ ” Id., at&para;<br>556 (quoting declaration of Sen. Dale Bumpers). One&para;<br>prominent lobbyist went so far as to state, in uncontro­&para;<br>verted testimony, that “ ‘unregulated expenditures—&para;<br>whether soft money donations to the parties or issue ad&para;<br>campaigns—can sometimes generate far more influence&para;<br>than direct campaign contributions.’ ” Ibid. (quoting decla­&para;<br>ration of Wright Andrews; emphasis added). In sum,&para;<br>Judge Kollar-Kotelly found, “[t]he record powerfully dem­&para;<br>onstrates that electioneering communications paid for with&para;<br>the general treasury funds of labor unions and corpora­&para;<br>tions endears those entities to elected officials in a way&para;<br>that could be perceived by the public as corrupting.” Id., at&para;<br>622–623.

Congress and outside experts&para;<br>have generated significant evidence corroborating this&para;<br>rationale, and the only reason we do not have any of the&para;<br>relevant materials before us is that the Government had&para;<br>no reason to develop a record at trial for a facial challenge&para;<br>the plaintiff had abandoned.

The upshot was that after WRTL, a corporate or union expendi­&para;<br>ture could be regulated under §203 only if everyone would understand&para;<br>it as an endorsement of or attack on a particular candidate for office.

A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___ (2009). In&para;<br>that case, Don Blankenship, the chief executive officer of a&para;<br>corporation with a lawsuit pending before the West Vir­&para;<br>ginia high court, spent large sums on behalf of a particular&para;<br>candidate, Brent Benjamin, running for a seat on that&para;<br>court. “In addition to contributing the $1,000 statutory&para;<br>maximum&para;<br>to&para;<br>Benjamin’s&para;<br>campaign&para;<br>committee,&para;<br>Blankenship donated almost $2.5 million to ‘And For The&para;<br>Sake Of The Kids,’ ” a §527 corporation that ran ads tar­&para;<br>geting Benjamin’s opponent.

Applying its common&para;<br>sense, this Court accepted petitioners’ argument that&para;<br>Blankenship’s “pivotal role in getting Justice Benjamin&para;<br>elected created a constitutionally intolerable probability of&para;<br>actual bias” when Benjamin later declined to recuse him­&para;<br>self from the appeal by Blankenship’s corporation. Id., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 11). “Though n[o] . . . bribe or criminal&para;<br>influence” was involved, we recognized that “Justice Ben­&para;<br>jamin would nevertheless feel a debt of gratitude to&para;<br>Blankenship for his extraordinary efforts to get him&para;<br>elected.” Ibid. “The difficulties of inquiring into actual&para;<br>bias,” we further noted, “simply underscore the need for&para;<br>objective rules,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 13)—rules which&para;<br>will perforce turn on the appearance of bias rather than its&para;<br>actual existence.&para;<br>In Caperton, then, we accepted the premise that, at&para;<br>least in some circumstances, independent expenditures on&para;<br>candidate elections will raise an intolerable specter of quid&para;<br>pro quo corruption.

In Amer­&para;<br>ica, incumbent legislators pass the laws that govern cam­&para;<br>paign finance, just like all other laws. To apply a level of&para;<br>scrutiny that effectively bars them from regulating elec­&para;<br>tioneering whenever there is the faintest whiff of self­&para;<br>interest, is to deprive them of the ability to regulate&para;<br>electioneering.&para;<br>This is not to say that deference would be appropriate if&para;<br>there were a solid basis for believing that a legislative&para;<br>action was motivated by the desire to protect incumbents&para;<br>or that it will degrade the competitiveness of the electoral&para;<br>process.68 See League of United Latin American Citizens&para;<br>——————&para;<br>68 JUSTICE&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER has suggested that we strike the balance as fol­&para;<br>&para;<br>72&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v.

Along&para;<br>with our duty to balance competing constitutional con­&para;<br>cerns, we have a vital role to play in ensuring that elec­&para;<br>tions remain at least minimally open, fair, and competi­&para;<br>tive. But it is the height of recklessness to dismiss&para;<br>Congress’ years of bipartisan deliberation and its reasoned&para;<br>judgment on this basis, without first confirming that the&para;<br>statute in question was intended to be, or will function as,&para;<br>a restraint on electoral competition. “Absent record evi­&para;<br>dence of invidious discrimination against challengers as a&para;<br>class, a court should generally be hesitant to invalidate&para;<br>legislation which on its face imposes evenhanded restric­&para;<br>tions.” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 31.&para;<br>We have no record evidence from which to conclude that&para;<br>BCRA §203, or any of the dozens of state laws that the&para;<br>Court today calls into question, reflects or fosters such&para;<br>invidious discrimination. Our colleagues have opined that&para;<br>“ ‘any restriction upon a type of campaign speech that is&para;<br>equally available to challengers and incumbents tends to&para;<br>favor incumbents.’ ” McConnell, 540 U. S., at 249 (opinion&para;<br>of SCALIA, J.). This kind of airy speculation could easily be&para;<br>turned on its head. The electioneering prohibited by §203&para;<br>might well tend to favor incumbents, because incumbents&para;<br>have pre-existing relationships with corporations and&para;<br>unions, and groups that wish to procure legislative bene­&para;<br>fits may tend to support the candidate who, as a sitting&para;<br>officeholder, is already in a position to dispense benefits&para;<br>and is statistically likely to retain office. If a corporation’s&para;<br>goal is to induce officeholders to do its bidding, the corpo­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>lows: “We should defer to [the legislature’s] political judgment that&para;<br>unlimited spending threatens the integrity of the electoral process.

Nor do we&para;<br>have a good empirical case for skepticism, as the Court’s&para;<br>failure to cite any empirical research attests. Nor does the&para;<br>legislative history give reason for concern.

Understood prop­&para;<br>erly, “antidistortion” is simply a variant on the classic&para;<br>governmental interest in protecting against improper&para;<br>influences on officeholders that debilitate the democratic&para;<br>process. It is manifestly not just an “ ‘equalizing’ ” ideal in&para;<br>disguise. Ante, at 34 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.

But the fact that Austin&para;<br>can be read a certain way hardly proves THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s charge&para;<br>that there is nothing more to it. Many of our precedents can bear&para;<br>multiple readings, and many of our doctrines have some “equalizing”&para;<br>implications but do not rest on an equalizing theory: for example, our&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

Antidistortion&para;<br>The fact that corporations are different from human&para;<br>beings might seem to need no elaboration, except that the&para;<br>majority opinion almost completely elides it. Austin set&para;<br>forth some of the basic differences. Unlike natural per­&para;<br>sons, corporations have “limited liability” for their owners&para;<br>and managers, “perpetual life,” separation of ownership&para;<br>and control, “and favorable treatment of the accumulation&para;<br>and distribution of assets . . . that enhance their ability to&para;<br>attract capital and to deploy their resources in ways that&para;<br>maximize the return on their shareholders’ investments.”&para;<br>494 U. S., at 658–659. Unlike voters in U. S. elections,&para;<br>corporations may be foreign controlled.70 Unlike other&para;<br>interest groups, business corporations have been “effec­&para;<br>tively delegated responsibility for ensuring society’s eco­&para;<br>nomic welfare”;71 they inescapably structure the life of&para;<br>every citizen. “ ‘[T]he resources in the treasury of a busi­&para;<br>ness corporation,’ ” furthermore, “ ‘are not an indication of&para;<br>popular support for the corporation’s political ideas.’ ” Id.,&para;<br>at 659 (quoting MCFL, 479 U.

The availability of these resources may&para;<br>——————&para;<br>takings jurisprudence and numerous rules of criminal procedure. More&para;<br>important, the Austin Court expressly declined to rely on a speech­&para;<br>equalization rationale, see 494 U. S., at 660, and we have never under­&para;<br>stood Austin to stand for such a rationale. Whatever his personal&para;<br>views, Justice Marshall simply did not write the opinion that THE&para;<br>CHIEF JUSTICE suggests he did; indeed, he “would have viewed it as&para;<br>irresponsible to write an opinion that boldly staked out a rationale&para;<br>based on equality that no one other than perhaps Justice White would&para;<br>have even considered joining,” Garrett, 52 Howard L.

Presumably it&para;<br>is not the customers or employees, who typically have no&para;<br>say in such matters. It cannot realistically be said to be&para;<br>the shareholders, who tend to be far removed from the&para;<br>day-to-day decisions of the firm and whose political prefer­&para;<br>ences may be opaque to management. Perhaps the officers&para;<br>or directors of the corporation have the best claim to be&para;<br>the ones speaking, except their fiduciary duties generally&para;<br>prohibit them from using corporate funds for personal&para;<br>ends. Some individuals associated with the corporation&para;<br>must make the decision to place the ad, but the idea that&para;<br>these individuals are thereby fostering their self­&para;<br>expression or cultivating their critical faculties is fanciful.&para;<br>It is entirely possible that the corporation’s electoral mes­&para;<br>sage will conflict with their personal convictions. Take&para;<br>away the ability to use general treasury funds for some of&para;<br>those ads, and no one’s autonomy, dignity, or political&para;<br>equality has been impinged upon in the least.&para;<br>Corporate expenditures are distinguishable from indi­&para;<br>vidual expenditures in this respect. I have taken the view&para;<br>that a legislature may place reasonable restrictions on&para;<br>individuals’ electioneering expenditures in the service of&para;<br>&para;<br>78&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v.

See, e.g.,&para;<br>Randall, 548 U. S., at 273 (dissenting opinion). But those&para;<br>restrictions concededly present a tougher case, because the&para;<br>primary conduct of actual, flesh-and-blood persons is&para;<br>involved. Some of those individuals might feel that they&para;<br>need to spend large sums of money on behalf of a particu­&para;<br>lar candidate to vindicate the intensity of their electoral&para;<br>preferences. This is obviously not the situation with busi­&para;<br>ness corporations, as their routine practice of giving “sub­&para;<br>stantial sums to both major national parties” makes pellu­&para;<br>cidly clear.

See id.,&para;<br>at 10–19. A system that effectively forces corporations to&para;<br>use their shareholders’ money both to maintain access to,&para;<br>and to avoid retribution from, elected officials may ulti­&para;<br>mately prove more harmful than beneficial to many corpo­&para;<br>rations.

The Court’s central argument is that&para;<br>laws such as §203 have “ ‘deprived [the electorate] of in­&para;<br>formation, knowledge and opinion vital to its function,’ ”&para;<br>ante, at 38 (quoting CIO, 335 U. S., at 144 (Rutledge, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment)), and this, in turn, “interferes&para;<br>with the ‘open marketplace’ of ideas protected by the First&para;<br>Amendment,” ante, at 38 (quoting New York State Bd. of&para;<br>Elections v. Lopez Torres, 552 U. S. 196, 208 (2008)).&para;<br>There are many flaws in this argument. If the overrid­&para;<br>ing concern depends on the interests of the audience,&para;<br>surely the public’s perception of the value of corporate&para;<br>speech should be given important weight. That perception&para;<br>today is the same as it was a century ago when Theodore&para;<br>Roosevelt delivered the speeches to Congress that, in time,&para;<br>led to the limited prohibition on corporate campaign ex­&para;<br>penditures that is overruled today. See WRTL, 551 U. S.,&para;<br>at 509–510 (Souter, J., dissenting) (summarizing President&para;<br>——————&para;<br>owners may speak in their own names, rather than the business’, if&para;<br>they wish to evade §203 altogether. Nonprofit corporations that want&para;<br>to make unrestricted electioneering expenditures may do so if they&para;<br>refuse donations from businesses and unions and permit members to&para;<br>disassociate without economic penalty. See MCFL, 479 U. S. 238, 264&para;<br>(1986). Making it plain that their decision is not motivated by a con­&para;<br>cern about BCRA’s coverage of nonprofits that have ideological mis­&para;<br>sions but lack MCFL status, our colleagues refuse to apply the SnoweJeffords Amendment or the lower courts’ de minimis exception to&para;<br>MCFL.

The distinctive threat to democratic&para;<br>integrity posed by corporate domination of politics was&para;<br>recognized at “the inception of the republic” and “has been&para;<br>a persistent theme in American political life” ever since.&para;<br>Regan 302. It is only certain Members of this Court, not&para;<br>the listeners themselves, who have agitated for more cor­&para;<br>porate electioneering.&para;<br>Austin recognized that there are substantial reasons&para;<br>why a legislature might conclude that unregulated general&para;<br>treasury expenditures will give corporations “unfai[r]&para;<br>influence” in the electoral process, 494 U. S., at 660, and&para;<br>distort public debate in ways that undermine rather than&para;<br>advance the interests of listeners. The legal structure of&para;<br>corporations allows them to amass and deploy financial&para;<br>resources on a scale few natural persons can match. The&para;<br>structure of a business corporation, furthermore, draws a&para;<br>line between the corporation’s economic interests and the&para;<br>political preferences of the individuals associated with the&para;<br>corporation; the corporation must engage the electoral&para;<br>process with the aim “to enhance the profitability of the&para;<br>company, no matter how persuasive the arguments for a&para;<br>broader or conflicting set of priorities,” Brief for American&para;<br>Independent Business Alliance as Amicus Curiae 11; see&para;<br>also ALI, Principles of Corporate Governance: Analysis&para;<br>and Recommendations §2.01(a), p. 55 (1992) (“[A] corpora­&para;<br>tion . . . should have as its objective the conduct of busi­&para;<br>ness activities with a view to enhancing corporate profit&para;<br>and shareholder gain”). In a state election such as the one&para;<br>at issue in Austin, the interests of nonresident corpora­&para;<br>tions may be fundamentally adverse to the interests of&para;<br>local voters. Consequently, when corporations grab up the&para;<br>prime broadcasting slots on the eve of an election, they can&para;<br>flood the market with advocacy that bears “little or no&para;<br>correlation” to the ideas of natural persons or to any&para;<br>broader notion of the public good, 494 U. S., at 660. The&para;<br>opinions of real people may be marginalized. “The expen­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

S., at 259.&para;<br>In addition to this immediate drowning out of noncorpo­&para;<br>rate voices, there may be deleterious effects that follow&para;<br>soon thereafter. Corporate “domination” of electioneering,&para;<br>Austin, 494 U. S., at 659, can generate the impression that&para;<br>corporations dominate our democracy. When citizens turn&para;<br>on their televisions and radios before an election and hear&para;<br>only corporate electioneering, they may lose faith in their&para;<br>capacity, as citizens, to influence public policy. A Gov­&para;<br>ernment captured by corporate interests, they may come&para;<br>to believe, will be neither responsive to their needs nor&para;<br>willing to give their views a fair hearing. The predictable&para;<br>result is cynicism and disenchantment: an increased&para;<br>perception that large spenders “ ‘call the tune’ ” and a&para;<br>reduced “ ‘willingness of voters to take part in democratic&para;<br>governance.’ ” McConnell, 540 U. S., at 144 (quoting&para;<br>Shrink Missouri, 528 U. S., at 390). To the extent that&para;<br>corporations are allowed to exert undue influence in elec­&para;<br>toral races, the speech of the eventual winners of those&para;<br>races may also be chilled. Politicians who fear that a&para;<br>certain corporation can make or break their reelection&para;<br>chances may be cowed into silence about that corporation.&para;<br>On a variety of levels, unregulated corporate electioneer­&para;<br>ing might diminish the ability of citizens to “hold officials&para;<br>accountable to the people,” ante, at 23, and disserve the&para;<br>goal of a public debate that is “uninhibited, robust, and&para;<br>wide-open,” New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S.&para;<br>254, 270 (1964). At the least, I stress again, a legislature&para;<br>is entitled to credit these concerns and to take tailored&para;<br>measures in response.&para;<br>The majority’s unwillingness to distinguish between&para;<br>corporations and humans similarly blinds it to the possi­&para;<br>bility that corporations’ “war chests” and their special&para;<br>&para;<br>82&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>“advantages” in the legal realm, Austin, 494 U. S., at 659,&para;<br>may translate into special advantages in the market for&para;<br>legislation. When large numbers of citizens have a com­&para;<br>mon stake in a measure that is under consideration, it&para;<br>may be very difficult for them to coordinate resources on&para;<br>behalf of their position. The corporate form, by contrast,&para;<br>“provides a simple way to channel rents to only those who&para;<br>have paid their dues, as it were. If you do not own stock,&para;<br>you do not benefit from the larger dividends or apprecia­&para;<br>tion in the stock price caused by the passage of private&para;<br>interest legislation.” Sitkoff, Corporate Political Speech,&para;<br>Political Extortion, and the Competition for Corporate&para;<br>Charters, 69 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1103, 1113 (2002). Corpora­&para;<br>tions, that is, are uniquely equipped to seek laws that&para;<br>favor their owners, not simply because they have a lot of&para;<br>money but because of their legal and organizational struc­&para;<br>ture. Remove all restrictions on their electioneering, and&para;<br>the door may be opened to a type of rent seeking that is&para;<br>“far more destructive” than what noncorporations are&para;<br>capable of. Ibid. It is for reasons such as these that our&para;<br>campaign finance jurisprudence has long appreciated that&para;<br>“the ‘differing structures and purposes’ of different entities&para;<br>‘may require different forms of regulation in order to&para;<br>protect the integrity of the electoral process.’ ” NRWC, 459&para;<br>U. S., at 210 (quoting California Medical Assn., 453 U. S.,&para;<br>at 201).&para;<br>The Court’s facile depiction of corporate electioneering&para;<br>assumes away all of these complexities. Our colleagues&para;<br>ridicule the idea of regulating expenditures based on&para;<br>“nothing more” than a fear that corporations have a spe­&para;<br>cial “ability to persuade,” ante, at 11 (opinion of ROBERTS,&para;<br>C. J.), as if corporations were our society’s ablest debaters&para;<br>and viewpoint-neutral laws such as §203 were created to&para;<br>suppress their best arguments. In their haste to knock&para;<br>down yet another straw man, our colleagues simply ignore&para;<br>the fundamental concerns of the Austin Court and the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

All of the majority’s theoreti­&para;<br>cal arguments turn on a proposition with undeniable&para;<br>surface appeal but little grounding in evidence or experi­&para;<br>ence, “that there is no such thing as too much speech,”&para;<br>Austin, 494 U. S., at 695 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)).74 If&para;<br>individuals in our society had infinite free time to listen to&para;<br>and contemplate every last bit of speech uttered by any­&para;<br>one, anywhere; and if broadcast advertisements had no&para;<br>special ability to influence elections apart from the merits&para;<br>of their arguments (to the extent they make any); and if&para;<br>legislators always operated with nothing less than perfect&para;<br>virtue; then I suppose the majority’s premise would be&para;<br>sound. In the real world, we have seen, corporate domina­&para;<br>tion of the airwaves prior to an election may decrease the&para;<br>average listener’s exposure to relevant viewpoints, and it&para;<br>may diminish citizens’ willingness and capacity to partici­&para;<br>pate in the democratic process.&para;<br>None of this is to suggest that corporations can or&para;<br>should be denied an opportunity to participate in election&para;<br>campaigns or in any other public forum (much less that a&para;<br>work of art such as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington may be&para;<br>banned), or to deny that some corporate speech may con­&para;<br>tribute significantly to public debate. What it shows,&para;<br>however, is that Austin’s “concern about corporate domi­&para;<br>nation of the political process,” 494 U. S., at 659, reflects&para;<br>more than a concern to protect governmental interests&para;<br>outside of the First Amendment. It also reflects a concern&para;<br>to facilitate First Amendment values by preserving some&para;<br>breathing room around the electoral “marketplace” of&para;<br>ideas, ante, at 19, 34, 38, 52, 54, the marketplace in which&para;<br>the actual people of this Nation determine how they will&para;<br>——————&para;<br>74 Of course, no presiding person in a courtroom, legislature, class­&para;<br>room, polling place, or family dinner would take this hyperbole literally.&para;<br>&para;<br>84&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v.

The majority seems oblivious to the&para;<br>simple truth that laws such as §203 do not merely pit the&para;<br>anticorruption interest against the First Amendment, but&para;<br>also pit competing First Amendment values against each&para;<br>other. There are, to be sure, serious concerns with any&para;<br>effort to balance the First Amendment rights of speakers&para;<br>against the First Amendment rights of listeners. But&para;<br>when the speakers in question are not real people and&para;<br>when the appeal to “First Amendment principles” depends&para;<br>almost entirely on the listeners’ perspective, ante, at 1, 48,&para;<br>it becomes necessary to consider how listeners will actu­&para;<br>ally be affected.&para;<br>In critiquing Austin’s antidistortion rationale and cam­&para;<br>paign finance regulation more generally, our colleagues&para;<br>place tremendous weight on the example of media corpora­&para;<br>tions. See ante, at 35–38, 46; ante, at 1, 11 (opinion of&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J.); ante, at 6 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Yet it is&para;<br>not at all clear that Austin would permit §203 to be ap­&para;<br>plied to them. The press plays a unique role not only in&para;<br>the text, history, and structure of the First Amendment&para;<br>but also in facilitating public discourse; as the Austin&para;<br>Court explained, “media corporations differ significantly&para;<br>from other corporations in that their resources are devoted&para;<br>to the collection of information and its dissemination to&para;<br>the public,” 494 U.

Our colleagues have raised&para;<br>some interesting and difficult questions about Congress’&para;<br>authority to regulate electioneering by the press, and&para;<br>about how to define what constitutes the press. But that&para;<br>is not the case before us. Section 203 does not apply to&para;<br>media corporations, and even if it did, Citizens United is&para;<br>not a media corporation.

Ante, at 23. In light of&para;<br>the distinctive features of corporations identified in Aus&para;<br>tin, there is no valid basis for this assumption. The mar­&para;<br>ketplace of ideas is not actually a place where items—or&para;<br>laws—are meant to be bought and sold, and when we&para;<br>move from the realm of economics to the realm of corpo­&para;<br>rate electioneering, there may be no “reason to think the&para;<br>market ordering is intrinsically good at all,” Strauss 1386.&para;<br>The Court’s blinkered and aphoristic approach to the&para;<br>First Amendment may well promote corporate power at&para;<br>the cost of the individual and collective self-expression the&para;<br>Amendment was meant to serve.

S., at 660–661. When&para;<br>corporations use general treasury funds to praise or attack a&para;<br>particular candidate for office, it is the shareholders, as the&para;<br>residual claimants, who are effectively footing the bill.&para;<br>Those shareholders who disagree with the corporation’s&para;<br>electoral message may find their financial investments&para;<br>being used to undermine their political convictions.&para;<br>The PAC mechanism, by contrast, helps assure that&para;<br>those who pay for an electioneering communication actu­&para;<br>ally support its content and that managers do not use&para;<br>general treasuries to advance personal agendas. Ibid. It&para;<br>“ ‘allows corporate political participation without the temp­&para;<br>tation to use corporate funds for political influence, quite&para;<br>possibly at odds with the sentiments of some shareholders&para;<br>or members.’ ” McConnell, 540 U.

A rule that privileges the&para;<br>use of PACs thus does more than facilitate the political&para;<br>speech of like-minded shareholders; it also curbs the rent&para;<br>seeking behavior of executives and respects the views of&para;<br>dissenters. Austin’s acceptance of restrictions on general&para;<br>treasury spending “simply allows people who have in­&para;<br>vested in the business corporation for purely economic&para;<br>reasons”—the vast majority of investors, one assumes—“to&para;<br>avoid being taken advantage of, without sacrificing their&para;<br>economic objectives.” Winkler, Beyond Bellotti, 32 Loyola&para;<br>(LA) L.

Moreover, if the corpo­&para;<br>ration in question operates a PAC, an investor who sees&para;<br>the company’s ads may not know whether they are being&para;<br>funded through the PAC or through the general treasury.&para;<br>If and when shareholders learn that a corporation has&para;<br>been spending general treasury money on objectionable&para;<br>electioneering, they can divest. Even assuming that they&para;<br>reliably learn as much, however, this solution is only&para;<br>partial.

The shareholder protection&para;<br>rationale has been criticized as underinclusive, in that&para;<br>corporations also spend money on lobbying and charitable&para;<br>contributions in ways that any particular shareholder&para;<br>might disapprove.

Rather, the Court applied it to reinforce the&para;<br>antidistortion rationale, in two main ways. First, the&para;<br>problem of dissenting shareholders shows that even if&para;<br>electioneering expenditures can advance the political&para;<br>views of some members of a corporation, they will often&para;<br>compromise the views of others. See, e.g., id., at 663 (dis­&para;<br>cussing risk that corporation’s “members may be . . . reluc­&para;<br>tant to withdraw as members even if they disagree with&para;<br>[its] political expression”). Second, it provides an addi­&para;<br>tional reason, beyond the distinctive legal attributes of the&para;<br>corporate form, for doubting that these “expenditures&para;<br>reflect actual public support for the political ideas es­&para;<br>poused,” id., at 660. The shareholder protection rationale,&para;<br>in other words, bolsters the conclusion that restrictions on&para;<br>corporate electioneering can serve both speakers’ and&para;<br>listeners’ interests, as well as the anticorruption interest.&para;<br>And it supplies yet another reason why corporate expendi­&para;<br>tures merit less protection than individual expenditures.&para;<br>V&para;<br>Today’s decision is backwards in many senses. It ele­&para;<br>vates the majority’s agenda over the litigants’ submis­&para;<br>sions, facial attacks over as-applied claims, broad constitu­&para;<br>tional theories over narrow statutory grounds, individual&para;<br>dissenting opinions over precedential holdings, assertion&para;<br>over tradition, absolutism over empiricism, rhetoric over&para;<br>reality. Our colleagues have arrived at the conclusion that&para;<br>Austin must be overruled and that §203 is facially uncon­&para;<br>stitutional only after mischaracterizing both the reach and&para;<br>&para;<br>90&para;<br>&para;<br>CITIZENS UNITED v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM’N&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>rationale of those authorities, and after bypassing or&para;<br>ignoring rules of judicial restraint used to cabin the&para;<br>Court’s lawmaking power. Their conclusion that the&para;<br>societal interest in avoiding corruption and the appear­&para;<br>ance of corruption does not provide an adequate justifica­&para;<br>tion for regulating corporate expenditures on candidate&para;<br>elections relies on an incorrect description of that interest,&para;<br>along with a failure to acknowledge the relevance of estab­&para;<br>lished facts and the considered judgments of state and&para;<br>federal legislatures over many decades.&para;<br>In a democratic society, the longstanding consensus on&para;<br>the need to limit corporate campaign spending should&para;<br>outweigh the wooden application of judge-made rules. The&para;<br>majority’s rejection of this principle “elevate[s] corpora­&para;<br>tions to a level of deference which has not been seen at&para;<br>least since the days when substantive due process was&para;<br>regularly used to invalidate regulatory legislation thought&para;<br>to unfairly impinge upon established economic interests.”&para;<br>Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 817, n. 13 (White, J., dissenting). At&para;<br>bottom, the Court’s opinion is thus a rejection of the com­&para;<br>mon sense of the American people, who have recognized a&para;<br>need to prevent corporations from undermining self­&para;<br>government since the founding, and who have fought&para;<br>against the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate&para;<br>electioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. It is a&para;<br>strange time to repudiate that common sense.

Rather, it is to demon­&para;<br>strate—using real-world, recent examples—the fallacy in&para;<br>the Court’s conclusion that “[d]isclaimer and disclosure&para;<br>requirements . . . impose no ceiling on campaign-related&para;<br>activities, and do not prevent anyone from speaking.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

Disclaimer and disclosure re­&para;<br>quirements enable private citizens and elected officials to&para;<br>implement political strategies specifically calculated to&para;<br>curtail campaign-related activity and prevent the lawful,&para;<br>peaceful exercise of First Amendment rights.&para;<br>The Court nevertheless insists that as-applied chal­&para;<br>lenges to disclosure requirements will suffice to vindicate&para;<br>those speech rights, as long as potential plaintiffs can&para;<br>“show a reasonable probability that disclosure . . . will&para;<br>subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from&para;<br>either Government officials or private parties.” Ante, at 52&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). But the Court’s opin­&para;<br>ion itself proves the irony in this compromise. In correctly&para;<br>explaining why it must address the facial constitutionality&para;<br>of §203, see ante, at 5–20, the Court recognizes that “[t]he&para;<br>First Amendment does not permit laws that force speakers&para;<br>to . . . seek declaratory rulings before discussing the most&para;<br>salient political issues of our day,” ante, at 7; that as­&para;<br>applied challenges to §203 “would require substantial&para;<br>litigation over an extended time” and result in an “inter­&para;<br>pretive process [that] itself would create an inevitable,&para;<br>pervasive, and serious risk of chilling protected speech&para;<br>pending the drawing of fine distinctions that, in the end,&para;<br>would themselves be questionable,” ante, at 9–10; that “a&para;<br>court would be remiss in performing its duties were it to&para;<br>accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the necessity&para;<br>of making a broader ruling,” ante, at 12; and that avoiding&para;<br>a facial challenge to §203 “would prolong the substantial,&para;<br>nation-wide chilling effect” that §203 causes, ante, at 16.&para;<br>This logic, of course, applies equally to as-applied chal­&para;<br>lenges to §§201 and 311.&para;<br>Irony aside, the Court’s promise that as-applied chal­&para;<br>lenges will adequately protect speech is a hollow assur­&para;<br>ance.
