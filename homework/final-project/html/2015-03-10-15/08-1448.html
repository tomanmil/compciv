Argued November 2, 2010—Decided June 27, 2011&para;<br>Respondents, representing the video-game and software industries,&para;<br>filed a preenforcement challenge to a California law that restricts the&para;<br>sale or rental of violent video games to minors. The Federal District&para;<br>Court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and&para;<br>permanently enjoined its enforcement. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: The Act does not comport with the First Amendment. Pp. 2–18.&para;<br>(a) Video games qualify for First Amendment protection. Like pro&para;<br>tected books, plays, and movies, they communicate ideas through fa&para;<br>miliar literary devices and features distinctive to the medium. And&para;<br>“the basic principles of freedom of speech . . . do not vary” with a new&para;<br>and different communication medium. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wil&para;<br>son, 343 U. S. 495, 503. The most basic principle—that government&para;<br>lacks the power to restrict expression because of its message, ideas,&para;<br>subject matter, or content, Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Un&para;<br>ion, 535 U. S. 564, 573—is subject to a few limited exceptions for his&para;<br>torically unprotected speech, such as obscenity, incitement, and fight&para;<br>ing words. But a legislature cannot create new categories of&para;<br>unprotected speech simply by weighing the value of a particular&para;<br>category against its social costs and then punishing it if it fails the&para;<br>test. See United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___. Unlike the&para;<br>New York law upheld in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, Cali&para;<br>fornia’s Act does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of&para;<br>unprotected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is&para;<br>not uncritically applied to children. Instead, the State wishes to cre&para;<br>ate a wholly new category of content-based regulation that is permis&para;<br>sible only for speech directed at children. That is unprecedented and&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>mistaken. This country has no tradition of specially restricting chil&para;<br>dren’s access to depictions of violence. And California’s claim that&para;<br>“interactive” video games present special problems, in that the player&para;<br>participates in the violent action on screen and determines its out&para;<br>come, is unpersuasive. Pp. 2–11.&para;<br>(b) Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of pro&para;<br>tected speech, it is invalid unless California can demonstrate that it&para;<br>passes strict scrutiny, i.e., it is justified by a compelling government&para;<br>interest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest. R. A. V. v. St.&para;<br>Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 395. California cannot meet that standard. Psy&para;<br>chological studies purporting to show a connection between exposure&para;<br>to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove&para;<br>that such exposure causes minors to act aggressively. Any demon&para;<br>strated effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects pro&para;<br>duced by other media. Since California has declined to restrict those&para;<br>other media, e.g., Saturday morning cartoons, its video-game regula&para;<br>tion is wildly underinclusive, raising serious doubts about whether&para;<br>the State is pursuing the interest it invokes or is instead disfavoring&para;<br>a particular speaker or viewpoint. California also cannot show that&para;<br>the Act’s restrictions meet the alleged substantial need of parents&para;<br>who wish to restrict their children’s access to violent videos. The&para;<br>video-game industry’s voluntary rating system already accomplishes&para;<br>that to a large extent. Moreover, as a means of assisting parents the&para;<br>Act is greatly overinclusive, since not all of the children who are pro&para;<br>hibited from purchasing violent video games have parents who dis&para;<br>approve of their doing so. The Act cannot satisfy strict scrutiny.&para;<br>Pp. 11–18.&para;<br>&para;<br>556 F. 3d 950, affirmed.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which KENNEDY,&para;<br>GINSBURG, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., joined.

Violation of the Act is pun&para;<br>ishable by a civil fine of up to $1,000. §1746.3.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondents, representing the video-game and software&para;<br>industries, brought a preenforcement challenge to the Act&para;<br>in the United States District Court for the Northern Dis&para;<br>trict of California. That court concluded that the Act&para;<br>violated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined&para;<br>its enforcement. Video Software Dealers Assn. v. Schwar&para;<br>zenegger, No. C–05–04188 RMW (2007), App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 39a. The Court of Appeals affirmed, Video Software&para;<br>Dealers Assn. v. Schwarzenegger, 556 F. 3d 950 (CA9&para;<br>2009), and we granted certiorari, 559 U. S. ____ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>California correctly acknowledges that video games&para;<br>qualify for First Amendment protection. The Free Speech&para;<br>Clause exists principally to protect discourse on public&para;<br>matters, but we have long recognized that it is difficult to&para;<br>distinguish politics from entertainment, and dangerous to&para;<br>try. “Everyone is familiar with instances of propaganda&para;<br>through fiction. What is one man’s amusement, teaches&para;<br>another’s doctrine.” Winters v. New York, 333 U. S. 507,&para;<br>510 (1948). Like the protected books, plays, and movies&para;<br>that preceded them, video games communicate ideas—and&para;<br>even social messages—through many familiar literary&para;<br>devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and&para;<br>through features distinctive to the medium (such as the&para;<br>player’s interaction with the virtual world). That suffices&para;<br>to confer First Amendment protection. Under our Consti&para;<br>tution, “esthetic and moral judgments about art and lit&para;<br>erature . . . are for the individual to make, not for the&para;<br>Government to decree, even with the mandate or approval&para;<br>of a majority.” United States v. Playboy Entertainment&para;<br>Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 818 (2000). And whatever the&para;<br>challenges of applying the Constitution to ever-advancing&para;<br>technology, “the basic principles of freedom of speech and&para;<br>the press, like the First Amendment’s command, do not&para;<br>vary” when a new and different medium for communica&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tion appears. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U. S.&para;<br>495, 503 (1952).&para;<br>The most basic of those principles is this: “[A]s a general&para;<br>matter, . . . government has no power to restrict expres&para;<br>sion because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or&para;<br>its content.” Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union,&para;<br>535 U. S. 564, 573 (2002) (internal quotation marks omit&para;<br>ted). There are of course exceptions. “ ‘From 1791 to the&para;<br>present,’ . . . the First Amendment has ‘permitted restric&para;<br>tions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,’&para;<br>and has never ‘include[d] a freedom to disregard these&para;<br>traditional limitations.’ ” United States v. Stevens, 559&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (quoting R. A. V. v. St.&para;<br>Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 382–383 (1992)). These limited ar&para;<br>eas—such as obscenity, Roth v. United States, 354 U. S.&para;<br>476, 483 (1957), incitement, Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395&para;<br>U. S. 444, 447–449 (1969) (per curiam), and fighting&para;<br>words, Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568,&para;<br>572 (1942)—represent “well-defined and narrowly limited&para;<br>classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which&para;<br>have never been thought to raise any Constitutional prob&para;<br>lem,” id., at 571–572.&para;<br>Last Term, in Stevens, we held that new categories of&para;<br>unprotected speech may not be added to the list by a&para;<br>legislature that concludes certain speech is too harmful to&para;<br>be tolerated. Stevens concerned a federal statute purport&para;<br>ing to criminalize the creation, sale, or possession of cer&para;<br>tain depictions of animal cruelty. See 18 U. S. C. §48&para;<br>(amended 2010). The statute covered depictions “in which&para;<br>a living animal is intentionally maimed, mutilated, tor&para;<br>tured, wounded, or killed” if that harm to the animal was&para;<br>illegal where the “the creation, sale, or possession t[ook]&para;<br>place,” §48(c)(1). A saving clause largely borrowed from&para;<br>our obscenity jurisprudence, see Miller v. California, 413&para;<br>U. S. 15, 24 (1973), exempted depictions with “serious&para;<br>religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic,&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>historical, or artistic value,” §48(b). We held that statute&para;<br>to be an impermissible content-based restriction on&para;<br>speech. There was no American tradition of forbidding the&para;<br>depiction of animal cruelty—though States have long had&para;<br>laws against committing it.&para;<br>The Government argued in Stevens that lack of a his&para;<br>torical warrant did not matter; that it could create new&para;<br>categories of unprotected speech by applying a “simple&para;<br>balancing test” that weighs the value of a particular cate&para;<br>gory of speech against its social costs and then punishes&para;<br>that category of speech if it fails the test. Stevens, 559&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). We emphatically rejected that&para;<br>“startling and dangerous” proposition. Ibid. “Maybe there&para;<br>are some categories of speech that have been historically&para;<br>unprotected, but have not yet been specifically identified&para;<br>or discussed as such in our case law.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 9). But without persuasive evidence that a novel re&para;<br>striction on content is part of a long (if heretofore unrec&para;<br>ognized) tradition of proscription, a legislature may not&para;<br>revise the “judgment [of] the American people,” embodied&para;<br>in the First Amendment, “that the benefits of its restric&para;<br>tions on the Government outweigh the costs.” Id., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 7).&para;<br>That holding controls this case.1 As in Stevens, Califor&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 JUSTICE ALITO distinguishes Stevens on several grounds that seem to&para;<br>us ill founded. He suggests, post, at 10 (opinion concurring in judg&para;<br>ment), that Stevens did not apply strict scrutiny. If that is so (and we&para;<br>doubt it), it would make this an a fortiori case. He says, post, at 9, 10,&para;<br>that the California Act punishes the sale or rental rather than the&para;<br>“creation” or “possession” of violent depictions. That distinction ap&para;<br>pears nowhere in Stevens itself, and for good reason: It would make&para;<br>permissible the prohibition of printing or selling books—though not the&para;<br>writing of them. Whether government regulation applies to creating,&para;<br>distributing, or consuming speech makes no difference. And finally,&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO points out, post, at 10, that Stevens “left open the possi&para;<br>bility that a more narrowly drawn statute” would be constitutional.&para;<br>True, but entirely irrelevant. Stevens said, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>nia has tried to make violent-speech regulation look like&para;<br>obscenity regulation by appending a saving clause re&para;<br>quired for the latter. That does not suffice. Our cases&para;<br>have been clear that the obscenity exception to the First&para;<br>Amendment does not cover whatever a legislature finds&para;<br>shocking, but only depictions of “sexual conduct,” Miller,&para;<br>supra, at 24. See also Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15,&para;<br>20 (1971); Roth, supra, at 487, and n. 20.&para;<br>Stevens was not the first time we have encountered and&para;<br>rejected a State’s attempt to shoehorn speech about vio&para;<br>lence into obscenity. In Winters, we considered a New&para;<br>York criminal statute “forbid[ding] the massing of stories&para;<br>of bloodshed and lust in such a way as to incite to crime&para;<br>against the person,” 333 U. S., at 514. The New York&para;<br>Court of Appeals upheld the provision as a law against&para;<br>obscenity. “[T]here can be no more precise test of written&para;<br>indecency or obscenity,” it said, “than the continuing and&para;<br>changeable experience of the community as to what types&para;<br>of books are likely to bring about the corruption of public&para;<br>morals or other analogous injury to the public order. ” Id.,&para;<br>at 514 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is of&para;<br>course the same expansive view of governmental power to&para;<br>abridge the freedom of speech based on interest-balancing&para;<br>that we rejected in Stevens. Our opinion in Winters, which&para;<br>concluded that the New York statute failed a heightened&para;<br>vagueness standard applicable to restrictions upon speech&para;<br>entitled to First Amendment protection, 333 U. S., at 517–&para;<br>519, made clear that violence is not part of the obscenity&para;<br>that the Constitution permits to be regulated. The speech&para;<br>reached by the statute contained “no indecency or obscen&para;<br>ity in any sense heretofore known to the law.” Id., at 519.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>19), that the “crush-video” statute at issue there might pass muster if it&para;<br>were limited to videos of acts of animal cruelty that violated the law&para;<br>where the acts were performed. There is no contention that any of the&para;<br>virtual characters depicted in the imaginative videos at issue here are&para;<br>criminally liable.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Because speech about violence is not obscene, it is of no&para;<br>consequence that California’s statute mimics the New&para;<br>York statute regulating obscenity-for-minors that we&para;<br>upheld in Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629 (1968).&para;<br>That case approved a prohibition on the sale to minors of&para;<br>sexual material that would be obscene from the perspec&para;<br>tive of a child.2 We held that the legislature could&para;<br>“adjus[t] the definition of obscenity ‘to social realities by&para;<br>permitting the appeal of this type of material to be as&para;<br>sessed in terms of the sexual interests . . .’ of . . . minors. ”&para;<br>Id., at 638 (quoting Mishkin v. New York, 383 U. S. 502,&para;<br>509 (1966)). And because “obscenity is not protected&para;<br>expression,” the New York statute could be sustained so&para;<br>long as the legislature’s judgment that the proscribed&para;<br>materials were harmful to children “was not irrational.”&para;<br>390 U. S., at 641.&para;<br>The California Act is something else entirely. It does&para;<br>not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unpro&para;<br>tected speech to ensure that a definition designed for&para;<br>adults is not uncritically applied to children. California&para;<br>does not argue that it is empowered to prohibit selling&para;<br>offensively violent works to adults—and it is wise not to,&para;<br>since that is but a hair’s breadth from the argument re&para;<br>jected in Stevens. Instead, it wishes to create a wholly&para;<br>new category of content-based regulation that is permissi&para;<br>ble only for speech directed at children.&para;<br>That is unprecedented and mistaken. “[M]inors are&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The statute in Ginsberg restricted the sale of certain depictions of&para;<br>“nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sado-masochistic abuse,”&para;<br>that were “‘[h]armful to minors.’ ” A depiction was harmful to minors if it:&para;<br>“(i) predominantly appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid&para;<br>interests of minors, and&para;<br>“(ii) is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult commu&para;<br>nity as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors, and&para;<br>“(iii) is utterly without redeeming social importance for minors.” 390&para;<br>U.

Jackson&para;<br>ville, 422 U. S. 205, 212–213 (1975) (citation omitted). No&para;<br>doubt a State possesses legitimate power to protect chil&para;<br>dren from harm, Ginsberg, supra, at 640–641; Prince v.&para;<br>Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, 165 (1944), but that does&para;<br>not include a free-floating power to restrict the ideas to&para;<br>which children may be exposed. “Speech that is neither&para;<br>obscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate&para;<br>proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the&para;<br>young from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks&para;<br>unsuitable for them.” Erznoznik, supra, at 213–214.3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 JUSTICE&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS ignores the holding of Erznoznik, and denies that&para;<br>persons under 18 have any constitutional right to speak or be spoken to&para;<br>without their parents’ consent. He cites no case, state or federal,&para;<br>supporting this view, and to our knowledge there is none. Most of his&para;<br>dissent is devoted to the proposition that parents have traditionally had&para;<br>the power to control what their children hear and say. This is true&para;<br>enough. And it perhaps follows from this that the state has the power&para;<br>to enforce parental prohibitions—to require, for example, that the&para;<br>promoters of a rock concert exclude those minors whose parents have&para;<br>advised the promoters that their children are forbidden to attend. But&para;<br>it does not follow that the state has the power to prevent children from&para;<br>hearing or saying anything without their parents’ prior consent. The&para;<br>latter would mean, for example, that it could be made criminal to admit&para;<br>persons under 18 to a political rally without their parents’ prior written&para;<br>consent—even a political rally in support of laws against corporal&para;<br>punishment of children, or laws in favor of greater rights for minors.&para;<br>And what is good for First Amendment rights of speech must be good&para;<br>for First Amendment rights of religion as well: It could be made crimi&para;<br>nal to admit a person under 18 to church, or to give a person under 18 a&para;<br>religious tract, without his parents’ prior consent. Our point is not, as&para;<br>JUSTICE THOMAS believes, post, at 16, n. 2, merely that such laws are&para;<br>“undesirable.” They are obviously an infringement upon the religious&para;<br>freedom of young people and those who wish to proselytize young&para;<br>people. Such laws do not enforce parental authority over children’s&para;<br>speech and religion; they impose governmental authority, subject only&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v.

Certainly the books we give children to read—or&para;<br>read to them when they are younger—contain no shortage&para;<br>of gore. Grimm’s Fairy Tales, for example, are grim in&para;<br>deed.

While “perfect clarity and precise guidance&para;<br>have never been required even of regulations that restrict&para;<br>expressive activity,” Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491&para;<br>U.

In an effort to avoid First Amendment prob&para;<br>lems, the California Legislature modeled its violent video&para;<br>game statute on the New York law that this Court upheld&para;<br>in Ginsberg v.

S. 413 (1966).&para;<br>Seeking to bring its violent video game law within the&para;<br>protection of Ginsberg, the California Legislature began&para;<br>with the obscenity test adopted in Miller v. California, 413&para;<br>U. S. 15 (1973), a decision that revised the obscenity tests&para;<br>previously set out in Roth and Memoirs. The legislature&para;<br>then made certain modifications to accommodate the aim&para;<br>of the violent video game law.&para;<br>Under Miller, an obscenity statute must contain a thresh&para;<br>old limitation that restricts the statute’s scope to specifi&para;<br>cally described “hard core” materials. See 413 U. S.,&para;<br>at 23–25, 27. Materials that fall within this “hard core”&para;<br>category may be deemed to be obscene if three additional&para;<br>requirements are met:&para;<br>(1) an “average person, applying contemporary com&para;<br>munity standards [must] find . . . the work, taken as a&para;<br>whole, appeals to the prurient interest”;&para;<br>(2) “the work [must] depic[t] or describ[e], in a pat&para;<br>ently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically de&para;<br>fined by the applicable state law; and”&para;<br>(3) “the work, taken as a whole, [must] lac[k] serious&para;<br>literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.” Id., at&para;<br>24 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Adapting these standards, the California law imposes&para;<br>the following threshold limitation: “[T]he range of options&para;<br>available to a player [must] includ[e] killing, maiming,&para;<br>dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a hu&para;<br>man being.” §1746(d)(1). Any video game that meets this&para;<br>threshold test is subject to the law’s restrictions if it also&para;<br>satisfies three further requirements:&para;<br>“(i) A reasonable person, considering the game as a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>whole, would find [the game] appeals to a deviant or&para;<br>morbid interest of minors.&para;<br>“(ii) It is patently offensive to prevailing standards&para;<br>in the community as to what is suitable for minors.&para;<br>“(iii) It causes the game, as a whole, to lack serious&para;<br>literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for mi&para;<br>nors.” §1746(d)(1)(A).2&para;<br>C&para;<br>The first important difference between the Ginsberg law&para;<br>and the California violent video game statute concerns&para;<br>their respective threshold requirements. As noted, the&para;<br>Ginsberg law built upon the test for adult obscenity, and&para;<br>the current adult obscenity test, which was set out in&para;<br>Miller, requires an obscenity statute to contain a threshold&para;<br>limitation that restricts the statute’s coverage to specifi&para;<br>cally defined “hard core” depictions. See 413 U. S., at 23–&para;<br>25, 27. The Miller Court gave as an example a statute&para;<br>that applies to only “[p]atently offensive representations&para;<br>or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts,” “masturbation,&para;<br>excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.”&para;<br>Id., at 25. The Miller Court clearly viewed this threshold&para;<br>limitation as serving a vital notice function. “We are&para;<br>satisfied,” the Court wrote, “that these specific prerequi&para;<br>sites will provide fair notice to a dealer in such materials&para;<br>that his public and commercial activities may bring prose&para;<br>cution.” Id., at 27; see also Reno, supra, at 873 (observing&para;<br>that Miller’s threshold limitation “reduces the vagueness&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Under the California law, a game that meets the threshold require&para;<br>ment set out in text also qualifies as “violent” if it “[e]nables the player&para;<br>to virtually inflict serious injury upon images of human beings or&para;<br>characters with substantially human characteristics in a manner which&para;<br>is especially heinous, cruel, or depraved in that it involves torture or&para;<br>serious physical abuse to the victim.” §1746(d)(1)(B). In the Court of&para;<br>Appeals, California conceded that this alternative definition is uncon&para;<br>stitutional, 556 F. 3d 950, 954, n. 5 (CA9 2009), and therefore only the&para;<br>requirements set out in text are now before us.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>inherent in the open-ended term ‘patently offensive’ ”).3&para;<br>By contrast, the threshold requirement of the California&para;<br>law does not perform the narrowing function served by the&para;<br>limitation in Miller. At least when Miller was decided,&para;<br>depictions of “hard core” sexual conduct were not a com&para;<br>mon feature of mainstream entertainment. But nothing&para;<br>similar can be said about much of the conduct covered by&para;<br>the California law. It provides that a video game cannot&para;<br>qualify as “violent” unless “the range of options available&para;<br>to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or&para;<br>sexually assaulting an image of a human being.”&para;<br>§1746(d)(1).&para;<br>For better or worse, our society has long regarded many&para;<br>depictions of killing and maiming4 as suitable features of&para;<br>popular entertainment, including entertainment that is&para;<br>widely available to minors. The California law’s threshold&para;<br>requirement would more closely resemble the limitation in&para;<br>Miller if it targeted a narrower class of graphic depictions.&para;<br>Because of this feature of the California law’s threshold&para;<br>test, the work of providing fair notice is left in large part&para;<br>to the three requirements that follow, but those elements&para;<br>are also not up to the task. In drafting the violent video&para;<br>game law, the California Legislature could have made its&para;<br>own judgment regarding the kind and degree of violence&para;<br>that is acceptable in games played by minors (or by minors&para;<br>in particular age groups). Instead, the legislature relied&para;<br>on undefined societal or community standards.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The provision of New York law under which the petitioner was con&para;<br>victed in Ginsberg was framed with similar specificity. This provision&para;<br>applied to depictions of “nudity” and “sexual conduct,” and both those&para;<br>terms were specifically and unambiguously defined. See 390 U. S., at&para;<br>645–647 (Appendix A to opinion of the Court).&para;<br>4 The California law does not define the term “maiming,” nor has the&para;<br>State cited any decisions from its courts that define the term in this&para;<br>context. Accordingly, I take the term to have its ordinary meaning,&para;<br>which includes the infliction of any serious wound, see Webster’s Third&para;<br>New International Dictionary 1362 (2002) (hereinafter Webster’s).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>One of the three elements at issue here refers expressly&para;<br>to “prevailing standards in the community as to what is&para;<br>suitable for minors.” §1746(d)(1)(A)(ii). Another element&para;<br>points in the same direction, asking whether “[a] reason&para;<br>able person, considering [a] game as a whole,” would find&para;<br>that it “appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors.”&para;<br>§1746(d)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added).&para;<br>The terms “deviant” and “morbid” are not defined in&para;<br>the statute, and California offers no reason to think that&para;<br>its courts would give the terms anything other than their&para;<br>ordinary meaning. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 5 (argu&para;<br>ing that “[a] reasonable person can make this judgment&para;<br>through . . . a common understanding and definition of the&para;<br>applicable terms”). I therefore assume that “deviant” and&para;<br>“morbid” carry the meaning that they convey in ordinary&para;<br>speech. The adjective “deviant” ordinarily means “deviat&para;<br>ing . . . from some accepted norm,” and the term “morbid”&para;<br>means “of, relating to, or characteristic of disease.” Web&para;<br>ster’s 618, 1469. A “deviant or morbid interest” in&para;<br>violence, therefore, appears to be an interest that de&para;<br>viates from what is regarded—presumably in accordance&para;<br>with some generally accepted standard—as normal and&para;<br>healthy. Thus, the application of the California law is&para;<br>heavily dependent on the identification of generally ac&para;<br>cepted standards regarding the suitability of violent enter&para;<br>tainment for minors.&para;<br>The California Legislature seems to have assumed that&para;<br>these standards are sufficiently well known so that a&para;<br>person of ordinary intelligence would have fair notice as to&para;<br>whether the kind and degree of violence in a particular&para;<br>game is enough to qualify the game as “violent.” And&para;<br>because the Miller test looks to community standards, the&para;<br>legislature may have thought that the use of undefined&para;<br>community standards in the violent video game law would&para;<br>not present vagueness problems.&para;<br>There is a critical difference, however, between obscen&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>ity laws and laws regulating violence in entertainment.&para;<br>By the time of this Court’s landmark obscenity cases in&para;<br>the 1960’s, obscenity had long been prohibited, see Roth,&para;<br>354 U. S., at 484–485, and this experience had helped to&para;<br>shape certain generally accepted norms concerning ex&para;<br>pression related to sex.&para;<br>There is no similar history regarding expression related&para;<br>to violence. As the Court notes, classic literature contains&para;<br>descriptions of great violence, and even children’s stories&para;<br>sometimes depict very violent scenes. See ante, at 8–9.&para;<br>Although our society does not generally regard all depic&para;<br>tions of violence as suitable for children or adolescents, the&para;<br>prevalence of violent depictions in children’s literature and&para;<br>entertainment creates numerous opportunities for reason&para;<br>able people to disagree about which depictions may excite&para;<br>“deviant” or “morbid” impulses. See Edwards &amp; Berman,&para;<br>Regulating Violence on Television, 89 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1487,&para;<br>1523 (1995) (observing that the Miller test would be diffi&para;<br>cult to apply to violent expression because “there is noth&para;<br>ing even approaching a consensus on low-value violence”).&para;<br>Finally, the difficulty of ascertaining the community&para;<br>standards incorporated into the California law is com&para;<br>pounded by the legislature’s decision to lump all minors&para;<br>together. The California law draws no distinction between&para;<br>young children and adolescents who are nearing the age of&para;<br>majority.&para;<br>In response to a question at oral argument, the attorney&para;<br>defending the constitutionality of the California law said&para;<br>that the State would accept a narrowing construction of&para;<br>the law under which the law’s references to “minors”&para;<br>would be interpreted to refer to the oldest minors—that is,&para;<br>those just short of 18. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11–12. However,&para;<br>“it is not within our power to construe and narrow state&para;<br>laws.” Grayned, 408 U. S., at 110.

And I would go no further. I would&para;<br>not express any view on whether a properly drawn statute&para;<br>would or would not survive First Amendment scrutiny.&para;<br>We should address that question only if and when it is&para;<br>necessary to do so.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Having outlined how I would decide this case, I will now&para;<br>briefly elaborate on my reasons for questioning the wis&para;<br>dom of the Court’s approach. Some of these reasons are&para;<br>touched upon by the dissents, and while I am not prepared&para;<br>at this time to go as far as either JUSTICE THOMAS or&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER, they raise valid concerns.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Court is wrong in saying that the holding in United&para;<br>States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___ (2010), “controls this case.”&para;<br>Ante, at 4. First, the statute in Stevens differed sharply&para;<br>from the statute at issue here. Stevens struck down a law&para;<br>that broadly prohibited any person from creating, selling,&para;<br>or possessing depictions of animal cruelty for commercial&para;<br>gain. The California law involved here, by contrast, is&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 At oral argument, California also proposed that the term “minors”&para;<br>could be interpreted as referring to the “typical age group of minors”&para;<br>who play video games. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. But nothing in the law’s&para;<br>text supports such a limitation. Nor has California cited any decisions&para;<br>indicating that its courts would restrict the law in this way. And there&para;<br>is nothing in the record indicating what this age group might be.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>limited to the sale or rental of violent video games to&para;<br>minors. The California law imposes no restriction on the&para;<br>creation of violent video games, or on the possession of&para;<br>such games by anyone, whether above or below the age of&para;<br>18. The California law does not regulate the sale or rental&para;<br>of violent games by adults. And the California law does&para;<br>not prevent parents and certain other close relatives from&para;<br>buying or renting violent games for their children or other&para;<br>young relatives if they see fit.&para;<br>Second, Stevens does not support the proposition that a&para;<br>law like the one at issue must satisfy strict scrutiny. The&para;<br>portion of Stevens on which the Court relies rejected the&para;<br>Government’s contention that depictions of animal cruelty&para;<br>were categorically outside the range of any First Amend&para;<br>ment protection. 559 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 5). Going&para;<br>well beyond Stevens, the Court now holds that any law&para;<br>that attempts to prevent minors from purchasing violent&para;<br>video games must satisfy strict scrutiny instead of the&para;<br>more lenient standard applied in Ginsberg, 390 U. S. 629,&para;<br>our most closely related precedent. As a result of today’s&para;<br>decision, a State may prohibit the sale to minors of what&para;<br>Ginsberg described as “girlie magazines,” but a State must&para;<br>surmount a formidable (and perhaps insurmountable)&para;<br>obstacle if it wishes to prevent children from purchasing&para;<br>the most violent and depraved video games imaginable.&para;<br>Third, Stevens expressly left open the possibility that a&para;<br>more narrowly drawn statute targeting depictions of&para;<br>animal cruelty might be compatible with the First&para;<br>Amendment. See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). In this&para;<br>case, the Court’s sweeping opinion will likely be read by&para;<br>many, both inside and outside the video-game industry, as&para;<br>suggesting that no regulation of minors’ access to violent&para;<br>video games is allowed—at least without supporting evi&para;<br>dence that may not be realistically obtainable given the&para;<br>nature of the phenomenon in question.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

I certainly agree with the Court that the government&para;<br>has no “free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which&para;<br>children may be exposed,” ante, at 7, but the California&para;<br>law does not exercise such a power. If parents want their&para;<br>child to have a violent video game, the California law does&para;<br>not interfere with that parental prerogative. Instead, the&para;<br>California law reinforces parental decisionmaking in&para;<br>exactly the same way as the New York statute upheld in&para;<br>Ginsberg. Under both laws, minors are prevented from&para;<br>purchasing certain materials; and under both laws, par&para;<br>ents are free to supply their children with these items if&para;<br>that is their wish.&para;<br>Citing the video-game industry’s voluntary rating sys&para;<br>tem, the Court argues that the California law does not&para;<br>“meet a substantial need of parents who wish to restrict&para;<br>their children’s access to violent video games but cannot&para;<br>do so.” Ante, at 15. The Court does not mention the fact&para;<br>that the industry adopted this system in response to the&para;<br>threat of federal regulation, Brief for Activision Blizzard,&para;<br>Inc., as Amicus Curiae 7–10, a threat that the Court’s&para;<br>opinion may now be seen as largely eliminating. Nor does&para;<br>the Court acknowledge that compliance with this system&para;<br>at the time of the enactment of the California law left&para;<br>much to be desired6—or that future enforcement may&para;<br>decline if the video-game industry perceives that any&para;<br>threat of government regulation has vanished.

[A]bove all things and at&para;<br>all times let your clothes be neat, whole, and properly put&para;<br>on”). Jefferson expected his daughter, Martha, to write&para;<br>“by every post” and instructed her, “Inform me what books&para;<br>you read [and] what tunes you learn.” Letter (Nov. 28,&para;<br>1783), in id., at 44. He took the same approach with his&para;<br>nephew, Peter Carr, after Carr’s father died. See Letter&para;<br>(Aug. 19, 1785), in 8 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 405–&para;<br>408 (J.

See MacLeod&para;<br>24–25, 42–48; see also id., at 42 (“The authors of juvenile&para;<br>fiction imposed the constraints upon themselves in the&para;<br>name of duty, and for the sake of giving children what&para;<br>they thought children should have, although they were&para;<br>often well aware that children might prefer more excit&para;<br>ing fare”); Francis, American Children’s Literature,&para;<br>1646–1880, in American Childhood 208–209 (J.

According to Sir&para;<br>William Blackstone, parents were responsible for main&para;<br>taining, protecting, and education their children, and&para;<br>therefore had “power” over their children. 1 Commentar&para;<br>ies on the Laws of England 434, 440 (1765); cf. Washington&para;<br>v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 712 (1997) (Blackstone’s&para;<br>Commentaries was “a primary legal authority for 18thand 19th-century American lawyers”). Chancellor James&para;<br>Kent agreed. 2 Commentaries on American Law *189–&para;<br>*207. The law entitled parents to “the custody of their&para;<br>[children],” “the value of th[e] [children’s] labor and ser&para;<br>vices,” and the “right to the exercise of such discipline as&para;<br>may be requisite for the discharge of their sacred trust.”&para;<br>Id., at *193, *203. Children, in turn, were charged with&para;<br>“obedience and assistance during their own minority, and&para;<br>gratitude and reverance during the rest of their lives.” Id.,&para;<br>at *207.&para;<br>Thus, in case after case, courts made clear that parents&para;<br>had a right to the child’s labor and services until the child&para;<br>reached majority. In 1810, the Supreme Judicial Court of&para;<br>Massachusetts explained, “There is no question but that a&para;<br>father, who is entitled to the services of his minor son, and&para;<br>for whom he is obliged to provide, may, at the common&para;<br>law, assign those services to others, for a consideration to&para;<br>enure to himself.” Day v. Everett, 7 Mass. 145, 147; see&para;<br>also Benson v. Remington, 2 Mass. 113, 115 (1806) (opin&para;<br>ion of Parsons, C. J.) (“The law is very well settled, that&para;<br>parents are under obligations to support their children,&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>and that they are entitled to their earnings”). Similarly,&para;<br>the Supreme Court of Judicature of New Hampshire noted&para;<br>that the right of parents to recover for the services of their&para;<br>child, while a minor, “cannot be contested.” Gale v. Parrot,&para;<br>1 N. H. 28, 29 (1817). And parents could bring tort suits&para;<br>against those who knowingly enticed a minor away from&para;<br>them. See, e.g., Kirkpatrick v. Lockhart, 2 Brev. 276 (S. C.&para;<br>Constitutional Ct. 1809); Jones v. Tevis, 4 Litt. 25 (Ky.&para;<br>App. 1823).&para;<br>Relatedly, boys could not enlist in the military without&para;<br>parental consent. Many of those who did so during the&para;<br>Revolutionary War found, afterwards, that their fathers&para;<br>were entitled to their military wages. See Cox, Boy Sol&para;<br>diers of the American Revolution, in Marten 21–24. And&para;<br>after the war, minors who enlisted without parental con&para;<br>sent in violation of federal law could find themselves&para;<br>returned home on writs of habeas corpus issued at their&para;<br>parents’ request. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 24&para;<br>F. Cas. 813 (No. 14,449) (CC Tenn. 1812); Commonwealth&para;<br>v. Callan, 6 Binn. 255 (Pa. 1814) (per curiam).&para;<br>Laws also set age limits restricting marriage without&para;<br>parental consent. For example, from 1730 until at least&para;<br>1849, Pennsylvania law required parental consent for the&para;<br>marriage of anyone under the age of 21. See 4 Statutes at&para;<br>Large of Pennsylvania 153 (J. Mitchell &amp; H. Flanders eds.&para;<br>1897) (hereinafter Pa. Stats. at Large); General Laws of&para;<br>Pennsylvania 82–83 (J.

Cushing ed. 1981).&para;<br>In general, “[p]ostRevolutionary marriage law assumed that below a certain&para;<br>age, children could . . . no[t] intellectually understand its&para;<br>significance.” Grossberg 105.&para;<br>Indeed, the law imposed age limits on all manner of&para;<br>activities that required judgment and reason.

The Puritan tradition in New&para;<br>England laid the foundation of American parental author&para;<br>ity and duty. See MacDonald 6 (“The Puritans are virtu&para;<br>ally the inventors of the family as we know it today”). In&para;<br>the decades leading up to and following the Revolution,&para;<br>the conception of the child’s mind evolved but the duty and&para;<br>authority of parents remained. Indeed, society paid closer&para;<br>attention to potential influences on children than before.&para;<br>See Mintz 72 (“By weakening earlier forms of patriarchal&para;<br>authority, the Revolution enhanced the importance of&para;<br>childrearing and education in ensuring social stability”).&para;<br>Teachers and schools came under scrutiny, and children’s&para;<br>reading material was carefully supervised. Laws reflected&para;<br>these concerns and often supported parental authority&para;<br>with the coercive power of the state.&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>In light of this history, the Framers could not possibly&para;<br>have understood “the freedom of speech” to include an&para;<br>unqualified right to speak to minors.

ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>stood “the freedom of speech” to include a right to speak to&para;<br>children without going through their parents. As a conse&para;<br>quence, I do not believe that laws limiting such speech—&para;<br>for example, by requiring parental consent to speak to a&para;<br>minor—“abridg[e] the freedom of speech” within the origi&para;<br>nal meaning of the First Amendment.&para;<br>We have recently noted that this Court does not have&para;<br>“freewheeling authority to declare new categories of&para;<br>speech outside the scope of the First Amendment.” Ste&para;<br>vens, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). But we also recog&para;<br>nized that there may be “some categories of speech that&para;<br>have been historically unprotected [and] have not yet been&para;<br>specifically identified or discussed as such in our case&para;<br>law.” Ibid. In my opinion, the historical evidence here&para;<br>plainly reveals one such category.2&para;<br>B&para;<br>Admittedly, the original public understanding of a&para;<br>constitutional provision does not always comport with&para;<br>modern sensibilities.&para;<br>See Morse, 551 U. S., at 419&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., concurring) (treating students “as though it&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The majority responds that “it does not follow” from the historical&para;<br>evidence “that the state has the power to prevent children from hearing&para;<br>. . . anything without their parents’ prior consent.” Ante, at 7, n. 3.&para;<br>Such a conclusion, the majority asserts, would lead to laws that, in its&para;<br>view, would be undesirable and “obviously” unconstitutional. Ibid.&para;<br>The majority’s circular argument misses the point. The question is&para;<br>not whether certain laws might make sense to judges or legislators&para;<br>today, but rather what the public likely understood “the freedom of&para;<br>speech” to mean when the First Amendment was adopted. See District&para;<br>of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 634–635 (2008). I believe it is&para;<br>clear that the founding public would not have understood “the freedom&para;<br>of speech” to include speech to minor children bypassing their parents.&para;<br>It follows that the First Amendment imposes no restriction on state&para;<br>regulation of such speech. To note that there may not be “precedent for&para;<br>[such] state control,” ante, at 8, n. 3, “is not to establish that [there] is a&para;<br>constitutional right,” McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 U. S. 334,&para;<br>373 (1995) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

It may also be inconsistent with precedent. See&para;<br>McDonald, 561 U.

Although much has&para;<br>changed in this country since the Revolution, the notion&para;<br>that parents have authority over their children and that&para;<br>the law can support that authority persists today. For&para;<br>example, at least some States make it a crime to lure or&para;<br>entice a minor away from the minor’s parent. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Cal. Penal Code Ann. §272(b)(1) (West 2008); Fla. Stat.&para;<br>§787.03 (2010). Every State in the Union still establishes&para;<br>a minimum age for marriage without parental or judicial&para;<br>consent. Cf. Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 558 (Ap&para;<br>pendix D to opinion of Court) (2005). Individuals less than&para;<br>18 years old cannot enlist in the military without parental&para;<br>consent. 10 U. S. C. §505(a). And minors remain subject&para;<br>to curfew laws across the country, see Brief for Louisiana&para;<br>et al. as Amici Curiae 16, and cannot unilaterally consent&para;<br>to most medical procedures, id., at 15.&para;<br>Moreover, there are many things minors today cannot&para;<br>do at all, whether they have parental consent or not.&para;<br>State laws set minimum ages for voting and jury duty.&para;<br>See Roper, supra, at 581–585 (Appendixes B and C to&para;<br>opinion of Court). In California (the State at issue here),&para;<br>minors cannot drive for hire or drive a school bus, Cal.&para;<br>Veh. Code Ann. §§12515, 12516 (West 2010), purchase&para;<br>tobacco, Cal.

Probate&para;<br>Code Ann. §6220 (West 2009).&para;<br>My understanding of “the freedom of speech” is also&para;<br>consistent with this Court’s precedents. To be sure, the&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Court has held that children are entitled to the protection&para;<br>of the First Amendment, see, e.g., Erznoznik v. Jackson&para;<br>ville, 422 U. S. 205, 212–213 (1975), and the government&para;<br>may not unilaterally dictate what children can say or&para;<br>hear, see id., at 213–214; Tinker v. Des Moines Independ&para;<br>ent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 511 (1969).&para;<br>But this Court has never held, until today, that “the free&para;<br>dom of speech” includes a right to speak to minors (or a&para;<br>right of minors to access speech) without going through&para;<br>the minors’ parents. To the contrary, “[i]t is well settled&para;<br>that a State or municipality can adopt more stringent&para;<br>controls on communicative materials available to youths&para;<br>than on those available to adults.” Erznoznik, supra, at&para;<br>212; cf. post, at 3 (BREYER, J., dissenting).&para;<br>The Court’s constitutional jurisprudence “historically&para;<br>has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as&para;<br>a unit with broad parental authority over minor children.”&para;<br>Parham v.

Under that&para;<br>case law, “legislature[s] [can] properly conclude that par&para;<br>ents and others, teachers for example, who have . . . pri&para;<br>mary responsibility for children’s well-being are entitled to&para;<br>the support of laws designed to aid discharge of that re&para;<br>sponsibility.” Ginsberg v.

That&para;<br>area lies at the heart of the statute.

In doing so,&para;<br>the special First Amendment category I find relevant is&para;<br>not (as the Court claims) the category of “depictions of&para;<br>violence,” ante, at 8, but rather the category of “protection&para;<br>of children.” This Court has held that the “power of the&para;<br>state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the&para;<br>scope of its authority over adults.” Prince v. Massachu&para;<br>setts, 321 U. S. 158, 170 (1944). And the “ ‘regulatio[n] of&para;<br>communication addressed to [children] need not conform&para;<br>to the requirements of the [F]irst [A]mendment in the&para;<br>same way as those applicable to adults.’ ” Ginsberg v.

No one here argues&para;<br>that depictions of violence, even extreme violence, auto&para;<br>matically fall outside the First Amendment’s protective&para;<br>scope as, for example, do obscenity and depictions of child&para;<br>pornography. We properly speak of categories of expres­&para;<br>sion that lack protection when, like “child pornography,”&para;<br>the category is broad, when it applies automatically, and&para;<br>when the State can prohibit everyone, including adults,&para;<br>from obtaining access to the material within it. But&para;<br>where, as here, careful analysis must precede a narrower&para;<br>judicial conclusion (say, denying protection to a shout of&para;<br>“fire” in a crowded theater, or to an effort to teach a terror­&para;<br>ist group how to peacefully petition the United Nations),&para;<br>we do not normally describe the result as creating a “new&para;<br>category of unprotected speech.” See Schenck v.

United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 304&para;<br>(2008). Ginsberg explains why that is so. The Court there&para;<br>considered a New York law that forbade the sale to minors&para;<br>of a&para;<br>“picture, photograph, drawing, sculpture, motion pic­&para;<br>ture film, or similar visual representation or image of&para;<br>a person or portion of the human body which depicts&para;<br>nudity . . . ,”&para;<br>that&para;<br>“predominately appeals to the prurient, shameful or&para;<br>morbid interest of minors,”&para;<br>and&para;<br>“is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the&para;<br>adult community as a whole with respect to what is&para;<br>suitable material for minors,”&para;<br>and&para;<br>“is utterly without redeeming social importance for&para;<br>minors.” 390 U.

The five-Justice majority, in an opinion writ­&para;<br>ten by Justice Brennan, wrote that the statute was sufficiently clear. 390 U. S., at 643–645. No Member of the&para;<br>Court voiced any vagueness objection. See id., at 648–650&para;<br>(Stewart, J., concurring in result); id., at 650–671 (Doug­&para;<br>las, J., joined by Black, J., dissenting); id., at 671–675&para;<br>(Fortas, J., dissenting).&para;<br>Comparing the language of California’s statute (set&para;<br>forth supra, at 1–2) with the language of New York’s&para;<br>statute (set forth immediately above), it is difficult to find&para;<br>any vagueness-related difference. Why are the words&para;<br>“kill,” “maim,” and “dismember” any more difficult to&para;<br>understand than the word “nudity?” JUSTICE ALITO ob­&para;<br>jects that these words do “not perform the narrowing&para;<br>function” that this Court has required in adult obscenity&para;<br>cases, where statutes can only cover “ ‘hard core’ ” depic­&para;<br>tions. Ante, at 6 (opinion concurring in judgment). But&para;<br>the relevant comparison is not to adult obscenity cases but&para;<br>to Ginsberg, which dealt with “nudity,” a category no more&para;<br>“narrow” than killing and maiming. And in any event,&para;<br>narrowness and vagueness do not necessarily have any­&para;<br>thing to do with one another. All that is required for&para;<br>vagueness purposes is that the terms “kill,” “maim,” and&para;<br>“dismember” give fair notice as to what they cover, which&para;<br>they do.&para;<br>The remainder of California’s definition copies, almost&para;<br>word for word, the language this Court used in Miller v.&para;<br>California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973), in permitting a total ban&para;<br>on material that satisfied its definition (one enforced with&para;<br>criminal penalties). The California law’s reliance on&para;<br>“community standards” adheres to Miller, and in Fort&para;<br>Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U. S. 46, 57–58 (1989),&para;<br>this Court specifically upheld the use of Miller’s language&para;<br>against charges of vagueness. California only departed&para;<br>from the Miller formulation in two significant respects: It&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>substituted the word “deviant” for the words “prurient”&para;<br>and “shameful,” and it three times added the words “for&para;<br>minors.” The word “deviant” differs from “prurient” and&para;<br>“shameful,” but it would seem no less suited to defining&para;<br>and narrowing the reach of the statute. And the addition&para;<br>of “for minors” to a version of the Miller standard was&para;<br>approved in Ginsberg, 390 U. S., at 643, even though the&para;<br>New York law “dr[ew] no distinction between young chil­&para;<br>dren and adolescents who are nearing the age of majority,”&para;<br>ante, at 8 (opinion of ALITO, J.).&para;<br>Both the Miller standard and the law upheld in Gins&para;<br>berg lack perfect clarity. But that fact reflects the dif­&para;<br>ficulty of the Court’s long search for words capable of&para;<br>protecting expression without depriving the State of a&para;<br>legitimate constitutional power to regulate. As is well&para;<br>known, at one point Justice Stewart thought he could do&para;<br>no better in defining obscenity than, “I know it when I see&para;<br>it.” Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U. S. 184, 197 (1964) (concur­&para;<br>ring opinion). And Justice Douglas dissented from Miller’s&para;<br>standard, which he thought was still too vague. 413 U. S.,&para;<br>at 39–40. Ultimately, however, this Court accepted the&para;<br>“community standards” tests used in Miller and Ginsberg.&para;<br>They reflect the fact that sometimes, even when a precise&para;<br>standard proves elusive, it is easy enough to identify&para;<br>instances that fall within a legitimate regulation. And&para;<br>they seek to draw a line, which, while favoring free ex­&para;<br>pression, will nonetheless permit a legislature to find the&para;<br>words necessary to accomplish a legitimate constitutional&para;<br>objective. Cf. Williams, supra, at 304 (the Constitution&para;<br>does not always require “ ‘perfect clarity and precise guid­&para;<br>ance,’ ” even when “ ‘expressive activity’ ” is involved).&para;<br>What, then, is the difference between Ginsberg and&para;<br>Miller on the one hand and the California law on the&para;<br>other? It will often be easy to pick out cases at which&para;<br>California’s statute directly aims, involving, say, a charac­&para;<br>ter who shoots out a police officer’s knee, douses him with&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>gasoline, lights him on fire, urinates on his burning body,&para;<br>and finally kills him with a gunshot to the head. (Footage of one such game sequence has been submitted in the&para;<br>record.) See also ante, at 14–15 (ALITO, J., concurring in&para;<br>judgment). As in Miller and Ginsberg, the California law&para;<br>clearly protects even the most violent games that possess&para;<br>serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.&para;<br>§1746(d)(1)(A)(iii). And it is easier here than in Miller&para;<br>or Ginsberg to separate the sheep from the goats at the&para;<br>statute’s border. That is because here the industry itself has promulgated standards and created a review&para;<br>process, in which adults who “typically have experience&para;<br>with children” assess what games are inappropriate for&para;<br>minors. See Entertainment Software Rating Board, Rating&para;<br>Process, online at http://www.esrb.org/ratings/&amp;ratings_&para;<br>process.jsp (all Internet materials as visited June 24,&para;<br>2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).&para;<br>There is, of course, one obvious difference: The Ginsberg&para;<br>statute concerned depictions of “nudity,” while California’s&para;<br>statute concerns extremely violent video games. But for&para;<br>purposes of vagueness, why should that matter? JUSTICE&para;<br>ALITO argues that the Miller standard sufficed because&para;<br>there are “certain generally accepted norms concerning&para;<br>expression related to sex,” whereas there are no similarly&para;<br>“accepted standards regarding the suitability of violent&para;<br>entertainment.” Ante, at 7–8. But there is no evidence&para;<br>that is so. The Court relied on “community standards” in&para;<br>Miller precisely because of the difficulty of articulating&para;<br>“accepted norms” about depictions of sex. I can find no&para;<br>difference—historical or otherwise—that is relevant to the&para;<br>vagueness question. Indeed, the majority’s examples of&para;<br>literary descriptions of violence, on which JUSTICE ALITO&para;<br>relies, do not show anything relevant at all.&para;<br>After all, one can find in literature as many (if not more)&para;<br>descriptions of physical love as descriptions of violence.&para;<br>Indeed, sex “has been a theme in art and literature&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>throughout the ages.” Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,&para;<br>535 U. S. 234, 246 (2002). For every Homer, there is a&para;<br>Titian. For every Dante, there is an Ovid. And for all the&para;<br>teenagers who have read the original versions of Grimm’s&para;<br>Fairy Tales, I suspect there are those who know the story&para;<br>of Lady Godiva.&para;<br>Thus, I can find no meaningful vagueness-related dif­&para;<br>ferences between California’s law and the New York law&para;<br>upheld in Ginsberg. And if there remain any vagueness&para;<br>problems, the state courts can cure them through inter­&para;<br>pretation. See Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205,&para;<br>216 (1975) (“[S]tate statute should not be deemed facially&para;<br>invalid unless it is not readily subject to a narrowing&para;<br>construction by the state courts”). Cf. Ginsberg, supra, at&para;<br>644 (relying on the fact that New York Court of Appeals&para;<br>would read a knowledge requirement into the statute);&para;<br>Berry v. Santa Barbara, 40 Cal. App. 4th 1075, 1088–&para;<br>1089, 47 Cal. Rptr. 2d 661, 669 (1995) (reading a knowl­&para;<br>edge requirement into a statute). Consequently, for pur­&para;<br>poses of this facial challenge, I would not find the statute&para;<br>unconstitutionally vague.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Video games combine physical action with expression.&para;<br>Were physical activity to predominate in a game, govern­&para;<br>ment could appropriately intervene, say by requiring&para;<br>parents to accompany children when playing a game in­&para;<br>volving actual target practice, or restricting the sale of&para;<br>toys presenting physical dangers to children. See gener­&para;<br>ally Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008,&para;<br>122 Stat. 3016 (“Title I—Children’s Product Safety”). But&para;<br>because video games also embody important expressive&para;<br>and artistic elements, I agree with the Court that the First&para;<br>Amendment significantly limits the State’s power to regu­&para;<br>late. And I would determine whether the State has ex­&para;<br>ceeded those limits by applying a strict standard of review.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

American Civil&para;<br>Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 874, 875, 879 (1997). I&para;<br>would not apply this strict standard “mechanically.”&para;<br>United States v.

Rather,&para;<br>in applying it, I would evaluate the degree to which the&para;<br>statute injures speech-related interests, the nature of the&para;<br>potentially-justifying “compelling interests,” the degree to&para;<br>which the statute furthers that interest, the nature and&para;<br>effectiveness of possible alternatives, and, in light of this&para;<br>evaluation, whether, overall, “the statute works speech­&para;<br>related harm . . . out of proportion to the benefits that the&para;<br>statute seeks to provide.” Ibid. See also Burson v. Free&para;<br>man, 504 U. S. 191, 210 (1992) (plurality opinion) (apply­&para;<br>ing strict scrutiny and finding relevant the lack of a&para;<br>“significant impingement” on speech).&para;<br>First Amendment standards applied in this way are&para;<br>difficult but not impossible to satisfy. Applying “strict&para;<br>scrutiny” the Court has upheld restrictions on speech that,&para;<br>for example, ban the teaching of peaceful dispute resolu­&para;<br>tion to a group on the State Department’s list of terrorist&para;<br>organizations, Holder, 561 U.

And applying less clearly&para;<br>defined but still rigorous standards, the Court has allowed&para;<br>States to require disclosure of petition signers, Doe v.&para;<br>Reed, 561 U. S. ___ (2010), and to impose campaign con­&para;<br>tribution limits that were “ ‘closely drawn’ to match a&para;<br>‘sufficiently important interest,’ ” Nixon v. Shrink Missouri&para;<br>Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 387–388 (2000).&para;<br>Moreover, although the Court did not specify the “level&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>of scrutiny” it applied in Ginsberg, we have subsequently&para;<br>described that case as finding a “compelling interest” in&para;<br>protecting children from harm sufficient to justify limita­&para;<br>tions on speech. See Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v.&para;<br>FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126 (1989). Since the Court in Gins&para;<br>berg specified that the statute’s prohibition applied to&para;<br>material that was not obscene, 390 U. S., at 634, I cannot&para;<br>dismiss Ginsberg on the ground that it concerned obscen­&para;<br>ity. But cf. ante, at 6 (majority opinion). Nor need I de­&para;<br>pend upon the fact that the Court in Ginsberg insisted&para;<br>only that the legislature have a “rational” basis for finding&para;<br>the depictions there at issue harmful to children. 390&para;<br>U. S., at 639. For in this case, California has substan­&para;<br>tiated its claim of harm with considerably stronger&para;<br>evidence.&para;<br>A&para;<br>California’s law imposes no more than a modest restric­&para;<br>tion on expression. The statute prevents no one from&para;<br>playing a video game, it prevents no adult from buying a&para;<br>video game, and it prevents no child or adolescent from&para;<br>obtaining a game provided a parent is willing to help.&para;<br>§1746.1(c). All it prevents is a child or adolescent from&para;<br>buying, without a parent’s assistance, a gruesomely vio­&para;<br>lent video game of a kind that the industry itself tells us it&para;<br>wants to keep out of the hands of those under the age of&para;<br>17. See Brief for Respondents 8.&para;<br>Nor is the statute, if upheld, likely to create a precedent that would adversely affect other media, say films, or&para;<br>videos, or books. A typical video game involves a signifi­&para;<br>cant amount of physical activity. See ante, at 13–14&para;<br>(ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (citing examples of the&para;<br>increasing interactivity of video game controllers).

See infra, at 14.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The interest that California advances in support of the&para;<br>statute is compelling. As this Court has previously de­&para;<br>scribed that interest, it consists of both (1) the “basic”&para;<br>parental claim “to authority in their own household to&para;<br>direct the rearing of their children,” which makes it proper&para;<br>to enact “laws designed to aid discharge of [parental]&para;<br>responsibility,” and (2) the State’s “independent interest in&para;<br>the well-being of its youth.” Ginsberg, 390 U. S., at 639–&para;<br>640. Cf. id., at 639, n. 7 (“ ‘[O]ne can well distinguish laws&para;<br>which do not impose a morality on children, but which&para;<br>support the right of parents to deal with the morals of&para;<br>their children as they see fit’ ” (quoting Henkin, Morals&para;<br>and the Constitution: The Sin of Obscenity, 63 Colum.&para;<br>L. Rev. 391, 413, n. 68 (1963))). And where these interests&para;<br>work in tandem, it is not fatally “underinclusive” for a&para;<br>State to advance its interests in protecting children&para;<br>against the special harms present in an interactive video&para;<br>game medium through a default rule that still allows&para;<br>parents to provide their children with what their parents&para;<br>wish.&para;<br>Both interests are present here. As to the need to help&para;<br>parents guide their children, the Court noted in 1968&para;<br>that “ ‘parental control or guidance cannot always be&para;<br>provided.’ ” 390 U. S., at 640. Today, 5.3 million grade­&para;<br>school-age children of working parents are routinely&para;<br>home alone. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau,&para;<br>Who’s Minding the Kids?

Thus, it has,&para;<br>if anything, become more important to supplement par­&para;<br>ents’ authority to guide their children’s development.&para;<br>As to the State’s independent interest, we have pointed&para;<br>out that juveniles are more likely to show a “ ‘lack of ma­&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v.

And we&para;<br>have therefore recognized “a compelling interest in pro­&para;<br>tecting the physical and psychological well-being of mi­&para;<br>nors.” Sable Communications, supra, at 126.&para;<br>At the same time, there is considerable evidence that&para;<br>California’s statute significantly furthers this compelling&para;<br>interest. That is, in part, because video games are excel­&para;<br>lent teaching tools. Learning a practical task often means&para;<br>developing habits, becoming accustomed to performing the&para;<br>task, and receiving positive reinforcement when perform­&para;<br>ing that task well. Video games can help develop habits,&para;<br>accustom the player to performance of the task, and&para;<br>reward the player for performing that task well. Why&para;<br>else would the Armed Forces incorporate video games&para;<br>into its training? See CNN, War Games: Military Train­&para;<br>ing Goes High-Tech (Nov. 22, 2001), online at&para;<br>http://articles.cnn.com/2001–11–2 / tech / war.games_1_ictbill-swartout-real-world-training?_s=PM:TECH.&para;<br>When the military uses video games to help soldiers&para;<br>train for missions, it is using this medium for a beneficial&para;<br>purpose. But California argues that when the teaching&para;<br>features of video games are put to less desirable ends,&para;<br>harm can ensue. In particular, extremely violent games&para;<br>can harm children by rewarding them for being violently&para;<br>aggressive in play, and thereby often teaching them to be&para;<br>violently aggressive in life. And video games can cause&para;<br>more harm in this respect than can typically passive&para;<br>media, such as books or films or television programs.&para;<br>There are many scientific studies that support Califor­&para;<br>nia’s views. Social scientists, for example, have found&para;<br>causal evidence that playing these games results in harm.&para;<br>Longitudinal studies, which measure changes over time,&para;<br>have found that increased exposure to violent video games&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

I, like most judges, lack the social science expertise&para;<br>to say definitively who is right.

[and, though less&para;<br>research had been done at that time, preliminary&para;<br>studies indicated that] the impact of violent interac­&para;<br>tive entertainment (video games and other interactive&para;<br>media) on young people . . . may be significantly more&para;<br>severe than that wrought by television, movies, or mu­&para;<br>sic.” Joint Statement on the Impact of Entertainment&para;<br>Violence on Children (2000) (emphasis added), online&para;<br>at http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/jstmtevc.htm.&para;<br>Five years later, after more research had been done, the&para;<br>American Psychological Association adopted a resolution&para;<br>that said:&para;<br>“[C]omprehensive analysis of violent interactive&para;<br>video game research suggests such exposure . . .&para;<br>increases aggressive behavior, . . . increases aggres­&para;<br>sive thoughts, . . . increases angry feelings, . . . de­&para;<br>creases helpful behavior, and . . . increases physiological arousal.” Resolution on Violence in Video&para;<br>Games and Interactive Media (2005), online at&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v.

(empha­&para;<br>sis added).&para;<br>Four years after that, in 2009, the American Academy of&para;<br>Pediatrics issued a statement in significant part about&para;<br>interactive media. It said:&para;<br>“Studies of these rapidly growing and ever-more­&para;<br>sophisticated types of media have indicated that the&para;<br>effects of child-initiated virtual violence may be even&para;<br>more profound than those of passive media such as&para;<br>television. In many games the child or teenager is&para;<br>‘embedded’ in the game and uses a ‘joystick’ (handheld&para;<br>controller) that enhances both the experience and the&para;<br>aggressive feelings.” Policy Statement—Media Vio­&para;<br>lence, 124 Pediatrics 1495, 1498 (2009) (emphasis&para;<br>added).&para;<br>It added:&para;<br>“Correlational and experimental studies have re­&para;<br>vealed that violent video games lead to increases in&para;<br>aggressive behavior and aggressive thinking and de­&para;<br>creases in prosocial behavior. Recent longitudinal&para;<br>studies . . . have revealed that in as little as 3 months,&para;<br>high exposure to violent video games increased physi­&para;<br>cal aggression. Other recent longitudinal studies . . .&para;<br>have revealed similar effects across 2 years.” Ibid.&para;<br>(footnotes omitted).&para;<br>Unlike the majority, I would find sufficient grounds in&para;<br>these studies and expert opinions for this Court to defer to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>an elected legislature’s conclusion that the video games in&para;<br>question are particularly likely to harm children. This&para;<br>Court has always thought it owed an elected legislature&para;<br>some degree of deference in respect to legislative facts of&para;<br>this kind, particularly when they involve technical mat­&para;<br>ters that are beyond our competence, and even in First&para;<br>Amendment cases. See Holder, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 28–29) (deferring, while applying strict scrutiny, to the&para;<br>Government’s national security judgments); Turner&para;<br>Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S. 180, 195–196&para;<br>(1997) (deferring, while applying intermediate scrutiny, to&para;<br>the Government’s technological judgments). The majority,&para;<br>in reaching its own, opposite conclusion about the validity&para;<br>of the relevant studies, grants the legislature no deference&para;<br>at all. Compare ante, at 12–13 (stating that the studies do&para;<br>not provide evidence that violent video games “cause”&para;<br>harm (emphasis deleted)), with supra, at 12–13 (citing&para;<br>longitudinal studies finding causation).&para;<br>C&para;<br>I can find no “less restrictive” alternative to California’s&para;<br>law that would be “at least as effective.” See Reno, 521&para;<br>U. S., at 874. The majority points to a voluntary alterna­&para;<br>tive: The industry tries to prevent those under 17 from&para;<br>buying extremely violent games by labeling those games&para;<br>with an “M” (Mature) and encouraging retailers to restrict&para;<br>their sales to those 17 and older. See ante, at 15–16. But&para;<br>this voluntary system has serious enforcement gaps.&para;<br>When California enacted its law, a Federal Trade Com­&para;<br>mission (FTC) study had found that nearly 70% of unac­&para;<br>companied 13- to 16-year-olds were able to buy M-rated&para;<br>video games. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to&para;<br>Children 27 (2004), online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2004/&para;<br>07/040708kidsviolencerpt.pdf. Subsequently the voluntary program has become more effective. But as of&para;<br>the FTC’s most recent update to Congress, 20% of those&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v. ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSN.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>under 17 are still able to buy M-rated video games, and,&para;<br>breaking down sales by store, one finds that this number rises to nearly 50% in the case of one large national&para;<br>chain. FTC, Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children 28 (2009), online at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2009/12/&para;<br>P994511violententertainment.pdf. And the industry could&para;<br>easily revert back to the substantial noncompliance that&para;<br>existed in 2004, particularly after today’s broad ruling&para;<br>reduces the industry’s incentive to police itself.&para;<br>The industry also argues for an alternative technological&para;<br>solution, namely “filtering at the console level.” Brief&para;<br>for Respondents 53. But it takes only a quick search of&para;<br>the Internet to find guides explaining how to circum­&para;<br>vent any such technological controls. YouTube viewers,&para;<br>for example, have watched one of those guides (called&para;<br>“How to bypass parental controls on the Xbox 360”) more&para;<br>than 47,000 times. See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=&para;<br>CFlVfVmvN6k.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The upshot is that California’s statute, as applied to its&para;<br>heartland of applications (i.e., buyers under 17; extremely&para;<br>violent, realistic video games), imposes a restriction on&para;<br>speech that is modest at most. That restriction is justified&para;<br>by a compelling interest (supplementing parents’ efforts to&para;<br>prevent their children from purchasing potentially harm­&para;<br>ful violent, interactive material). And there is no equally&para;<br>effective, less restrictive alternative. California’s statute&para;<br>is consequently constitutional on its face—though litigants&para;<br>remain free to challenge the statute as applied in particu­&para;<br>lar instances, including any effort by the State to apply it&para;<br>to minors aged 17.&para;<br>I add that the majority’s different conclusion creates a&para;<br>serious anomaly in First Amendment law. Ginsberg&para;<br>makes clear that a State can prohibit the sale to minors of&para;<br>depictions of nudity; today the Court makes clear that a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>State cannot prohibit the sale to minors of the most vio­&para;<br>lent interactive video games. But what sense does it make&para;<br>to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an&para;<br>image of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13­&para;<br>year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively,&para;<br>but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures&para;<br>and kills her? What kind of First Amendment would&para;<br>permit the government to protect children by restricting sales of that extremely violent video game only when&para;<br>the woman—bound, gagged, tortured, and killed—is also&para;<br>topless?&para;<br>This anomaly is not compelled by the First Amendment.&para;<br>It disappears once one recognizes that extreme violence,&para;<br>where interactive, and without literary, artistic, or similar&para;<br>justification, can prove at least as, if not more, harmful to&para;<br>children as photographs of nudity. And the record here is&para;<br>more than adequate to support such a view. That is why I&para;<br>believe that Ginsberg controls the outcome here a fortiori.&para;<br>And it is why I believe California’s law is constitutional on&para;<br>its face.&para;<br>This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is&para;<br>about education. Our Constitution cannot succeed in&para;<br>securing the liberties it seeks to protect unless we can&para;<br>raise future generations committed cooperatively to mak­&para;<br>ing our system of government work. Education, however,&para;<br>is about choices. Sometimes, children need to learn by&para;<br>making choices for themselves. Other times, choices are&para;<br>made for children—by their parents, by their teachers,&para;<br>and by the people acting democratically through their&para;<br>governments. In my view, the First Amendment does not&para;<br>disable government from helping parents make such a&para;<br>choice here—a choice not to have their children buy ex­&para;<br>tremely violent, interactive video games, which they more&para;<br>than reasonably fear pose only the risk of harm to those&para;<br>children.&para;<br>For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>BROWN v.
