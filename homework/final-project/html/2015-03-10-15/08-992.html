KINDLER&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–992.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued November 2, 2009—Decided December 8, 2009&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent Kindler was convicted of capital murder in Pennsylvania&para;<br>state court, and the jury recommended a death sentence. Kindler&para;<br>filed postverdict motions challenging his conviction and sentence, but&para;<br>before the trial court could consider the motions or the jury’s death&para;<br>recommendation, Kindler escaped and fled to Canada. The state trial&para;<br>court subsequently dismissed Kindler’s postverdict motions because&para;<br>of his escape. Canadian authorities ultimately captured Kindler and&para;<br>held him in jail pending extradition. But before Kindler could be&para;<br>transferred from Canadian custody, he escaped again, this time re&para;<br>maining at large for more than two years. He was eventually recap&para;<br>tured and transferred to the United States. Once back in this coun&para;<br>try, Kindler sought to reinstate his postverdict motions, but the trial&para;<br>court denied relief, holding that the judge who had dismissed the mo&para;<br>tions had not abused his discretion under Pennsylvania’s fugitive for&para;<br>feiture law. Kindler argued on direct appeal that the trial court&para;<br>erred in declining to address the merits of his postverdict motions,&para;<br>but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed. Kindler’s claims&para;<br>were rejected on state habeas, and he sought federal habeas relief.&para;<br>Under the adequate state ground doctrine, a federal habeas court will&para;<br>not review a claim rejected by a state court “if the decision of [the&para;<br>state] court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the&para;<br>federal question and adequate to support the judgment.” Coleman v.&para;<br>Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729. The District Court nonetheless&para;<br>granted Kindler’s habeas petition, determining that the state fugitive&para;<br>forfeiture rule did not provide an adequate basis to bar federal review&para;<br>of Kindler’s habeas claims. The Third Circuit affirmed, and the&para;<br>Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari. It argued that the Third&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BEARD v. KINDLER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Circuit had held the state fugitive forfeiture rule automatically in&para;<br>adequate because the state courts had discretion in applying it, and&para;<br>the Commonwealth sought review of that holding. The Court&para;<br>granted that petition.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: A state procedural rule is not automatically “inadequate” under&para;<br>the adequate state ground doctrine—and therefore unenforceable on&para;<br>federal habeas review—because the state rule is discretionary rather&para;<br>than mandatory. The question whether a state procedural ruling is&para;<br>adequate is itself a question of federal law. Lee v. Kemna, 534 U. S.&para;<br>362, 375. This Court has framed the adequacy inquiry by asking&para;<br>whether the state rule was “firmly established and regularly fol&para;<br>lowed.” Id., at 376. A discretionary state procedural rule can serve&para;<br>as an adequate ground to bar federal habeas review even if the ap&para;<br>propriate exercise of discretion may permit consideration of a federal&para;<br>claim in some cases but not others. A contrary holding would pose an&para;<br>unnecessary dilemma for the States: They could preserve flexibility&para;<br>by granting courts discretion to excuse procedural errors, but only at&para;<br>the cost of undermining the finality of state-court judgments. Or&para;<br>States could preserve the finality of their judgments by withholding&para;<br>such discretion, but only at the cost of precluding any flexibility in&para;<br>applying the rules. If forced to choose, many States would opt for&para;<br>mandatory rules to avoid the high costs of plenary federal review.&para;<br>That would be unfortunate in many cases, as discretionary rules are&para;<br>often desirable. The federal system, for example, often grants the&para;<br>trial judge broad discretion when his ringside perspective at the main&para;<br>event offers him a comparative advantage in decisionmaking. The&para;<br>States have followed suit. Given the federalism and comity concerns&para;<br>motivating the adequate state ground doctrine in the habeas context,&para;<br>see Coleman, supra, at 730, this Court should not disregard discre&para;<br>tionary state procedural rules that are in place in nearly every State&para;<br>and are substantially similar to those given full force in federal&para;<br>courts.

Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729 (1991). We granted&para;<br>certiorari to decide the following question: “Is a state&para;<br>procedural rule automatically ‘inadequate’ under the&para;<br>adequate-state-grounds doctrine—and therefore unen&para;<br>forceable on federal habeas corpus review—because the&para;<br>state rule is discretionary rather than mandatory?” Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. i. Petitioners argue the correct answer is “no.”&para;<br>At oral argument, respondent—consistent with his posi&para;<br>tion below—expressly agreed. We do too, and accordingly&para;<br>vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 1982, Joseph Kindler, along with Scott Shaw and&para;<br>David Bernstein, burglarized a music store in Bucks&para;<br>County, Pennsylvania. Police stopped the getaway car&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BEARD v. KINDLER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and arrested Shaw and Bernstein. In a harbinger of&para;<br>things to come, Kindler escaped. Commonwealth v. Kin&para;<br>dler, 536 Pa. 228, 236, 639 A. 2d 1, 5, cert. denied, 513&para;<br>U. S. 933 (1994).&para;<br>Police later arrested Kindler and charged him with&para;<br>burglary. He was released on bail. Bernstein agreed to&para;<br>testify against Kindler, but Kindler had other plans. At&para;<br>about 2:30 a.m. on July 25, 1982, Kindler and Shaw at&para;<br>tacked Bernstein outside his apartment. Kindler beat&para;<br>Bernstein with a baseball bat approximately 20 times, and&para;<br>Shaw shocked Bernstein 5 times with an electric prod.&para;<br>Bernstein at that point was still alive but unable to move,&para;<br>and Kindler and Shaw dragged their victim to their&para;<br>nearby car, loaded him in the trunk, and drove to the&para;<br>Delaware River. At the river, Kindler tied a cinder block&para;<br>around Bernstein’s neck and dumped him in the water. A&para;<br>forensic examiner later determined that Bernstein died of&para;<br>drowning and massive head injuries. 536 Pa., at 236–239,&para;<br>639 A. 2d, at 5–6.&para;<br>Kindler was brought to trial and convicted of capital&para;<br>murder. The jury recommended a death sentence, and&para;<br>Kindler filed postverdict motions. Id., at 230–231, 639&para;<br>A. 2d, at 2.&para;<br>But on September 19, 1984, before the trial court could&para;<br>consider the motions or the jury’s death recommendation,&para;<br>Kindler escaped. Ibid. In an organized effort to saw&para;<br>through the external prison bars with smuggled tools,&para;<br>Kindler broke out of the maximum-security wing of the&para;<br>prison and headed for Canada. See Commonwealth v.&para;<br>Kindler, 554 Pa. 513, 517–518, and n. 4, 722 A. 2d 143,&para;<br>145, and n. 4 (1998).&para;<br>Kindler remained a fugitive in Canada until April 26,&para;<br>1985, when he was arrested in Quebec for separate bur&para;<br>glary offenses. The United States sought Kindler’s return,&para;<br>but an extradition treaty allowed Canada to refuse to&para;<br>hand over anyone likely to face execution. See Kindler v.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Canada (Minister of Justice), [1991] 2 S. C. R. 779.&para;<br>Kindler turned into something of a local celebrity. He&para;<br>even appeared on Canadian television, explaining, among&para;<br>other things, how he had escaped and why he chose Can&para;<br>ada: “I knew there was no death penalty here.” CTV&para;<br>National News: Joseph Kindler’s Fate Unresolved (Cana&para;<br>dian television broadcast Sept. 22, 1985) (videos available&para;<br>in Clerk of Court’s case file). Canadian authorities ulti&para;<br>mately acquiesced to overtures from the United States and&para;<br>agreed to extradite Kindler. Kindler, supra, at 231, 639&para;<br>A. 2d, at 2.&para;<br>But before Kindler could be transferred from Canadian&para;<br>custody, he escaped again. On the night of October 23,&para;<br>1986, Kindler broke through a skylight on the 13th floor of&para;<br>the jail (his fellow inmates had hoisted him up to the&para;<br>skylight 15 feet above the floor) and escaped to the roof,&para;<br>where he stood 175 feet above ground. Armed with 13&para;<br>stories’ worth of bedsheets tied together, Kindler safely&para;<br>rappelled down the side of the jail. (A fellow escapee was&para;<br>not as lucky—the sheets ripped on his way down, causing&para;<br>him to fall 50 feet to his death.) Kindler, 554 Pa., at 517–&para;<br>519, 722 A. 2d, at 145.&para;<br>This time, Kindler remained on the lam for more than&para;<br>two years, until he was featured on the popular television&para;<br>show, “America’s Most Wanted.” Characterizing Kindler&para;<br>as “an above average criminal” and “a chess player who&para;<br>understands when to make his move,” the show asked&para;<br>viewers for information to help capture him. America’s&para;<br>Most Wanted, Sept. 4, 1988, Season 1, Episode 30, at&para;<br>10:01. Several viewers recognized Kindler and notified&para;<br>Canadian authorities, who arrested him in September&para;<br>1988. 554 Pa., at 519, 722 A. 2d, at 145.&para;<br>Kindler again fought extradition. On September 16,&para;<br>1991, after three years of litigation, the Supreme Court of&para;<br>Canada rejected Kindler’s efforts. See Kindler, 2 S. C. R.&para;<br>779. That same day, Canadian officials extradited Kindler&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BEARD v. KINDLER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to the United States. Kindler v. Horn, 291 F. Supp. 2d&para;<br>323, 334 (ED Pa. 2003).&para;<br>In the meantime, in 1984, the Pennsylvania trial court&para;<br>had dismissed Kindler’s postverdict motions because of his&para;<br>original escape. Once back in the United States, Kindler&para;<br>filed a motion to reinstate those challenges to his convic&para;<br>tion and sentence. The trial court denied the reinstate&para;<br>ment motion, holding that the trial court judge who had&para;<br>dismissed the postverdict motions in 1984 had not abused&para;<br>his discretion. In October 1991—more than seven years&para;<br>after the jury’s death recommendation—the court formally&para;<br>imposed the death sentence. Commonwealth v. Kindler,&para;<br>No. 2747 etc. (Pa. Ct. Common Pleas, Feb. 28, 1992), App.&para;<br>66–70.&para;<br>Kindler appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in&para;<br>declining to address the merits of his postverdict motions.&para;<br>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed. Kindler, 536&para;<br>Pa., at 232–234, 639 A. 2d, at 3. That court recognized&para;<br>that “trial courts, when faced with a defendant in fugitive&para;<br>status, . . . have every right to fashion an appropriate&para;<br>response[,] which can include the dismissal of pending&para;<br>post-verdict motions.” Id., at 233, 639 A. 2d, at 3. The&para;<br>court then determined that the trial court’s decision to&para;<br>dismiss Kindler’s claims fell within its authority: The&para;<br>“dismiss[al] [of] the post-verdict motions was a reasonable&para;<br>response to Appellant’s ‘flouting’ of the authority of the&para;<br>court.” Id., at 233–234, 639 A. 2d, at 3. Under Pennsyl&para;<br>vania’s fugitive forfeiture law, the court concluded, Kin&para;<br>dler’s case therefore came to it “without any allegations of&para;<br>error (direct or collateral) preserved.” Id., at 234, 639&para;<br>A. 2d, at 4.&para;<br>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court nonetheless con&para;<br>ducted the “limited review” mandated for death sentences&para;<br>under Pennsylvania law. Under that review, the court&para;<br>was required to confirm that the evidence was sufficient to&para;<br>support the conviction of first-degree murder and at least&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>one aggravating factor, and that the sentence was not&para;<br>excessive, disproportionate, or the product of passion or&para;<br>prejudice. Id., at 234–235, 639 A. 2d, at 4. Satisfied that&para;<br>Kindler’s conviction met these standards, the court af&para;<br>firmed his conviction and sentence. We denied certiorari.&para;<br>Kindler v. Pennsylvania, 513 U. S. 933 (1994).&para;<br>On state habeas, the Court of Common Pleas rejected&para;<br>Kindler’s claims. That court held that the Pennsylvania&para;<br>Supreme Court had already ruled that Kindler’s escape&para;<br>forfeited all claims challenging his conviction and sentence&para;<br>that Kindler may once have been entitled to bring. Com&para;<br>monwealth v. Kindler, No. 2747 etc. (July 23, 1997), App.&para;<br>183, 187–188. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed.&para;<br>Kindler, 554 Pa., at 514, 722 A. 2d, at 143.&para;<br>Kindler then sought federal habeas relief. The District&para;<br>Court determined that the fugitive forfeiture rule did not&para;<br>provide an adequate basis to bar federal review of Kin&para;<br>dler’s habeas claims. 291 F. Supp. 2d, at 340–343. The&para;<br>District Court then proceeded to address the merits,&para;<br>granting Kindler’s petition on the grounds that he was&para;<br>sentenced based on jury instructions that were unconsti&para;<br>tutional under Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988),&para;<br>and that the prosecutor improperly introduced an aggra&para;<br>vating factor at sentencing. 291 F. Supp. 2d, at 346–351,&para;<br>357–358. The court rejected Kindler’s ineffective assis&para;<br>tance of counsel claim. Id., at 356.&para;<br>The Third Circuit affirmed. That court began by recog&para;<br>nizing that “[a] procedural rule that is consistently applied&para;<br>in the vast majority of cases is adequate to bar federal&para;<br>habeas review even if state courts are willing to occasion&para;<br>ally overlook it and review the merits of a claim for relief&para;<br>where the rule would otherwise apply.” Kindler v. Horn,&para;<br>542 F. 3d 70, 79 (2008). The Court of Appeals then con&para;<br>sidered the Pennsylvania fugitive forfeiture rule in place&para;<br>at the time of Kindler’s first escape: “Pennsylvania courts&para;<br>had discretion to hear an appeal filed by a fugitive who&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BEARD v. KINDLER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>had been returned to custody before an appeal was initi&para;<br>ated or dismissed. . . . Accordingly, the fugitive forfeiture&para;<br>rule was not ‘firmly established’ and therefore was not an&para;<br>independent and adequate procedural rule sufficient to&para;<br>bar review of the merits of a habeas petition in federal&para;<br>court.” Ibid. (citing Doctor v. Walters, 96 F. 3d 675, 684–&para;<br>686 (CA3 1996)). The court thus determined that “the&para;<br>state trial court still had discretion to reinstate his post&para;<br>verdict motions. Accordingly, we conclude that, under&para;<br>Doctor, Pennsylvania’s fugitive waiver law did not pre&para;<br>clude the district court from reviewing the merits of the&para;<br>claims raised in Kindler’s habeas petition.” 542 F. 3d, at&para;<br>80. Turning to the merits, the Court of Appeals disagreed&para;<br>with the District Court on the improper aggravating factor&para;<br>claim, but held that Kindler was entitled to relief based on&para;<br>his Mills and ineffective assistance of counsel claims. 542&para;<br>F. 3d, at 80–87.&para;<br>The Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari, arguing&para;<br>that the Court of Appeals’ determination that state discre&para;<br>tionary rules are automatically inadequate conflicted with&para;<br>the holdings of other Courts of Appeals and warranted&para;<br>this Court’s review. Pet. for Cert. 6–11. Kindler coun&para;<br>tered that the Commonwealth had mischaracterized the&para;<br>Third Circuit’s holding. Relying on the court’s citation of&para;<br>the Doctor opinion, Kindler argued that the Third Circuit&para;<br>did not hold that discretionary state rules are automati&para;<br>cally inadequate; rather the court determined that the&para;<br>state courts applied “a new and different rule from that in&para;<br>existence at the time of the alleged default.” Brief in&para;<br>Opposition 3. It was that new rule, Kindler maintained,&para;<br>that the Third Circuit found inadequate. Ibid.&para;<br>We granted the Commonwealth’s petition for certiorari.&para;<br>556 U. S. ___ (2009). That petition asks us to decide&para;<br>whether discretionary procedural rulings are automati&para;<br>cally inadequate to bar federal court review on habeas.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009) &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>The question whether a state procedural ruling is ade&para;<br>quate is itself a question of federal law. Lee v. Kemna, 534&para;<br>U. S. 362, 375 (2002). We have framed the adequacy&para;<br>inquiry by asking whether the state rule in question was&para;<br>“ ‘firmly established and regularly followed.’ ” Id., at 376&para;<br>(quoting James v. Kentucky, 466 U. S. 341, 348 (1984)).&para;<br>We hold that a discretionary state procedural rule can&para;<br>serve as an adequate ground to bar federal habeas review.&para;<br>Nothing inherent in such a rule renders it inadequate for&para;<br>purposes of the adequate state ground doctrine. To the&para;<br>contrary, a discretionary rule can be “firmly established”&para;<br>and “regularly followed”—even if the appropriate exercise&para;<br>of discretion may permit consideration of a federal claim&para;<br>in some cases but not others. See Meltzer, State Court&para;<br>Forfeitures of Federal Rights, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 1128, 1140&para;<br>(1986) (“[R]efusals to exercise discretion do not form an&para;<br>important independent category under the inadequate&para;<br>state ground doctrine”).&para;<br>A contrary holding would pose an unnecessary dilemma&para;<br>for the States: States could preserve flexibility by granting&para;<br>courts discretion to excuse procedural errors, but only at&para;<br>the cost of undermining the finality of state court judg&para;<br>ments. Or States could preserve the finality of their&para;<br>judgments by withholding such discretion, but only at the&para;<br>cost of precluding any flexibility in applying the rules.&para;<br>We are told that, if forced to choose, many States would&para;<br>opt for mandatory rules to avoid the high costs that come&para;<br>with plenary federal review. See, e.g., Brief for State of&para;<br>California et al. as Amici Curiae 19; Brief for Criminal&para;<br>Justice Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae 14. That&para;<br>would be unfortunate in many cases, as discretionary&para;<br>rules are often desirable. In some circumstances, for&para;<br>example, the factors facing trial courts “are so numerous,&para;<br>variable and subtle that the fashioning of rigid rules&para;<br>would be more likely to impair [the trial judge’s] ability to&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BEARD v. KINDLER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>deal fairly with a particular problem than to lead to a just&para;<br>result.” United States v. McCoy, 517 F. 2d 41, 44 (CA7)&para;<br>(Stevens, J.), cert. denied, 423 U. S. 895 (1975); see also&para;<br>Friendly, Indiscretion About Discretion, 31 Emory L. J.&para;<br>747, 760–761 (1982). The result would be particularly&para;<br>unfortunate for criminal defendants, who would lose the&para;<br>opportunity to argue that a procedural default should be&para;<br>excused through the exercise of judicial discretion. See&para;<br>Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U. S. 443, 463, n. 3 (1965)&para;<br>(Harlan, J., dissenting) (“If, in order to insulate its deci&para;<br>sions from reversal by this Court, a state court must strip&para;<br>itself of the discretionary power to differentiate between&para;<br>different sets of circumstances, the [adequate state&para;<br>ground] rule operates in a most perverse way”).&para;<br>It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that the federal system&para;<br>often grants broad discretion to the trial judge when his&para;<br>ringside perspective at the “ ‘main event’ ” offers him a&para;<br>comparative advantage in decisionmaking. Wainwright v.&para;<br>Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 90 (1977); cf. United States v. Poynter,&para;<br>495 F. 3d 349, 351–352 (CA6 2007). The States seem to&para;<br>value discretionary rules as much as the Federal Govern&para;<br>ment does. See Brief for State of California et al. as Amici&para;<br>Curiae 16–17 (citing various state discretionary proce&para;<br>dural rules). In light of the federalism and comity con&para;<br>cerns that motivate the adequate state ground doctrine in&para;<br>the habeas context, see Coleman, 501 U. S., at 730, it&para;<br>would seem particularly strange to disregard state proce&para;<br>dural rules that are substantially similar to those to which&para;<br>we give full force in our own courts. Cf. Francis v. Hen&para;<br>derson, 425 U. S. 536, 541–542 (1976). Even stranger to&para;<br>do so with respect to rules in place in nearly every State,&para;<br>and all at one fell swoop.&para;<br>We take our holding in this case to be uncontroversial—&para;<br>so uncontroversial, in fact, that both parties agreed to the&para;<br>point before this Court. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29–31.&para;<br>Rather than defending the question on which we granted&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>certiorari—whether discretionary rules are automatically&para;<br>inadequate—Kindler argues that the Pennsylvania courts&para;<br>did not apply a discretionary rule at all, but instead ap&para;<br>plied a new rule mandating dismissal. Such a mandatory&para;<br>dismissal, Kindler contends, constituted a break from past&para;<br>discretionary practice, and thus does not provide an ade&para;<br>quate state ground to bar his federal claims. We leave it&para;<br>to the Court of Appeals to address that argument, and any&para;<br>others Kindler may have preserved, on remand.&para;<br>For its part, the Commonwealth urges us not only to&para;<br>reject a per se rule about discretionary rulings, but also to&para;<br>undertake “[a] new effort to state a standard for inade&para;<br>quacy.” Brief for Petitioners 25. Amici supporting the&para;<br>Commonwealth join in that request. See Brief for Crimi&para;<br>nal Justice Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae 6–10. We&para;<br>decline that invitation as well.

KINDLER &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[December 8, 2009] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,&para;<br>concurring.&para;<br>Due consideration of the phrasing in the question pre&para;<br>sented and of the arguments and concessions by counsel&para;<br>leads to the conclusion that this case should be vacated&para;<br>and remanded, and I join the Court’s opinion. The appar&para;<br>ent difficulty the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit&para;<br>found in accepting the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania’s&para;<br>procedural bar conclusion, however, invites this further&para;<br>comment.&para;<br>The adequate state ground doctrine cannot be applied&para;<br>without consideration of the purposes it is designed to&para;<br>serve. By refraining from deciding cases that rest on an&para;<br>adequate and independent state ground, federal courts&para;<br>show proper respect for state courts and avoid rendering&para;<br>advisory opinions. Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040&para;<br>(1983). The claimed adequate and independent state&para;<br>ground at issue in this case is a state procedural rule. We&para;<br>have not allowed state courts to bar review of federal&para;<br>claims by invoking new procedural rules without adequate&para;<br>notice to litigants who, in asserting their federal rights,&para;<br>have in good faith complied with existing state procedural&para;<br>law. “Novelty in procedural requirements cannot be per&para;<br>mitted to thwart review in this Court applied for by those&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BEARD v. KINDLER&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>who, in justified reliance upon prior decisions, seek vindi&para;<br>cation in state courts of their federal constitutional&para;<br>rights.” NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S.&para;<br>449, 457–458 (1958). We have also been mindful of the&para;<br>danger that novel state procedural requirements will be&para;<br>imposed for the purpose of evading compliance with a&para;<br>federal standard. See, e.g., NAACP v. Alabama ex rel.&para;<br>Flowers, 377 U. S. 288, 293–302 (1964).&para;<br>Neither of these concerns applies here. First, no one&para;<br>could seriously entertain the notion that Kindler acted in&para;<br>“justified reliance” when he fled beyond the jurisdiction of&para;<br>the Pennsylvania courts. Even if a hypothetical escapee&para;<br>studiously examined the case law before making an in&para;<br>formed decision that flight was worth it, that is not the&para;<br>reliance the law should be required to consider. There is&para;<br>no justification for an unlawful escape, which “operates as&para;<br>an affront to the dignity of [a] court’s proceedings.” Or&para;<br>tega-Rodriguez v. United States, 507 U. S. 234, 246 (1993).&para;<br>And if some prior court rulings allowed a former escapee&para;<br>to reinstate forfeited claims, there is no convincing reason&para;<br>to say a future escapee is entitled to similar treatment.&para;<br>Nor is there any indication that the Supreme Court of&para;<br>Pennsylvania adopted its forfeiture rule out of any hostil&para;<br>ity toward legitimate constitutional claims.&para;<br>It is most doubtful that, in light of its underlying pur&para;<br>poses, the adequate state ground doctrine ought to prevent&para;<br>a State from adopting, and enforcing, a sensible rule that&para;<br>the escaped felon forfeits any pending postverdict motions.&para;<br>The law is entitled to protect the regularity and predict&para;<br>ability of its own processes, and its own interest in the&para;<br>prompt adjudication of disputed issues, by imposing a rule&para;<br>of waiver quite without regard to some notion of express or&para;<br>constructive reliance by the one who escapes. And if that&para;<br>principle had not been fully explicated in prior decisions, it&para;<br>seems to me that the State can establish a new baseline&para;<br>without later having its procedural bar ignored by the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>federal courts. This should be true even if the principles&para;<br>barring the postverdict motions are first elaborated in the&para;<br>instant case.&para;<br>The process of elaborating, defining, and then shaping a&para;<br>State’s decisional law after considering the competing&para;<br>arguments in a specific case rests on this premise: Novel&para;<br>facts and circumstances may disclose principles that,&para;<br>while consistent with the logic and rationality the law&para;<br>seeks and in that sense predictable, still have not yet been&para;<br>defined with precision in earlier cases. This is the dy&para;<br>namic of the case system we rely upon to explain the law.&para;<br>The adequate state ground doctrine ought not to fore&para;<br>close the case process in the separate States. A too&para;<br>rigorous or demanding insistence that procedural re&para;<br>quirements be established in all of their detail before they&para;<br>can be given effect in federal court would deprive the&para;<br>States of the case law decisional dynamic that the Judici&para;<br>ary of the United States finds necessary and appropriate&para;<br>for the elaboration of its own procedural rules. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Smith v. United States, 94 U. S. 97 (1876). Save where&para;<br>there is exclusive jurisdiction or federal supremacy, a&para;<br>proper constitutional balance ought not give federal courts&para;<br>latitude in the interpretation and elaboration of its law&para;<br>that it then withholds from the States. There is no sense&para;<br>in applying the adequate state ground rule without its&para;<br>being informed by these principles.&para;<br>Whether the structure of this case either permits or&para;<br>requires consideration of these matters is not clear at this&para;<br>stage. In a proper case, however, these concerns should be&para;<br>addressed. It seems most doubtful that this Court can or&para;<br>should require federal courts to disregard a state proce&para;<br>dural ground that was not in all respects explicit before&para;<br>the case when it was first announced, absent a showing of&para;<br>a purpose or pattern to evade constitutional guarantees.&para;<br>And this is particularly so when the state procedural&para;<br>requirement arose from the necessity, in new circum&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BEARD v. KINDLER&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>stances, to prevent a travesty of the State’s own respected&para;<br>system. In this context, the objecting party ought not to&para;<br>have the power to block federal courts from honoring&para;<br>state-law determinations that were otherwise valid, en&para;<br>forceable, and consistent with constitutional guarantees.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
