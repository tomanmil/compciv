Decided January 19, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>From beginning to end, judicial proceedings conducted&para;<br>for the purpose of deciding whether a defendant shall be&para;<br>put to death must be conducted with dignity and respect.&para;<br>The disturbing facts of this case raise serious questions&para;<br>concerning the conduct of the trial, and this petition raises&para;<br>a serious question about whether the Court of Appeals&para;<br>carefully reviewed those facts before addressing peti&para;<br>tioner’s constitutional claims. We know that the Court of&para;<br>Appeals committed the same procedural error that we&para;<br>corrected in Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op.,&para;<br>at 17–18). We do not know how the court would have&para;<br>ruled if it had the benefit of our decision in that case.&para;<br>Petitioner Marcus Wellons was convicted in Georgia&para;<br>state court of rape and murder and sentenced to death.&para;<br>Although the trial looked typical, there were unusual&para;<br>events going on behind the scenes. Only after the trial did&para;<br>defense counsel learn that there had been unreported ex&para;<br>parte contacts between the jury and the judge, that jurors&para;<br>and a bailiff had planned a reunion, and that “either&para;<br>during or immediately following the penalty phase, some&para;<br>jury members gave the trial judge chocolate shaped as&para;<br>male genitalia and the bailiff chocolate shaped as female&para;<br>breasts,” 554 F. 3d 923, 930 (CA11 2009). The judge had&para;<br>not reported any of this to the defense.&para;<br>Neither Wellons nor any court has ascertained exactly&para;<br>what went on at this capital trial or what prompted such&para;<br>“gifts.” Wellons has repeatedly tried, in both state and&para;<br>federal court, to find out what occurred, but he has found&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WELLONS v. HALL&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>himself caught in a procedural morass: He raised the issue&para;<br>on direct appeal but was constrained by the nonexistent&para;<br>record, and the State Supreme Court affirmed his convic&para;<br>tion and sentence. Wellons v. State, 266 Ga. 77, 88, 463&para;<br>S. E. 2d 868, 880 (1995). He sought state habeas relief&para;<br>and moved to develop evidence. But the court held that&para;<br>the matter had been decided on appeal and thus was res&para;<br>judicata. See 554 F. 3d, at 932. He raised the issue again&para;<br>in his federal habeas petition, seeking discovery and an&para;<br>evidentiary hearing. But the District Court “concluded&para;<br>that Wellons’ claims . . . were procedurally barred, and&para;<br>accordingly denied his motion for an evidentiary hearing&para;<br>on these claims.” Id., at 933.1 Before the Eleventh Cir&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Although the District Court found most of petitioner’s claims to be&para;<br>procedurally barred, it alternatively declined to permit an evidentiary&para;<br>hearing because Wellons did not have enough evidence of bias or&para;<br>misconduct. JUSTICE ALITO wrongly suggests that the District Court&para;<br>reached that conclusion by reviewing a proffer that Wellons’ attorneys&para;<br>assembled by “contacting all but 1 of the jurors,” many of whom “spoke&para;<br>freely.” Post, at 2 (dissenting opinion). Even apart from the fact that&para;<br>these interviews were informal and unsworn, they shed almost no light&para;<br>on what had occurred. The juror who allegedly “gave the penis to the&para;<br>judge,” App. C to Pet. for Cert. 36, was “hostile and refused to talk,” id.,&para;<br>at 37; one “refused to talk about the trial,” id., at 36; another “did not&para;<br>want to talk about the case,” id., at 37; and one “conferr[ed]” with his&para;<br>wife who then “slammed and bolted the door,” ibid. Of those jurors who&para;<br>were willing to talk at all, one admitted to being “concerned that she&para;<br>might say something that would be used for a mistrial,” id., at 35, and&para;<br>none admitted to knowing how or why the jury selected its “gifts,” see&para;<br>id., at 35–36, 37. (Implausibly, JUSTICE ALITO suggests that Wellons’&para;<br>lawyers may not have asked how or why the jury selected its “gifts,”&para;<br>post, at 3, though he bases that speculation only on the fact that no&para;<br>questions appeared in the proffer of facts.) Rather, the jurors discussed&para;<br>other matters and did so in the briefest of terms. All told, “everything&para;<br>that Petitioner . . . learned,” App. C to Pet. for Cert. 38, filled only a few&para;<br>sheets of paper, see id., at 35–36, 37.&para;<br>Moreover, the subjects that the jurors did discuss may very well sup&para;<br>port Wellons’ view that his trial was tainted by bias or misconduct. For&para;<br>example, one interviewee “was surprised” that a fellow juror had been&para;<br>allowed to serve on a capital trial, given that her sister had been&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>cuit, Wellons “argue[d] that the district court erred in&para;<br>denying his motions for discovery and an evidentiary&para;<br>hearing to develop his judge, juror, and bailiff misconduct&para;<br>claims because they are not procedurally barred.” Id., at&para;<br>935. The court disagreed, holding that Wellons’ claims&para;<br>were procedurally barred. Ibid.&para;<br>As our dissenting colleagues acknowledge, post, at 1&para;<br>(opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 1 (opinion of ALITO, J.), the&para;<br>Eleventh Circuit’s holding was an error under Cone, 556&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17–18). “When a state court&para;<br>declines to review the merits of a petitioner’s claim on the&para;<br>ground that it has done so already, it creates no bar to&para;<br>federal habeas review.” Id., at __ (slip op., at 17). Both&para;<br>dissenting opinions assume that “the issue on which Cone&para;<br>throws light does not affect the outcome” because “the&para;<br>Eleventh Circuit . . . also decided that petitioner was not&para;<br>entitled to habeas relief on the merits.” Post, at 1–2 (opin&para;<br>ion of SCALIA, J.). Having found a procedural bar, how&para;<br>ever, the Eleventh Circuit had no need to address whether&para;<br>petitioner was otherwise entitled to an evidentiary hear&para;<br>ing and gave this question, at most, perfunctory considera&para;<br>tion that may well have turned on the District Court’s&para;<br>finding of a procedural bar.&para;<br>Although Wellons appealed the denial of “his motions&para;<br>for discovery and an evidentiary hearing,” 554 F. 3d, at&para;<br>935, the Eleventh Circuit did not purport to address the&para;<br>merits of that issue at all.2 The court stated only that&para;<br>“[e]ven if we assume that Wellons’s misconduct claims are&para;<br>not procedurally barred, they do not entitle Wellons to&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>murdered by a man after he completed serving a life sentence. Id., at &para;<br>&para;<br>36.&para;<br>2 As JUSTICE ALITO explains at some length, see post, at 2–4, the Dis&para;<br>trict Court did discuss the merits of that issue, but the District Court’s&para;<br>analysis has little relevance on whether the Court of Appeals made an&para;<br>alternative holding or rather affirmed the District Court’s decision on&para;<br>the ground that petitioner’s claim was procedurally barred.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>WELLONS v. HALL&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>habeas relief.” Id., at 936 (emphasis added). This opaque&para;<br>statement appears to address only whether petitioner was&para;<br>entitled to ultimate relief in the form of a new trial, not&para;<br>whether petitioner’s allegations, combined with the facts&para;<br>he had learned, entitled him to the discovery and eviden&para;<br>tiary hearing that he sought.&para;<br>The Eleventh Circuit’s reasoning does not suggest oth&para;<br>erwise. The court observed that Wellons’ claims of mis&para;<br>conduct were “grounded in his speculation as to the mean&para;<br>ing underlying the jurors’ chocolate ‘gifts’ ” and “the&para;<br>surmise attached to their passive receipt of these gifts.”&para;<br>Ibid. This statement likewise indicates only that on the&para;<br>existing record, habeas relief was inappropriate, not that&para;<br>an evidentiary hearing should be denied. After all, had&para;<br>there been discovery or an evidentiary hearing, Wellons&para;<br>may have been able to present more than “speculation”&para;<br>and “surmise.” The Eleventh Circuit also pointed to the&para;<br>state court’s decision on direct appeal, see id., at 937, and&para;<br>reviewed that decision “[i]n light of the evidence presented&para;<br>before the Georgia Supreme Court,” ibid. This, too, is&para;<br>typical of a court reviewing the denial of habeas relief, not&para;<br>the denial of discovery or an evidentiary hearing. 3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 JUSTICE ALITO asserts that the Eleventh Circuit “stated in unequivo&para;<br>cal terms that its holding on the merits of petitioner’s claim was inde&para;<br>pendent of its holding on the question of procedural default.” Post, at 1.&para;<br>But that does not address the question: The merits of what? The&para;<br>question whether to grant habeas relief or whether to permit discovery&para;<br>and an evidentiary hearing?&para;<br>Contrary to our dissenting colleagues, post, at 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.),&para;<br>we do not find it dispositive that the section of the Eleventh Circuit’s&para;<br>opinion about judge, juror, and bailiff misconduct began with a full&para;<br>page statement of the standard of review, which in turn included a&para;<br>sentence about the circumstances under which an evidentiary hearing&para;<br>is warranted. See 554 F. 3d, at 934–935. Immediately following the&para;<br>standard of review that JUSTICE ALITO quotes, the panel explained that&para;<br>“ ‘if the record . . . precludes habeas relief, a district court is not re&para;<br>quired to hold an evidentiary hearing,’ ” and that “the record reveals&para;<br>that [Wellons’] claims . . . are procedurally barred.” Id., at 935.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Moreover, even assuming that the Eleventh Circuit&para;<br>intended to address Wellons’ motions for discovery and an&para;<br>evidentiary hearing, we cannot be sure that its reasoning&para;<br>really was independent of the Cone error. The fact that&para;<br>his claims rested on “speculation” and “surmise” was due&para;<br>to the absence of a record, which was in part based on the&para;<br>Cone error. And as the Eleventh Circuit’s reasoning&para;<br>turned on “the evidence presented before the Georgia&para;<br>Supreme Court,” 554 F. 3d, at 937, there is serious doubt&para;<br>about whether it necessarily relied on the very holes in the&para;<br>record that Wellons was trying to fill.&para;<br>Our dissenting colleagues allege that the Court is “de&para;<br>grad[ing] . . . our traditional requirements for a GVR.”&para;<br>Post, at 2 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); see post, at 4 (opinion of&para;<br>ALITO, J.). But the standard for an order granting certio&para;<br>rari, vacating the judgment below, and remanding the&para;<br>case (GVR) remains as it always has been: A GVR is ap&para;<br>propriate when “intervening developments . . . reveal a&para;<br>reasonable probability that the decision below rests upon a&para;<br>premise that the lower court would reject if given the&para;<br>opportunity for further consideration, and where it ap&para;<br>pears that such a redetermination may determine the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Moreover, the allegedly “unequivocal” holding that JUSTICE ALITO&para;<br>quotes was preceded by a discussion of the deference owed under the&para;<br>Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) to the&para;<br>“Georgia Supreme Court’s judgment as to the substance and effect of&para;<br>the ex parte communication.” Id., at 937. This is the classic formula&para;<br>tion of a decision of whether to grant habeas relief. Indeed, it would be&para;<br>bizarre if a federal court had to defer to state-court factual findings,&para;<br>made without any evidentiary record, in order to decide whether it&para;<br>could create an evidentiary record to decide whether the factual find&para;<br>ings were erroneous. If that were the case, then almost no habeas&para;<br>petitioner could ever get an evidentiary hearing: So long as the state&para;<br>court found a fact that the petitioner was trying to disprove through the&para;<br>presentation of evidence, then there could be no hearing. AEDPA does&para;<br>not require such a crabbed and illogical approach to habeas procedures,&para;<br>and there is no reason to believe that the Eleventh Circuit thought&para;<br>otherwise.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>WELLONS v. HALL&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>ultimate outcome” of the matter. Lawrence v. Chater, 516&para;<br>U. S. 163, 167 (1996) (per curiam). As already discussed,&para;<br>there is, at least, a “reasonable probability,” ibid., that the&para;<br>denial of discovery and an evidentiary hearing rested in&para;<br>part on the Cone error. And in light of the unusual facts of&para;<br>the case, a “redetermination may determine the ultimate&para;<br>outcome,” 516 U. S., at 167; cf. Williams v. Taylor, 529&para;<br>U. S. 420, 442 (2000) (holding that several “omissions as a&para;<br>whole disclose the need for an evidentiary hearing”);&para;<br>Smith v. Phillips, 455 U. S. 209, 215 (1982) (“This Court&para;<br>has long held that the remedy for allegations of juror&para;<br>partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has an&para;<br>opportunity to prove actual bias”). The Eleventh Circuit’s&para;<br>opinion is ambiguous in significant respects. It would be&para;<br>highly inappropriate to assume away that ambiguity in&para;<br>respondent’s favor. That is especially so in a case in which&para;<br>petitioner’s allegations and the unusual facts raise a&para;<br>serious question about the fairness of a capital trial.&para;<br>Both dissenting opinions suggest that if there is a strong&para;<br>case for discovery and an evidentiary hearing, then the&para;<br>Court “should summarily reverse or set the case for argu&para;<br>ment.” Post, at 2 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); see also post, at&para;<br>4–5 (opinion of ALITO, J.). But as we have explained, “a&para;<br>GVR order conserves the scarce resources of this Court,”&para;<br>“assists the court below by flagging a particular issue that&para;<br>it does not appear to have fully considered,” and “assists&para;<br>this Court by procuring the benefit of the lower court’s&para;<br>insight before we rule on the merits.” Lawrence, supra, at&para;<br>167.&para;<br>Unlike JUSTICE SCALIA, post, at 3, we do not believe that&para;<br>a “self-respecting” court of appeals would or should re&para;<br>spond to our remand order with a “summary reissuance”&para;<br>of essentially the same opinion, absent the procedural&para;<br>default discussion. To the contrary, in light of our decision&para;<br>in Cone, we assume the court will consider, on the merits,&para;<br>whether petitioner’s allegations, together with the undis&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

S. C. §2254. Wellons claims, among&para;<br>other things, that misconduct on the part of the trial&para;<br>judge, jurors, and court bailiff deprived him of a fair trial.&para;<br>The District Court denied relief, and the Eleventh Circuit&para;<br>affirmed.&para;<br>Today the Court grants Wellons’ petition for certiorari,&para;<br>vacates the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit, and re&para;<br>mands (“GVRs”) in light of Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___&para;<br>(2009). The Eleventh Circuit concluded that Wellons’&para;<br>claims were procedurally barred because the state post&para;<br>conviction court, noting that the State Supreme Court had&para;<br>rejected them on direct appeal, held the claims were res&para;<br>judicata. See 554 F. 3d 923, 936, and n. 6 (2009). This&para;<br>was error under Cone, see 556 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 17–18), as respondent recognizes; indeed, the Eleventh&para;<br>Circuit has already recognized the abrogation of the opin&para;<br>ion below on this point, see Owen v. Secretary for Dept. of&para;<br>Corrections, 568 F. 3d 894, 915, n. 23, (2009). But, as&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO’s dissent demonstrates, post, p. ___, the&para;<br>Eleventh Circuit (like the District Court) also decided that&para;<br>petitioner was not entitled to habeas relief on the merits.&para;<br>554 F. 3d, at 936–938. Thus the Court GVRs in light of&para;<br>Cone even though the issue on which Cone throws light&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WELLONS v. HALL&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>does not affect the outcome.&para;<br>The Court has previously asserted a power to GVR&para;<br>whenever there is “a reasonable probability that the deci&para;<br>sion below rests upon a premise that the lower court&para;<br>would reject if given the opportunity for further considera&para;<br>tion, and where it appears that such a redetermination&para;<br>may determine the ultimate outcome of the litigation.”&para;<br>Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U. S. 163, 167 (1996) (per cu&para;<br>riam). I have protested even that flabby standard, see id.,&para;<br>at 190–191 (SCALIA, J., dissenting), but today the Court&para;<br>outdoes itself. It GVRs where the decision below does not&para;<br>“rest upon” the objectionable faulty premise, but is inde&para;<br>pendently supported by other grounds—so that redeter&para;<br>mination of the faulty ground will assuredly not “deter&para;<br>mine the ultimate outcome of the litigation.” The power to&para;<br>“revise and correct for error,” which the Court has already&para;<br>turned into “a power to void for suspicion,” id., at 190&para;<br>(same) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted),&para;<br>has now become the power to send back for a re-do. We&para;<br>have no authority to decree that. If the Court thinks that&para;<br>the Eleventh Circuit’s merits holding is wrong, then it&para;<br>should summarily reverse or set the case for argument;&para;<br>otherwise, the judgment below must stand. The same is&para;<br>true if (as the Court evidently believes) the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals should have required an evidentiary hearing before&para;<br>resolving the merits question. If they erred in that regard&para;<br>their judgment should be reversed rather than remanded&para;<br>“in light of Cone v. Bell”—a disposition providing no hint&para;<br>that what we really want them to do (as the Court be&para;<br>lieves) is to consider an evidentiary hearing.&para;<br>The systematic degradation of our traditional require&para;<br>ments for a GVR has spawned a series of unusual disposi&para;<br>tions, including the GVR so the government can try a less&para;<br>extravagant argument on remand, see Department of&para;<br>Interior v. South Dakota, 519 U. S. 919, 921 (1996)&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., dissenting), the GVR in light of nothing, see&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

An appropriately self-respecting&para;<br>response to today’s summary vacatur would be summary&para;<br>reissuance of the same opinion, minus the discussion of&para;<br>Cone.

Decided January 19, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins,&para;<br>dissenting.&para;<br>The Court’s disposition of this case represents a misuse&para;<br>of our authority to grant, vacate, and remand (GVR). The&para;<br>decision of the Court of Appeals plainly rests on two inde&para;<br>pendent grounds: first, that petitioner procedurally de&para;<br>faulted his claim that the judge, bailiff, and jurors had an&para;<br>inappropriate relationship that impaired his right to a fair&para;<br>trial and, second, that petitioner’s claim failed on the&para;<br>merits. See 554 F. 3d 923, 936 (CA11 2009). While it is&para;<br>true that the first of these grounds is inconsistent with&para;<br>Cone v. Bell, 556 U. S. ___ , ___ (2009) (slip op., at 17–18),&para;<br>there is no basis for vacating the decision below unless&para;<br>some recent authority or development provides a basis for&para;<br>reconsideration of the second ground as well. But the per&para;<br>curiam identifies no such authority. Instead, the per&para;<br>curiam uses Cone as a vehicle for suggesting that the&para;<br>Court of Appeals should reconsider its decision on the&para;<br>merits of petitioner’s claim.&para;<br>In order to defend this disposition, the per curiam re&para;<br>fuses to credit the Court of Appeals’ explanation of the&para;<br>basis of its decision. The Court of Appeals twice stated in&para;<br>unequivocal terms that its holding on the merits of peti&para;<br>tioner’s claim was independent of its holding on the ques&para;<br>tion of procedural default. See 554 F. 3d, at 937–938&para;<br>(“[E]ven if these claims were properly before us on habeas&para;<br>review, we would not disturb the Georgia Supreme Court’s&para;<br>conclusion on the merits of these claims”); id., at 936&para;<br>(“Even if we assume that Wellons’s misconduct claims are&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WELLONS v.

But the per curiam states that the Court&para;<br>of Appeals’ consideration of the merits “may well have&para;<br>turned on the District Court’s finding of a procedural bar”&para;<br>and that “we cannot be sure that [the panel’s] reasoning&para;<br>really was independent of the Cone error.” Ante, at 3, 5.&para;<br>Even worse, the per curiam unjustifiably suggests that&para;<br>the Court of Appeals gave at most only “perfunctory con&para;<br>sideration” to petitioner’s claim that he was entitled to an&para;<br>evidentiary hearing and may not have “carefully reviewed”&para;<br>the relevant facts.

Interestingly, the&para;<br>proffer does not reflect that the attorneys asked any of the&para;<br>jurors what would appear to be the most critical question,&para;<br>namely, why the strange gifts were given to the judge or&para;<br>the bailiff.3 See App. C to Pet. for Cert. 34–38. If any such&para;<br>questions had been asked and answers favorable to peti&para;<br>tioner’s position had been provided, one would expect that&para;<br>information to appear in the proffer.&para;<br>After examining the proffer made by petitioner’s attor&para;<br>neys, the District Court concluded that this submission&para;<br>did not justify formal discovery. With respect to what the&para;<br>per curiam describes as the “unreported ex parte contacts&para;<br>between the jury and the judge,” ante, at 1—which appar&para;<br>ently consisted of a brief exchange of words that occurred&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The&para;<br>&para;<br>per curiam assumes that the jurors who were interviewed must&para;<br>have spoken only “in the briefest of terms” because “ ‘everything that&para;<br>Petitioner. . . learned’ ” “filled only a few sheets of paper.” Ibid. The&para;<br>mere fact that the unsworn proffer submitted by petitioner’s state&para;<br>habeas counsel consisted of four pages, see App. C to Pet. for Cert. 35–&para;<br>38, does not seem to me to provide a sufficient basis for concluding that&para;<br>the jurors interviewed spoke only “in the briefest of terms.” The length&para;<br>of the proffer is equally consistent with the possibility that the jurors&para;<br>interviewed spoke at length but did not supply information that peti&para;<br>tioner’s counsel deemed helpful to his case.&para;<br>3 The main reason for the interviews was to inquire about the gifts,&para;<br>and the proffer shows that the jurors who were interviewed discussed&para;<br>this matter. See, e.g., App. C to Pet. for Cert. 35 (a juror “stated that&para;<br>‘we,’ the jurors gave a pair of chocolate breasts to the bailiff and the&para;<br>chocolate penis just followed”); ibid. (a juror “stated that some of the&para;<br>jurors decided to send a pair of edible chocolate breasts to one of the&para;<br>female bailiffs and an edible chocolate penis to the trial judge”); id., at&para;<br>37 (a juror “remembered discussion about giving a chocolate penis to&para;<br>the judge”). Nevertheless, petitioner’s proffer includes no information&para;<br>as to why the gifts were given—not even a statement to the effect that&para;<br>the jurors interviewed were asked this question and said that they did&para;<br>not know. Cf. id., at 35 (noting that a particular juror “did not know&para;<br>whose idea it was to send the chocolate penis to the judge,” but not&para;<br>including any representation as to her understanding of why the gifts&para;<br>may have been given (emphasis added)).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>WELLONS v. HALL&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>when the judge entered the room in a restaurant where&para;<br>the jurors were dining—the District Court concluded that&para;<br>“nothing that Petitioner has presented provides even the&para;<br>slightest indication that anything more than a simple&para;<br>greeting occurred,” App. C to Pet. for Cert. 43.&para;<br>With respect to the gifts that were given to the judge&para;<br>and a bailiff after the trial ended, the District Court&para;<br>stressed that they were “inappropriate” and represented&para;<br>“an unusual display of poor taste in the context of a pro&para;<br>ceeding so grave as a capital trial,” ibid., but the Court&para;<br>noted that petitioner had not proffered any evidence that&para;<br>any of the jurors or court personnel who were interviewed&para;<br>had said anything that substantiated the assertion that&para;<br>“an inappropriate relationship existed between the judge,&para;<br>the bailiff, and the jury,” id., at 44.&para;<br>A fair reading of the Court of Appeals’ opinion is that&para;<br>that court likewise held that petitioner was not entitled to&para;<br>the discovery he sought because that discovery was&para;<br>unlikely to yield evidence substantiating his claim. See&para;<br>554 F. 3d, at 935 (quoting Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S.&para;<br>465, 474 (2007) (“When deciding whether to grant a fed&para;<br>eral habeas petitioner’s request for an evidentiary hear&para;<br>ing, ‘a federal court must consider whether such a hearing&para;<br>could enable an applicant to prove the petition’s factual&para;<br>allegations, which, if true, would entitle the applicant to&para;<br>federal habeas relief’ ”)).&para;<br>I agree with the Court that the strange and tasteless&para;<br>gifts that were given to the trial judge and bailiff are&para;<br>facially troubling, and I am certainly not prepared at this&para;<br>point to say that the decision below on the discovery issue&para;<br>was correct. But unlike the Court, I do not think it is&para;<br>proper for us to use a GVR to address this matter. The&para;<br>lower courts have decided the discovery issue, and now&para;<br>this Court has two options. First, if we wish to review the&para;<br>question whether petitioner made a sufficient showing to&para;<br>justify interrogation of the jurors, we should grant the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>petition for a writ of certiorari and decide that question.&para;<br>Second, if we do not wish to tackle that fact-bound ques&para;<br>tion, we should deny review or GVR in light of a recent&para;<br>authority or development that casts doubt on the judg&para;<br>ment of the court below. What the Court has done—using&para;<br>a GVR as a vehicle for urging the Court of Appeals to&para;<br>reconsider its holding on a question that is entirely inde&para;<br>pendent of the ground for the GVR—is extraordinary and,&para;<br>in my view, improper.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
