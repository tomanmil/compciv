Lexmark’s “Prebate” program gives customers a discount on new cartridges if they agree to&para;<br>return empty cartridges to the company. Each Prebate cartridge has&para;<br>a microchip that disables the empty cartridge unless Lexmark replaces the chip. Respondent Static Control, a maker and seller of&para;<br>components for the remanufacture of Lexmark cartridges, developed&para;<br>a microchip that mimicked Lexmark’s. Lexmark sued for copyright&para;<br>infringement, but Static Control counterclaimed, alleging that&para;<br>Lexmark engaged in false or misleading advertising in violation of&para;<br>§43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U. S. C. §1125(a), and that its misrepresentations had caused Static Control lost sales and damage to its&para;<br>business reputation. The District Court held that Static Control&para;<br>lacked “prudential standing” to bring the Lanham Act claim, applying a multifactor balancing test the court attributed to Associated&para;<br>Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S. 519. In reversing, the Sixth Circuit relied on the Second Circuit’s “reasonable interest” test.&para;<br>Held: Static Control has adequately pleaded the elements of a Lanham&para;<br>Act cause of action for false advertising. Pp. 6–22.&para;<br>(a) The question here is whether Static Control falls within the&para;<br>class of plaintiffs that Congress authorized to sue under §1125(a). To&para;<br>decide that question, this Court must determine the provision’s&para;<br>meaning, using traditional principles of statutory interpretation. It&para;<br>is misleading to label this a “prudential standing” question. Lexmark&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LEXMARK INT’L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL &para;<br>&para;<br>COMPONENTS, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>bases its “prudential standing” arguments on Associated General&para;<br>Contractors, but that case rested on statutory considerations: The&para;<br>Court sought to “ascertain,” as a statutory-interpretation matter, the&para;<br>“scope of the private remedy created by” Congress in §4 of the Clayton Act, and the “class of persons who [could] maintain a private&para;<br>damages action under” that legislatively conferred cause of action,&para;<br>459 U. S., at 529, 532. And while this Court may have placed the&para;<br>“zone of interests” test that Static Control relies on under the “prudential” rubric in the past, see, e.g., Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v.&para;<br>Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 12, it does not belong there any more than Associated General Contractors does. Rather, whether a plaintiff comes&para;<br>within the zone of interests requires the Court to determine, using&para;<br>traditional statutory-interpretation tools, whether a legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff ’s claim.&para;<br>See, e. g., Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83,&para;<br>97, and n. 2. Pp. 6–9.&para;<br>(b) The §1125(a) cause of action extends to plaintiffs who fall within the zone of interests protected by that statute and whose injury&para;<br>was proximately caused by a violation of that statute. Pp. 10–18.&para;<br>(1) A statutory cause of action is presumed to extend only to&para;<br>plaintiffs whose interests “fall within the zone of interests protected&para;<br>by the law invoked.” Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751. “[T]he&para;<br>breadth of [that] zone . . . varies according to the provisions of law at&para;<br>issue.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 163. The Lanham Act includes a detailed statement of its purposes, including, as relevant&para;<br>here, “protect[ing] persons engaged in [commerce within the control&para;<br>of Congress] against unfair competition,” 15 U. S. C. §1127; and “unfair competition” was understood at common law to be concerned&para;<br>with injuries to business reputation and present and future sales.&para;<br>Thus, to come within the zone of interests in a §1125(a) falseadvertising suit, a plaintiff must allege an injury to a commercial interest in reputation or sales. Pp. 10–13.&para;<br>(2) A statutory cause of action is also presumed to be limited to&para;<br>plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the&para;<br>statute. See, e.g., Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 268–270. This requirement generally bars suits&para;<br>for alleged harm that is “too remote” from the defendant’s unlawful&para;<br>conduct, such as when the harm is purely derivative of “misfortunes&para;<br>visited upon a third person by the defendant’s acts.” Id., at 268–269.&para;<br>In a sense, all commercial injuries from false advertising are derivative of those suffered by consumers deceived by the advertising. But&para;<br>since the Lanham Act authorizes suit only for commercial injuries,&para;<br>the intervening consumer-deception step is not fatal to the proximate-cause showing the statute requires. Cf. Bridge v. Phoenix Bond&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&amp; Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. 639, 656. Thus, a plaintiff suing under&para;<br>§1125(a) ordinarily must show that its economic or reputational injury flows directly from the deception wrought by the defendant’s advertising; and that occurs when deception of consumers causes them&para;<br>to withhold trade from the plaintiff. Pp. 13–15.&para;<br>(3) Direct application of the zone-of-interests test and the proximate-cause requirement supplies the relevant limits on who may sue&para;<br>under §1125(a). These principles provide better guidance than the&para;<br>multifactor balancing test urged by Lexmark, the direct-competitor&para;<br>test, or the reasonable-interest test applied by the Sixth Circuit.&para;<br>Pp. 15–18.&para;<br>(c) Under these principles, Static Control comes within the class of&para;<br>plaintiffs authorized to sue under §1125(a). Its alleged injuries—lost&para;<br>sales and damage to its business reputation—fall within the zone of&para;<br>interests protected by the Act, and Static Control sufficiently alleged&para;<br>that its injuries were proximately caused by Lexmark’s misrepresentations.

S. C. §1125(a).&para;<br>I. Background&para;<br>Lexmark manufactures and sells laser printers. It also&para;<br>sells toner cartridges for those printers (toner being the&para;<br>powdery ink that laser printers use to create images on&para;<br>paper). Lexmark designs its printers to work only with its&para;<br>own style of cartridges, and it therefore dominates the&para;<br>market for cartridges compatible with its printers. That&para;<br>market, however, is not devoid of competitors. Other&para;<br>businesses, called “remanufacturers,” acquire used Lexmark toner cartridges, refurbish them, and sell them in&para;<br>competition with new and refurbished cartridges sold by&para;<br>Lexmark.&para;<br>Lexmark would prefer that its customers return their&para;<br>empty cartridges to it for refurbishment and resale, rather&para;<br>than sell those cartridges to a remanufacturer.&para;<br>So&para;<br>Lexmark introduced what it called a “Prebate” program,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LEXMARK INT’L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL&para;<br>COMPONENTS, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>which enabled customers to purchase new toner cartridges&para;<br>at a 20-percent discount if they would agree to return the&para;<br>cartridge to Lexmark once it was empty. Those terms&para;<br>were communicated to consumers through notices printed&para;<br>on the toner-cartridge boxes, which advised the consumer&para;<br>that opening the box would indicate assent to the terms—&para;<br>a practice commonly known as “shrinkwrap licensing,”&para;<br>see, e.g., ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg, 86 F. 3d 1447, 1449&para;<br>(CA7 1996). To enforce the Prebate terms, Lexmark in­&para;<br>cluded a microchip in each Prebate cartridge that would&para;<br>disable the cartridge after it ran out of toner; for the car­&para;<br>tridge to be used again, the microchip would have to be&para;<br>replaced by Lexmark.&para;<br>Static Control is not itself a manufacturer or remanu­&para;<br>facturer of toner cartridges. It is, rather, “the market&para;<br>leader [in] making and selling the components necessary&para;<br>to remanufacture Lexmark cartridges.” 697 F. 3d 387, 396&para;<br>(CA6 2012) (case below). In addition to supplying remanu­&para;<br>facturers with toner and various replacement parts, Static&para;<br>Control developed a microchip that could mimic the micro­&para;<br>chip in Lexmark’s Prebate cartridges. By purchasing&para;<br>Static Control’s microchips and using them to replace the&para;<br>Lexmark microchip, remanufacturers were able to refur­&para;<br>bish and resell used Prebate cartridges.&para;<br>Lexmark did not take kindly to that development. In&para;<br>2002, it sued Static Control, alleging that Static Control’s&para;<br>microchips violated both the Copyright Act of 1976, 17&para;<br>U. S. C. §101 et seq., and the Digital Millennium Copy­&para;<br>right Act, 17 U. S. C. §1201 et seq. Static Control counter­&para;<br>claimed, alleging, among other things, violations of §43(a)&para;<br>of the Lanham Act, 60 Stat. 441, codified at 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1125(a). Section 1125(a) provides:&para;<br>“(1) Any person who, on or in connection with any&para;<br>goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in&para;<br>commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

See Waits v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 978 F. 2d&para;<br>1093, 1108 (CA9 1992). Static Control alleged only false&para;<br>advertising.&para;<br>As relevant to its Lanham Act claim, Static Control&para;<br>alleged two types of false or misleading conduct by&para;<br>Lexmark. First, it alleged that through its Prebate pro­&para;<br>gram Lexmark “purposefully misleads end-users” to be­&para;<br>lieve that they are legally bound by the Prebate terms and&para;<br>are thus required to return the Prebate-labeled cartridge&para;<br>to Lexmark after a single use. App. 31, ¶39. Second, it&para;<br>alleged that upon introducing the Prebate program,&para;<br>Lexmark “sent letters to most of the companies in the&para;<br>toner cartridge remanufacturing business” falsely advising&para;<br>those companies that it was illegal to sell refurbished&para;<br>Prebate cartridges and, in particular, that it was illegal to&para;<br>use Static Control’s products to refurbish those cartridges.&para;<br>Id., at 29, ¶35.

Id., at 43–44, ¶85.&para;<br>It further maintained that Lexmark’s misrepresentations&para;<br>had “proximately caused and [we]re likely to cause injury&para;<br>to [Static Control] by diverting sales from [Static Control]&para;<br>to Lexmark,” and had “substantially injured [its] business&para;<br>reputation” by “leading consumers and others in the trade&para;<br>to believe that [Static Control] is engaged in illegal con­&para;<br>duct.” Id., at 44, ¶88. Static Control sought treble dam­&para;<br>ages, attorney’s fees and costs, and injunctive relief.1&para;<br>The District Court granted Lexmark’s motion to dismiss&para;<br>Static Control’s Lanham Act claim. It held that Static&para;<br>Control lacked “prudential standing” to bring that claim,&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 83, relying on a multifactor balanc­&para;<br>ing test it attributed to Associated Gen. Contractors of&para;<br>Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S. 519 (1983). The court&para;<br>emphasized that there were “more direct plaintiffs in the&para;<br>form of remanufacturers of Lexmark’s cartridges”; that&para;<br>Static Control’s injury was “remot[e]” because it was a&para;<br>mere “byproduct of the supposed manipulation of consum­&para;<br>ers’ relationships with remanufacturers”; and that&para;<br>Lexmark’s “alleged intent [was] to dry up spent cartridge&para;<br>supplies at the remanufacturing level, rather than at&para;<br>[Static Control]’s supply level, making remanufacturers&para;<br>Lexmark’s alleged intended target.” App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>83.&para;<br>The Sixth Circuit reversed the dismissal of Static Con­&para;<br>trol’s Lanham Act claim. 697 F. 3d, at 423.

By contrast, “[t]he&para;<br>Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth [Circuits] use a categorical&para;<br>test, permitting Lanham Act suits only by an actual com­&para;<br>petitor.” 697 F. 3d, at 410 (citing L.

Although we admittedly have placed that&para;<br>test under the “prudential” rubric in the past, see, e.g., Elk&para;<br>Grove, supra, at 12, it does not belong there any more than&para;<br>Associated General Contractors does. Whether a plaintiff comes within “the ‘zone of interests’ ” is an issue&para;<br>that requires us to determine, using traditional tools of&para;<br>statutory interpretation, whether a legislatively conferred&para;<br>cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff ’s claim.&para;<br>See Steel Co. v.

Take, for&para;<br>example, our reluctance to entertain generalized grievances—i.e., suits&para;<br>“claiming only harm to [the plaintiff ’s] and every citizen’s interest in&para;<br>proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that&para;<br>no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at&para;<br>large.” Lujan v.

See, e.g.,&para;<br>Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U. S. 125, 128–129 (2004) (suggesting it is an&para;<br>element of “prudential standing”).

Static Control’s Right To Sue Under §1125(a)&para;<br>Thus, this case presents a straightforward question of&para;<br>statutory interpretation: Does the cause of action in&para;<br>§1125(a) extend to plaintiffs like Static Control? The&para;<br>statute authorizes suit by “any person who believes that&para;<br>he or she is likely to be damaged” by a defendant’s false&para;<br>advertising. §1125(a)(1). Read literally, that broad lan­&para;<br>guage might suggest that an action is available to anyone&para;<br>who can satisfy the minimum requirements of Article III.&para;<br>No party makes that argument, however, and the “unlike­&para;<br>lihood that Congress meant to allow all factually injured&para;<br>plaintiffs to recover persuades us that [§1125(a)] should&para;<br>not get such an expansive reading.” Holmes, 503 U. S., at&para;<br>266 (footnote omitted). We reach that conclusion in light&para;<br>of two relevant background principles already mentioned:&para;<br>zone of interests and proximate causality.&para;<br>A. Zone of Interests&para;<br>First, we presume that a statutory cause of action ex­&para;<br>tends only to plaintiffs whose interests “fall within the&para;<br>zone of interests protected by the law invoked.” Allen, 468&para;<br>U. S., at 751. The modern “zone of interests” formulation&para;<br>originated in Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150 (1970), as a limi­&para;<br>tation on the cause of action for judicial review conferred&para;<br>by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). We have&para;<br>since made clear, however, that it applies to all statutorily&para;<br>created causes of action; that it is a “requirement of gen­&para;<br>eral application”; and that Congress is presumed to “legis­&para;<br>lat[e] against the background of ” the zone-of-interests&para;<br>limitation, “which applies unless it is expressly negated.”&para;<br>Bennett v.

In that context we have often&para;<br>“conspicuously included the word ‘arguably’ in the test to&para;<br>indicate that the benefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff,”&para;<br>and have said that the test “forecloses suit only when a&para;<br>plaintiff ’s ‘interests are so marginally related to or incon­&para;<br>sistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it&para;<br>cannot reasonably be assumed that’ ” Congress authorized&para;<br>that plaintiff to sue.

H. B. Halicki Productions v.&para;<br>United Artists Communications, Inc., 812 F. 2d 1213, 1214&para;<br>(CA9 1987). Section 45 of the Act, codified at 15 U. S.

A consumer who is hoodwinked into purchasing a&para;<br>disappointing product may well have an injury-in-fact&para;<br>cognizable under Article III, but he cannot invoke the&para;<br>protection of the Lanham Act—a conclusion reached by&para;<br>every Circuit to consider the question. See Colligan v.&para;<br>Activities Club of N. Y., Ltd., 442 F. 2d 686, 691–692 (CA2&para;<br>1971); Serbin v.

Even a business misled by a supplier into pur­&para;<br>chasing an inferior product is, like consumers generally,&para;<br>not under the Act’s aegis.&para;<br>B. Proximate Cause&para;<br>Second, we generally presume that a statutory cause of&para;<br>action is limited to plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the statute. For centuries, it&para;<br>has been “a well established principle of [the common] law,&para;<br>that in all cases of loss, we are to attribute it to the proxi­&para;<br>mate cause, and not to any remote cause.” Waters v.&para;<br>Merchants’ Louisville Ins. Co., 11 Pet. 213, 223 (1837); see&para;<br>Holmes, 503 U. S., at 287 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg­&para;<br>ment). That venerable principle reflects the reality that&para;<br>“the judicial remedy cannot encompass every conceivable&para;<br>harm that can be traced to alleged wrongdoing.” Associated Gen. Contractors, 459 U. S., at 536. Congress, we&para;<br>assume, is familiar with the common-law rule and does&para;<br>not mean to displace it sub silentio.

STATIC CONTROL&para;<br>COMPONENTS, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>incorporate a requirement of proximate causation. See,&para;<br>e.g., Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U. S. 336,&para;<br>346 (2005) (securities fraud); Holmes, supra, at 268–270&para;<br>(RICO); Associated Gen. Contractors, supra, at 529–535&para;<br>(Clayton Act). No party disputes that it is proper to read&para;<br>§1125(a) as containing such a requirement, its broad&para;<br>language notwithstanding.&para;<br>The proximate-cause inquiry is not easy to define, and&para;<br>over the years it has taken various forms; but courts have&para;<br>a great deal of experience applying it, and there is a&para;<br>wealth of precedent for them to draw upon in doing so.&para;<br>See Exxon Co., U. S. A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U. S. 830, 838–&para;<br>839 (1996); Pacific Operators Offshore, LLP v. Valladolid,&para;<br>565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part&para;<br>and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3). Proximate­&para;<br>cause analysis is controlled by the nature of the statutory&para;<br>cause of action. The question it presents is whether the&para;<br>harm alleged has a sufficiently close connection to the&para;<br>conduct the statute prohibits.&para;<br>Put differently, the proximate-cause requirement gener­&para;<br>ally bars suits for alleged harm that is “too remote” from&para;<br>the defendant’s unlawful conduct. That is ordinarily the&para;<br>case if the harm is purely derivative of “misfortunes visited&para;<br>upon a third person by the defendant’s acts.” Holmes,&para;<br>supra, at 268–269; see, e.g., Hemi Group, LLC v. City of&para;<br>New York, 559 U. S. 1, 10–11 (2010). In a sense, of course,&para;<br>all commercial injuries from false advertising are deriva­&para;<br>tive of those suffered by consumers who are deceived by&para;<br>the advertising; but since the Lanham Act authorizes suit&para;<br>only for commercial injuries, the intervening step of con­&para;<br>sumer deception is not fatal to the showing of proximate&para;<br>causation required by the statute. See Harold H. Huggins&para;<br>Realty, Inc. v. FNC, Inc., 634 F. 3d 787, 800–801 (CA5&para;<br>2011). That is consistent with our recognition that under&para;<br>common-law principles, a plaintiff can be directly injured&para;<br>by a misrepresentation even where “a third party, and not&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the plaintiff, . . . relied on” it. Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &amp;&para;<br>Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. 639, 656 (2008).&para;<br>We thus hold that a plaintiff suing under §1125(a)&para;<br>ordinarily must show economic or reputational injury&para;<br>flowing directly from the deception wrought by the de­&para;<br>fendant’s advertising; and that that occurs when deception&para;<br>of consumers causes them to withhold trade from the&para;<br>plaintiff. That showing is generally not made when the&para;<br>deception produces injuries to a fellow commercial actor&para;<br>that in turn affect the plaintiff. For example, while a&para;<br>competitor who is forced out of business by a defendant’s&para;<br>false advertising generally will be able to sue for its losses,&para;<br>the same is not true of the competitor’s landlord, its elec­&para;<br>tric company, and other commercial parties who suffer&para;<br>merely as a result of the competitor’s “inability to meet&para;<br>[its] financial obligations.” Anza, 547 U. S., at 458.6&para;<br>C. Proposed Tests&para;<br>At oral argument, Lexmark agreed that the zone of interests and proximate causation supply the relevant back­&para;<br>ground limitations on suit under §1125(a). See Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 4–5, 11–12, 17–18. But it urges us to adopt, as&para;<br>the optimal formulation of those principles, a multifactor&para;<br>balancing test derived from Associated General Contrac——————&para;<br>6 Proximate causation is not a requirement of Article III standing,&para;<br>which requires only that the plaintiff ’s injury be fairly traceable to the&para;<br>defendant’s conduct. Like the zone-of-interests test, see supra, at 8–9,&para;<br>and nn. 3–4, it is an element of the cause of action under the statute,&para;<br>and so is subject to the rule that “the absence of a valid (as opposed to&para;<br>arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdic­&para;<br>tion.” Steel Co., 523 U. S., at 89. But like any other element of a cause&para;<br>of action, it must be adequately alleged at the pleading stage in order&para;<br>for the case to proceed. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662, 678–679&para;<br>(2009). If a plaintiff ’s allegations, taken as true, are insufficient to&para;<br>establish proximate causation, then the complaint must be dismissed; if&para;<br>they are sufficient, then the plaintiff is entitled to an opportunity to&para;<br>prove them.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>LEXMARK INT’L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL&para;<br>COMPONENTS, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>tors. In the alternative, it asks that we adopt a categorical&para;<br>test permitting only direct competitors to sue for false&para;<br>advertising. And although neither party urges adoption of&para;<br>the “reasonable interest” test applied below, several amici&para;<br>do so. While none of those tests is wholly without merit,&para;<br>we decline to adopt any of them. We hold instead that a&para;<br>direct application of the zone-of-interests test and the&para;<br>proximate-cause requirement supplies the relevant limits&para;<br>on who may sue.&para;<br>The balancing test Lexmark advocates was first articu­&para;<br>lated by the Third Circuit in Conte Bros. and later adopted&para;<br>by several other Circuits. Conte Bros. identified five rele­&para;<br>vant considerations:&para;<br>“(1) The nature of the plaintiff ’s alleged injury: Is&para;<br>the injury of a type that Congress sought to redress in&para;<br>providing a private remedy for violations of the [Lan­&para;<br>ham Act]?&para;<br>“(2) The directness or indirectness of the asserted&para;<br>injury.&para;<br>“(3) The proximity or remoteness of the party to the&para;<br>alleged injurious conduct.&para;<br>“(4) The speculativeness of the damages claim.&para;<br>“(5) The risk of duplicative damages or complexity&para;<br>in apportioning damages.” 165 F. 3d, at 233 (citations&para;<br>and internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>This approach reflects a commendable effort to give con­&para;<br>tent to an otherwise nebulous inquiry, but we think it&para;<br>slightly off the mark. The first factor can be read as re­&para;<br>quiring that the plaintiff ’s injury be within the relevant&para;<br>zone of interests and the second and third as requiring&para;<br>(somewhat redundantly) proximate causation; but it is not&para;<br>correct to treat those requirements, which must be met in&para;<br>every case, as mere factors to be weighed in a balance.&para;<br>And the fourth and fifth factors are themselves problem­&para;<br>atic. “[T]he difficulty that can arise when a court attempts&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to ascertain the damages caused by some remote action” is&para;<br>a “motivating principle” behind the proximate-cause re­&para;<br>quirement, Anza, supra, at 457–458; but potential diffi­&para;<br>culty in ascertaining and apportioning damages is not, as&para;<br>Conte Bros. might suggest, an independent basis for deny­&para;<br>ing standing where it is adequately alleged that a defend­&para;<br>ant’s conduct has proximately injured an interest of the&para;<br>plaintiff ’s that the statute protects. Even when a plaintiff&para;<br>cannot quantify its losses with sufficient certainty to recover damages, it may still be entitled to injunctive relief under §1116(a) (assuming it can prove a likelihood of&para;<br>future injury) or disgorgement of the defendant’s ill-gotten&para;<br>profits under §1117(a). See TrafficSchool.com, Inc. v.&para;<br>Edriver Inc., 653 F. 3d 820, 831 (CA9 2011); Johnson &amp;&para;<br>Johnson v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 631 F. 2d 186, 190 (CA2&para;<br>1980). Finally, experience has shown that the Conte Bros.&para;<br>approach, like other open-ended balancing tests, can yield&para;<br>unpredictable and at times arbitrary results. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Tushnet, Running the Gamut from A to B: Federal&para;<br>Trademark and False Advertising Law, 159 U. Pa. L. Rev.&para;<br>1305, 1376–1379 (2011).&para;<br>In contrast to the multifactor balancing approach, the&para;<br>direct-competitor test provides a bright-line rule; but it&para;<br>does so at the expense of distorting the statutory lan­&para;<br>guage. To be sure, a plaintiff who does not compete with&para;<br>the defendant will often have a harder time establishing&para;<br>proximate causation. But a rule categorically prohibiting&para;<br>all suits by noncompetitors would read too much into the&para;<br>Act’s reference to “unfair competition” in §1127. By the&para;<br>time the Lanham Act was adopted, the common-law tort of&para;<br>unfair competition was understood not to be limited to&para;<br>actions between competitors. One leading authority in the&para;<br>field wrote that “there need be no competition in unfair&para;<br>competition,” just as “[t]here is no soda in soda water, no&para;<br>grapes in grape fruit, no bread in bread fruit, and a clothes&para;<br>horse is not a horse but is good enough to hang things&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>LEXMARK INT’L, INC. v.

It is thus a mis­&para;<br>take to infer that because the Lanham Act treats false&para;<br>advertising as a form of unfair competition, it can protect&para;<br>only the false-advertiser’s direct competitors.&para;<br>Finally, there is the “reasonable interest” test applied by&para;<br>the Sixth Circuit in this case. As typically formulated,&para;<br>it requires a commercial plaintiff to “demonstrate ‘(1) a&para;<br>reasonable interest to be protected against the alleged&para;<br>false advertising and (2) a reasonable basis for believing&para;<br>that the interest is likely to be damaged by the alleged&para;<br>false advertising.’ ” 697 F. 3d, at 410 (quoting Famous&para;<br>Horse, 624 F. 3d, at 113). A purely practical objection to&para;<br>the test is that it lends itself to widely divergent application. Indeed, its vague language can be understood as&para;<br>requiring only the bare minimum of Article III standing.&para;<br>The popularity of the multifactor balancing test reflects its&para;<br>appeal to courts tired of “grappl[ing] with defining” the&para;<br>“ ‘reasonable interest’ ” test “with greater precision.” Conte&para;<br>Bros., 165 F. 3d, at 231. The theoretical difficulties with&para;<br>the test are even more substantial: The relevant question&para;<br>is not whether the plaintiff ’s interest is “reasonable,” but&para;<br>whether it is one the Lanham Act protects; and not&para;<br>whether there is a “reasonable basis” for the plaintiff ’s&para;<br>claim of harm, but whether the harm alleged is proximately&para;<br>tied to the defendant’s conduct. In short, we think the&para;<br>principles set forth above will provide clearer and more&para;<br>accurate guidance than the “reasonable interest” test.&para;<br>IV.

S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>To begin, Static Control’s alleged injuries—lost sales&para;<br>and damage to its business reputation—are injuries to&para;<br>precisely the sorts of commercial interests the Act pro­&para;<br>tects. Static Control is suing not as a deceived consumer,&para;<br>but as a “perso[n] engaged in” “commerce within the con­&para;<br>trol of Congress” whose position in the marketplace has&para;<br>been damaged by Lexmark’s false advertising. §1127.&para;<br>There is no doubt that it is within the zone of interests&para;<br>protected by the statute.&para;<br>Static Control also sufficiently alleged that its injuries&para;<br>were proximately caused by Lexmark’s misrepresenta­&para;<br>tions. This case, it is true, does not present the “classic&para;<br>Lanham Act false-advertising claim” in which “ ‘one com­&para;<br>petito[r] directly injur[es] another by making false state­&para;<br>ments about his own goods [or the competitor’s goods] and&para;<br>thus inducing customers to switch.’ ” Harold H. Huggins&para;<br>Realty, 634 F. 3d, at 799, n. 24. But although diversion of&para;<br>sales to a direct competitor may be the paradigmatic direct&para;<br>injury from false advertising, it is not the only type of&para;<br>injury cognizable under §1125(a). For at least two rea­&para;<br>sons, Static Control’s allegations satisfy the requirement&para;<br>of proximate causation.&para;<br>First, Static Control alleged that Lexmark disparaged&para;<br>its business and products by asserting that Static Con­&para;<br>trol’s business was illegal. See 697 F. 3d, at 411, n. 10&para;<br>(noting allegation that Lexmark “directly target[ed] Static&para;<br>Control” when it “falsely advertised that Static Control&para;<br>infringed Lexmark’s patents”). When a defendant harms&para;<br>a plaintiff ’s reputation by casting aspersions on its busi­&para;<br>ness, the plaintiff ’s injury flows directly from the audi­&para;<br>ence’s belief in the disparaging statements. Courts have&para;<br>therefore afforded relief under §1125(a) not only where a&para;<br>defendant denigrates a plaintiff ’s product by name, see,&para;<br>e.g., McNeilab, Inc. v. American Home Prods. Corp., 848&para;<br>F. 2d 34, 38 (CA2 1988), but also where the defendant&para;<br>damages the product’s reputation by, for example, equat­&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>LEXMARK INT’L, INC. v. STATIC CONTROL&para;<br>COMPONENTS, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ing it with an inferior product, see, e.g., Camel Hair and&para;<br>Cashmere Inst. of Am., Inc. v. Associated Dry Goods Corp.,&para;<br>799 F. 2d 6, 7–8, 11–12 (CA1 1986); PPX Enterprises, Inc.&para;<br>v. Audiofidelity, Inc., 746 F. 2d 120, 122, 125 (CA2 1984).&para;<br>Traditional proximate-causation principles support those&para;<br>results: As we have observed, a defendant who “ ‘seeks to&para;<br>promote his own interests by telling a known falsehood to&para;<br>or about the plaintiff or his product’ ” may be said to have&para;<br>proximately caused the plaintiff ’s harm. Bridge, 553&para;<br>U. S., at 657 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts §870,&para;<br>Comment h (1977); emphasis added in Bridge).&para;<br>The District Court emphasized that Lexmark and Static&para;<br>Control are not direct competitors. But when a party&para;<br>claims reputational injury from disparagement, competi­&para;<br>tion is not required for proximate cause; and that is true&para;<br>even if the defendant’s aim was to harm its immediate&para;<br>competitors, and the plaintiff merely suffered collateral&para;<br>damage. Consider two rival carmakers who purchase&para;<br>airbags for their cars from different third-party manufac­&para;<br>turers. If the first carmaker, hoping to divert sales from&para;<br>the second, falsely proclaims that the airbags used by the&para;<br>second carmaker are defective, both the second carmaker&para;<br>and its airbag supplier may suffer reputational injury, and&para;<br>their sales may decline as a result. In those circumstances,&para;<br>there is no reason to regard either party’s injury as derivative of the other’s; each is directly and independently&para;<br>harmed by the attack on its merchandise.&para;<br>In addition, Static Control adequately alleged proximate&para;<br>causation by alleging that it designed, manufactured, and&para;<br>sold microchips that both (1) were necessary for, and&para;<br>(2) had no other use than, refurbishing Lexmark toner&para;<br>cartridges. See App. 13, ¶31; id., at 37, ¶54.7 It follows&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 We understand this to be the thrust of both sides’ allegations con­&para;<br>cerning Static Control’s design and sale of specialized microchips for&para;<br>the specific purpose of enabling the remanufacture of Lexmark’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>from that allegation that any false advertising that re­&para;<br>duced the remanufacturers’ business necessarily injured&para;<br>Static Control as well. Taking Static Control’s assertions&para;<br>at face value, there is likely to be something very close to a&para;<br>1:1 relationship between the number of refurbished Pre­&para;<br>bate cartridges sold (or not sold) by the remanufacturers&para;<br>and the number of Prebate microchips sold (or not sold) by&para;<br>Static Control. “Where the injury alleged is so integral an&para;<br>aspect of the [violation] alleged, there can be no question”&para;<br>that proximate cause is satisfied. Blue Shield of Va. v.&para;<br>McCready, 457 U. S. 465, 479 (1982).&para;<br>To be sure, on this view, the causal chain linking Static&para;<br>Control’s injuries to consumer confusion is not direct, but&para;<br>includes the intervening link of injury to the remanufac­&para;<br>turers. Static Control’s allegations therefore might not&para;<br>support standing under a strict application of the “ ‘ “gen­&para;<br>eral tendency” ’ ” not to stretch proximate causation “ ‘ “be­&para;<br>yond the first step.” ’ ” Holmes, 503 U. S., at 271. But the&para;<br>reason for that general tendency is that there ordinarily is&para;<br>a “discontinuity” between the injury to the direct victim&para;<br>and the injury to the indirect victim, so that the latter&para;<br>is not surely attributable to the former (and thus also to&para;<br>the defendant’s conduct), but might instead have resulted&para;<br>from “any number of [other] reasons.” Anza, 547 U. S., at&para;<br>458–459. That is not the case here. Static Control’s alle­&para;<br>gations suggest that if the remanufacturers sold 10,000&para;<br>fewer refurbished cartridges because of Lexmark’s false&para;<br>advertising, then it would follow more or less automatically&para;<br>that Static Control sold 10,000 fewer microchips for the&para;<br>same reason, without the need for any “speculative . . .&para;<br>proceedings” or “intricate, uncertain inquiries.” Id., at&para;<br>459–460. In these relatively unique circumstances, the&para;<br>remanufacturers are not “more immediate victim[s]” than&para;<br>Static Control.
