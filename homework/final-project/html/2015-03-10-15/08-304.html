S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A). Here, federal contracts provided that two&para;<br>North Carolina counties would remediate areas damaged by flooding&para;<br>and that the Federal Government would shoulder most of the costs.&para;<br>Respondent Wilson, then an employee of a local government body in&para;<br>volved in this effort, alerted local and federal officials about possible&para;<br>fraud. Both the county and the State issued reports identifying po&para;<br>tential irregularities in the contracts’ administration. Subsequently,&para;<br>Wilson filed a qui tam action, alleging, as relevant here, that peti&para;<br>tioners, county conservation districts and local and federal officials,&para;<br>knowingly submitted false payment claims in violation of the FCA.&para;<br>The District Court ultimately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction be&para;<br>cause Wilson had not refuted that her action was based upon allega&para;<br>tions publicly disclosed in the county and state reports, which it held&para;<br>were “administrative” reports under the FCA’s public disclosure bar.&para;<br>In reversing, the Fourth Circuit concluded that only federal adminis&para;<br>trative reports may trigger the public disclosure bar.&para;<br>Held: The reference to “administrative” reports, audits, and investiga&para;<br>tions in §3730(e)(4)(A) encompasses disclosures made in state and lo&para;<br>cal sources as well as federal sources. Pp. 4–21.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION &para;<br>&para;<br>DIST. v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>(a) Section 3730(e)(4)(A) specifies three categories of disclosures&para;<br>that can deprive federal courts of jurisdiction over qui tam suits. The&para;<br>language at issue is contained in the second category (Category 2).&para;<br>Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(b) The FCA’s plain text does not limit “administrative” to federal&para;<br>sources. Because that term modifies “report, hearing, audit, or inves&para;<br>tigation” in a provision about “the public disclosure” of fraud on the&para;<br>United States, it is most naturally read to describe government&para;<br>agency activities. But since “administrative” is not itself modified by&para;<br>“federal,” there is no immediately apparent basis for excluding state&para;<br>and local agency activities from its ambit. The interpretive maxim&para;<br>noscitur a sociis—“a word may be known by the company it keeps,”&para;<br>Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 514, 519—does not&para;<br>support the Fourth Circuit’s more limited view. In Category 2, “ad&para;<br>ministrative” is sandwiched between the federal terms “congres&para;<br>sional” and “[GAO],” but these items are too few and too disparate to&para;<br>qualify as “a string of statutory terms,” S. D. Warren Co. v. Maine&para;<br>Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547 U. S. 370, 378, or “items in a&para;<br>list,” Beecham v. United States, 511 U. S. 368, 371, for noscitur a so&para;<br>ciis purposes. Furthermore, evaluating “administrative” within the&para;<br>public disclosure bar’s larger scheme, the Court observes that Cate&para;<br>gory 2’s terms are themselves sandwiched between phrases in Cate&para;<br>gory 1 (“criminal, civil, or administrative hearing”) and Category 3&para;<br>(“news media”) that are generally understood to include nonfederal&para;<br>sources; and Category 1 contains the same term (“administrative”)&para;<br>that is at issue. Even if Category 1 were best understood to refer to&para;<br>adjudicative proceedings and Category 2 to legislative or quasi&para;<br>legislative activities, state and local administrative sources of a legis&para;<br>lative-type character are presumably just as public, and just as likely&para;<br>to put the Federal Government on notice of a potential fraud, as state&para;<br>and local administrative hearings of an adjudicatory character. The&para;<br>FCA’s overall federal focus shines no light on the specific question&para;<br>whether the public disclosure bar extends to nonfederal contexts.&para;<br>And the fact that state legislative sources are not included in&para;<br>§3730(e)(4)(A) carries no clear implications for the status of state&para;<br>administrative sources. Pp. 5–12.&para;<br>(c) The legislative record does not support an exclusively federal in&para;<br>terpretation of “administrative.” The current §3730(e)(4)(A) was en&para;<br>acted to strike a balance between encouraging private persons to root&para;<br>out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits. How exactly the statute&para;<br>came to strike this balance as it did is uncertain, as significant sub&para;<br>stantive changes—including the introduction of “administrative” in&para;<br>Category 2—were inserted without floor debate or other discussion,&para;<br>as “technical” amendments. Though Congress wanted “to strengthen&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

WILSON &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 1995 the United States Department of Agriculture&para;<br>(USDA) entered into contracts with two counties in North&para;<br>Carolina authorizing them to perform, or to hire others to&para;<br>perform, cleanup and repair work in areas that had suf&para;<br>fered extensive flooding. The Federal Government agreed&para;<br>to shoulder 75 percent of the contract costs. Respondent&para;<br>Karen T. Wilson was at that time an employee of the&para;<br>Graham County Soil and Conservation District, a special&para;<br>purpose government body that had been delegated partial&para;<br>responsibility for coordinating and performing the reme&para;<br>diation effort. Suspecting possible fraud in connection&para;<br>with this effort, Wilson voiced her concerns to local offi&para;<br>cials in the summer of 1995. She also sent a letter to, and&para;<br>had a meeting with, agents of the USDA.&para;<br>Graham County officials began an investigation. An&para;<br>accounting firm hired by the county performed an audit&para;<br>and, in 1996, issued a report (Audit Report) that identified&para;<br>several potential irregularities in the county’s administra&para;<br>tion of the contracts. Shortly thereafter, the North Caro&para;<br>lina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural&para;<br>Resources issued a report (DEHNR Report) identifying&para;<br>similar problems. The USDA’s Office of Inspector General&para;<br>eventually issued a third report that contained additional&para;<br>findings.&para;<br>In 2001 Wilson filed this action, alleging that petition&para;<br>ers, the Graham County and Cherokee County Soil and&para;<br>Water Conservation Districts and a number of local and&para;<br>federal officials, violated the False Claims Act (FCA) by&para;<br>knowingly submitting false claims for payment pursuant&para;<br>to the 1995 contracts. She further alleged that petitioners&para;<br>retaliated against her for aiding the federal investigation&para;<br>of those false claims. Following this Court’s review of the&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>tense in discussing the statute as it existed at the time this case was&para;<br>&para;<br>argued. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Wilson, 545 U. S. 409 (2005), the&para;<br>Court of Appeals ordered that that claim be dismissed as&para;<br>time barred. 424 F. 3d 437 (CA4 2005). On remand, the&para;<br>District Court subsequently dismissed Wilson’s qui tam&para;<br>action for lack of jurisdiction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a–&para;<br>105a. The court found that Wilson had failed to refute&para;<br>that her action was based upon allegations publicly dis&para;<br>closed in the Audit Report and the DEHNR Report. Id., at&para;<br>95a–98a. Those reports, the District Court determined,&para;<br>constituted “administrative . . . report[s], . . . audit[s], or&para;<br>investigation[s]” within the meaning of the FCA’s public&para;<br>disclosure bar, 31 U.

WILSON &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>II&para;<br>We have examined the FCA’s qui tam provisions in&para;<br>several recent opinions.3 At issue in this case is the FCA’s&para;<br>public disclosure bar, which deprives courts of jurisdiction&para;<br>over qui tam suits when the relevant information has&para;<br>already entered the public domain through certain chan&para;<br>nels. The statute contains three categories of jurisdiction&para;<br>stripping disclosures. Following the example of the Court&para;<br>of Appeals, see 528 F. 3d, at 300–301, we have inserted&para;<br>Arabic numerals to identify these categories:&para;<br>“No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under&para;<br>this section based upon the public disclosure of allega&para;<br>tions or transactions [1] in a criminal, civil, or admin&para;<br>istrative hearing, [2] in a congressional, administra&para;<br>tive, or Government Accounting Office [(GAO)] report,&para;<br>hearing, audit, or investigation, or [3] from the news&para;<br>media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney&para;<br>General or the person bringing the action is an origi&para;<br>nal source[4] of the information.” §3730(e)(4)(A) (foot&para;<br>note omitted).&para;<br>This dispute turns on the meaning of the adjective “ad&para;<br>ministrative” in the second category (Category 2): whether&para;<br>it embraces only forums that are federal in nature, as&para;<br>respondent alleges, or whether it extends to disclosures&para;<br>made in state and local sources such as the DEHNR Re&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 See,&para;<br>&para;<br>e.g., Rockwell Int’l Corp. v.

Although there is&para;<br>some overlap among the three types of argument, it is&para;<br>useful to discuss them separately. We begin with the text.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The term “administrative” “may, in various contexts,&para;<br>bear a range of related meanings,” Chandler v. Judicial&para;<br>Council of Tenth Circuit, 398 U. S. 74, 103, n. 8 (1970)&para;<br>(Harlan, J., concurring in denial of writ), pertaining to&para;<br>private bodies as well as to governmental bodies. When&para;<br>used to modify the nouns “report, hearing, audit, or inves&para;<br>tigation,” in the context of a statutory provision about “the&para;<br>public disclosure” of fraud on the United States, the term&para;<br>is most naturally read to describe the activities of govern&para;<br>mental agencies. See Black’s Law Dictionary 49 (9th ed.&para;<br>2009) (hereinafter Black’s) (defining “administration,” “[i]n&para;<br>public law, [as] the practical management and direction of&para;<br>the executive department and its agencies”). Given that&para;<br>“administrative” is not itself modified by “federal,” there is&para;<br>no immediately apparent textual basis for excluding the&para;<br>activities of state and local agencies (or their contractors)&para;<br>from its ambit. As the Court of Appeals recognized, “the&para;<br>statute by its express terms does not limit its reach to&para;<br>federal administrative reports or investigations.” 528&para;<br>F. 3d, at 301. “[T]here is nothing inherently federal about&para;<br>the word ‘administrative,’ and Congress did not define the&para;<br>term in the FCA.” Id., at 302.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals’ conclusion that “administrative”&para;<br>nevertheless reaches only federal sources rested on its&para;<br>application of the interpretive maxim noscitur a sociis.&para;<br>See id., at 302–305.

All participants in this&para;<br>litigation acknowledge that the terms “congressional” and&para;<br>“[GAO]” are federal in nature; Congress is the Legislative&para;<br>Branch of the Federal Government,5 and the GAO is a&para;<br>federal agency.6 Relying on our opinions in S.

S. 368&para;<br>(1994), the Court of Appeals reasoned that “the placement&para;<br>of ‘administrative’ squarely in the middle of a list of obvi&para;<br>ously federal sources strongly suggests that ‘administra&para;<br>tive’ should likewise be restricted to federal administrative&para;<br>reports, hearings, audits, or investigations.” 528 F. 3d, at&para;<br>302. In so holding, the Court of Appeals embraced what&para;<br>we might call the Sandwich Theory of the Third Circuit.&para;<br>Both courts “ ‘f[ou]nd it hard to believe that the drafters of&para;<br>this provision intended the word “administrative” to refer&para;<br>to both state and federal reports when it lies sandwiched&para;<br>between modifiers which are unquestionably federal in&para;<br>character.’ ” Ibid.

Third, whereas federal administrative proceed&para;<br>ings can be presumed to provide the Attorney General&para;<br>with a fair opportunity to decide whether to bring an FCA&para;<br>action based on revelations made therein, the Attorney&para;<br>General is much less likely to learn of fraud disclosed in&para;<br>state proceedings.

Their&para;<br>argument rests on an empirical proposition: “While federal&para;<br>inquiries and their outcomes are readily available to De&para;<br>partment of Justice [(DOJ)] attorneys, many state and&para;<br>local reports and investigations never come to the atten&para;<br>tion of federal authorities.” Brief for United States 22; see&para;<br>also 528 F. 3d, at 306 (“Because the federal government is&para;<br>unlikely to learn about state and local investigations, a&para;<br>large number of fraudulent claims against the government&para;<br>would go unremedied without the financial incentives&para;<br>offered by the qui tam provisions of the FCA”). This&para;<br>proposition is not implausible, but it is sheer conjecture.&para;<br>Numerous federal investigations may be occurring at any&para;<br>given time, and DOJ attorneys may not reliably learn&para;<br>about their findings. DOJ attorneys may learn about&para;<br>quite a few state and local inquiries, especially when the&para;<br>inquiries are conducted pursuant to a joint federal-state&para;<br>program financed in part by federal dollars, such as the&para;<br>program at issue in this case.18 Just how accessible to the&para;<br>Attorney General a typical state or local source will be, as&para;<br>compared to a federal source, is an open question. And it&para;<br>——————&para;<br>18 In some instances, federal law dictates that state and local govern&para;<br>ments receiving federal funds perform an audit of their programs. See&para;<br>31 U. S.

The statutory touchstone,&para;<br>once again, is whether the allegations of fraud have been&para;<br>“public[ly] disclos[ed],” §3730(e)(4)(A), not whether they&para;<br>have landed on the desk of a DOJ lawyer.&para;<br>Respondent’s argument also gives insufficient weight to&para;<br>Congress’ decision to bar qui tam actions based on disclo&para;<br>sures “from the news media.” Ibid. Because there was no&para;<br>such bar prior to 1986, the addition of the news media as a&para;<br>jurisdiction-stripping category forecloses the suggestion&para;<br>that the 1986 amendments implemented a single-minded&para;<br>intent to increase the availability of qui tam litigation.&para;<br>And since the “news media” include a large number of&para;<br>local newspapers and radio stations, this category likely&para;<br>describes a multitude of sources that would seldom come&para;<br>to the attention of the Attorney General.&para;<br>As for respondent and her amici’s concern that local&para;<br>governments will insulate themselves from qui tam liabil&para;<br>ity “through careful, low key ‘disclosures’ ” of potential&para;<br>fraud, Brief for American Center for Law and Justice as&para;<br>Amicus Curiae 17, this argument rests not just on specu&para;<br>lation but indeed on rather strained speculation. Any&para;<br>such disclosure would not immunize the local government&para;<br>from FCA liability in an action brought by the United&para;<br>States, see Rockwell Int’l Corp. v. United States, 549 U. S.&para;<br>457, 478 (2007)—and to the contrary it could tip off the&para;<br>Attorney General that such an action might be fruitful. It&para;<br>seems to us that petitioners have the more clear-eyed view&para;<br>when they assert that, “[g]iven the fact that the submis&para;<br>sion of a false claim to the United States subjects a defen&para;<br>dant to criminal liability, fines, debarment, treble dam&para;<br>ages and attorneys’ fees, no rational entity would prepare&para;<br>a report that self-discloses fraud with the sole purpose of&para;<br>cutting off qui tam actions.” Reply Brief for Petitioners 19;&para;<br>see also United States ex rel.

UNITED STATES EX REL. WILSON &para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>Section 3730(e)(4)(A) sets forth three categories of “pub&para;<br>lic disclosure[s]” that trigger the FCA’s jurisdictional bar:&para;<br>“allegations or transactions [1] in a criminal, civil, or&para;<br>administrative hearing, [2] in a congressional, administra&para;<br>tive, or [GAO] report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or&para;<br>[3] from the news media.”2 (Like the majority, I have&para;<br>inserted Arabic numerals and refer to the three phrases as&para;<br>“categories.”) “It is a ‘fundamental canon of statutory&para;<br>construction that the words of a statute must be read in&para;<br>their context and with a view to their place in the overall&para;<br>statutory scheme.’ ” FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco&para;<br>Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 133 (2000) (quoting Davis v. Michi&para;<br>gan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989)). No&para;<br>party here disputes that “congressional” and “[GAO]” refer&para;<br>only to Federal Government sources. Ante, at 6, and nn.&para;<br>5–6. As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 5, the word&para;<br>“administrative” is more capacious, potentially reaching&para;<br>not only federal, state, and local government sources but&para;<br>also disclosures by private entities. See, e.g., Black’s Law&para;<br>Dictionary 42 (5th ed. 1979) (defining “administrative” as&para;<br>“pertain[ing] to administration, especially management,&para;<br>. . . [of] the execution, application or conduct of persons or&para;<br>things”).&para;<br>Like the Court of Appeals, I view Congress’ choice of two&para;<br>“clearly federal terms [to] bookend the not-so-clearly fed&para;<br>eral term” as a “very strong contextual cue about the&para;<br>meaning of ‘administrative.’ ” 528 F. 3d 292, 302 (CA4&para;<br>2008). “ ‘The maxim noscitur a sociis, . . . while not an&para;<br>inescapable rule, is often wisely applied where a word is&para;<br>capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 As&para;<br>&para;<br>the Court observes, in enacting §3730(e)(4)(A) Congress errone&para;<br>ously referred to the General Accounting Office—now renamed the&para;<br>Government Accountability Office—as the “Government Accounting&para;<br>Office.” Ante, at 6, n. 6.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

S. 250, 255 (2000) (quoting Jarecki v. G. D.&para;<br>Searle &amp; Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961)). Here, the imme&para;<br>diate proximity of “congressional” and “[GAO]” suggests&para;<br>that “administrative” should be read, like its neighbors, as&para;<br>referring to Federal Government sources. If Congress had&para;<br>intended to include state or local government administra&para;<br>tive materials, it could have said so, for instance by refer&para;<br>ring generically to “governmental” sources. See 528 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 304–305.&para;<br>The Court applies the logic that underlies the noscitur a&para;<br>sociis canon in concluding that “administrative” does not&para;<br>refer to private entities because of the meaning suggested&para;<br>by the slightly more distant neighbors “report, hearing,&para;<br>audit, or investigation.” See ante, at 5. I agree with the&para;<br>majority that “administrative” in this context does not&para;<br>reach private entities. But in my view, “congressional”&para;<br>and “[GAO]” provide the better textual grounding for that&para;<br>conclusion. I see no reason why the “administrati[on]” of a&para;<br>private university, for instance, could not issue a “report,”&para;<br>order an “audit” or “investigation,” or conduct a “hearing.”&para;<br>Nor, contrary to the majority’s suggestion, are private&para;<br>entities—particularly those receiving federal funds or&para;<br>participating in federal programs—incapable of making&para;<br>“public disclosure[s]” of fraud on the Federal Government.&para;<br>Despite its own implicit reliance on the canon, the Court&para;<br>nevertheless rejects the Court of Appeals’ application of&para;<br>noscitur a sociis to interpret the three terms in Category 2,&para;<br>concluding that “[a] list of three items, each quite distinct&para;<br>from the other no matter how construed, is too short to be&para;<br>particularly illuminating.” Ante, at 6–7. The three terms&para;<br>in Category 2, the Court concludes, are “too few and too&para;<br>disparate” to justify invocation of noscitur a sociis. Ante,&para;<br>at 7. We have not previously constrained the canon in this&para;<br>way, and I would not do so here.&para;<br>To take just one example, in Jarecki we construed the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION &para;<br>&para;<br>DIST. v.

S., at 304–305 (quoting&para;<br>§456(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939). Recogniz&para;<br>ing that the word “ ‘[d]iscovery’ ” is “usable in many con&para;<br>texts and with various shades of meaning,” we observed&para;<br>that it “gathers meaning from the words around it” and&para;<br>concluded that “[t]he three words in conjunction . . . all&para;<br>describe income-producing activity in the oil and gas and&para;<br>mining industries.” Id., at 307. As a result, and in light of&para;<br>other contextual evidence supporting the same conclusion,&para;<br>we held that sales of newly invented drugs or camera&para;<br>equipment did not give rise to “abnormal income” even if&para;<br>such inventions might otherwise be understood as “dis&para;<br>cover[ies].” See id., at 307–313. In my view, the three&para;<br>terms in Category 2 are no more “distinct” or “disparate,”&para;<br>ante, at 7, than the phrase at issue in Jarecki, particularly&para;<br>given the expansive plain meaning of “discovery.” Cf.&para;<br>ante, at 7, n. 7. Here, application of the noscitur a sociis&para;<br>principle readily yields a common feature: The sources at&para;<br>issue are federal in nature, not related to state or local&para;<br>governments or private entities. See Third Nat. Bank in&para;<br>Nashville v. Impac Limited, Inc., 432 U. S. 312, 322–323,&para;<br>315 (1977) (applying principle that “words grouped in a&para;<br>list should be given related meaning” where term “ ‘injunc&para;<br>tion’ ” was “sandwiched” between two other words in the&para;<br>statutory phrase “ ‘attachment, injunction, or execution’ ”).3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The Court relies on Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 338–339&para;<br>(1979), for the proposition that we should not “ ‘rob’ ” any of the three&para;<br>terms in Category 2 of 31 U. S. C. §3730(e)(4)(A) of “ ‘its independent&para;<br>and ordinary significance.’ ” Ante, at 7. But Reiter involved the statu&para;<br>tory term “business or property.” Those two words less readily suggest&para;<br>a shared limiting principle than do “congressional, administrative, or&para;<br>[GAO].” Moreover, our concern about “rob[bing]” the word “ ‘property’ ”&para;<br>of its broader meaning rested on a desire not to “ignore the disjunctive&para;<br>‘or’ ” in the statutory pairing. 442 U.

There is&para;<br>no conflict, however, if both categories are read, as re&para;<br>spondent and the Solicitor General urge, as exclusively&para;<br>federal. See Brief for Respondent 23–24; Brief for United&para;<br>States as Amicus Curiae 25–26. Even reading Category 1&para;<br>more broadly, however, does not change the exclusively&para;<br>federal nature of “congressional” and “[GAO],” which&para;<br>undermines whatever inference might be drawn from&para;<br>taking the statutory terms in strict succession. Treating&para;<br>the entirety of §3730(e)(4)(A) as an undifferentiated list of&para;<br>items gives short shrift to the syntactical choices Congress&para;<br>made in offsetting each category with commas and prepo&para;<br>sitions, and in providing distinct classes of adjectives that&para;<br>modify different nouns.&para;<br>Finally, the Court also views “news media” as “distinctly&para;<br>nonfederal in nature.” Ante, at 8–9.

Because Congress did not&para;<br>employ a completely disjunctive list in §3730(e)(4)(A)—i.e., “congres&para;<br>sional or administrative or [GAO]”—the Reiter principle applies with&para;<br>less force.

First, prior to the&para;<br>1986 amendments, the “Government knowledge” bar&para;<br>unquestionably referred only to information in the posses&para;<br>sion of the Federal Government.4 Even still, the bar was&para;<br>criticized as overly restrictive. A Senate Report on an&para;<br>initial version of the 1986 legislation, for instance, de&para;<br>scribed the FCA’s history and need for legislative reform,&para;<br>noting “several restrictive court interpretations of the act&para;<br>. . . which tend to thwart the effectiveness of the statute.”&para;<br>S. Rep. No. 99–345, p. 4 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.). For&para;<br>instance, courts had applied the Government knowledge&para;<br>bar “even if the Government makes no effort to investigate&para;<br>or take action after . . . original allegations [a]re received.”&para;<br>Id., at 12 (citing United States ex rel.

Today’s decision risks such a&para;<br>result. The Court imposes a jurisdictional bar that is by&para;<br>all appearances more restrictive of qui tam suits than the&para;<br>pre-1986 regime. Construing §3730(e)(4)(A) to encompass&para;<br>the thousands of state and local government administra&para;<br>tive reports produced each year effectively imputes to the&para;<br>Federal Government knowledge of such sources, whether&para;<br>or not the Government is aware of the information or in a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 In&para;<br>&para;<br>June 1986, the House Committee on the Judiciary reported a bill&para;<br>that would have barred qui tam actions based on information “which&para;<br>the Government disclosed as a basis for allegations made in a prior&para;<br>administrative, civil, or criminal proceeding,” “disclosed during the&para;<br>course of a congressional investigation,” or “disseminated by any news&para;<br>media.” H. R. Rep. No. 99–660, pp. 2, 3 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). The references to information disclosed by the Government&para;<br>itself (with a capital “G”) and to “congressional investigation[s]” connote&para;<br>federal, not state or local, government sources. In July, the Senate&para;<br>Committee on the Judiciary reported its own version of the bill, barring&para;<br>actions “based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of&para;<br>a civil suit in which the Government is already a party, or within six&para;<br>months of the disclosure of specific information relating to such allega&para;<br>tions or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, a&para;<br>congressional or Government Accounting Office report or hearing, or&para;<br>from the news media.” S.

The reference to suits in which&para;<br>the Federal Government is a party and absence of the ambiguous term&para;<br>“administrative” in the bill’s reference to “congressional or [GAO]”&para;<br>reports or hearings, similarly tend to exclude disclosures from state or&para;<br>local government reports.
