UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–182.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued April 25, 2012—Decided June 25, 2012&para;<br>&para;<br>An Arizona statute known as S. B. 1070 was enacted in 2010 to address&para;<br>pressing issues related to the large number of unlawful aliens in the&para;<br>State. The United States sought to enjoin the law as preempted. The&para;<br>District Court issued a preliminary injunction preventing four of its&para;<br>provisions from taking effect. Section 3 makes failure to comply with&para;<br>federal alien-registration requirements a state misdemeanor; §5(C)&para;<br>makes it a misdemeanor for an unauthorized alien to seek or engage&para;<br>in work in the State; §6 authorizes state and local officers to arrest&para;<br>without a warrant a person “the officer has probable cause to believe&para;<br>. . . has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States”; and §2(B) requires officers conducting a&para;<br>stop, detention, or arrest to make efforts, in some circumstances, to&para;<br>verify the person’s immigration status with the Federal Government.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit affirmed, agreeing that the United States had established a likelihood of success on its preemption claims.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The Federal Government’s broad, undoubted power over immigration and alien status rests, in part, on its constitutional power to&para;<br>“establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,” Art. I, §8, cl. 4, and on&para;<br>its inherent sovereign power to control and conduct foreign relations,&para;<br>see Toll v. Moreno, 458 U. S. 1, 10. Federal governance is extensive&para;<br>and complex. Among other things, federal law specifies categories of&para;<br>aliens who are ineligible to be admitted to the United States, 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §1182; requires aliens to register with the Federal Government and to carry proof of status, §§1304(e), 1306(a); imposes sanctions on employers who hire unauthorized workers, §1324a; and specifies which aliens may be removed and the procedures for doing so,&para;<br>see §1227. Removal is a civil matter, and one of its principal features&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials, who must&para;<br>decide whether to pursue removal at all. Immigration and Customs&para;<br>Enforcement (ICE), an agency within the Department of Homeland&para;<br>Security, is responsible for identifying, apprehending, and removing&para;<br>illegal aliens. It also operates the Law Enforcement Support Center,&para;<br>which provides immigration status information to federal, state, and&para;<br>local officials around the clock. Pp. 2–7.&para;<br>2. The Supremacy Clause gives Congress the power to preempt&para;<br>state law. A statute may contain an express preemption provision,&para;<br>see, e.g., Chamber of Commerce of United States of America v. Whiting, 563 U. S. ___, ___, but state law must also give way to federal&para;<br>law in at least two other circumstances. First, States are precluded&para;<br>from regulating conduct in a field that Congress has determined&para;<br>must be regulated by its exclusive governance. See Gade v. National&para;<br>Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 115. Intent can be inferred from a framework of regulation “so pervasive . . . that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it” or where a “federal&para;<br>interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to&para;<br>preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.” Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230. Second, state laws are&para;<br>preempted when they conflict with federal law, including when they&para;<br>stand “as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full&para;<br>purposes and objectives of Congress.” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S.&para;<br>52, 67. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>3. Sections 3, 5(C), and 6 of S. B. 1070 are preempted by federal&para;<br>law. Pp. 8–19.&para;<br>(a) Section 3 intrudes on the field of alien registration, a field in&para;<br>which Congress has left no room for States to regulate. In Hines, a&para;<br>state alien-registration program was struck down on the ground that&para;<br>Congress intended its “complete” federal registration plan to be a&para;<br>“single integrated and all-embracing system.” 312 U. S., at 74. That&para;<br>scheme did not allow the States to “curtail or complement” federal&para;<br>law or “enforce additional or auxiliary regulations.” Id., at 66–67.&para;<br>The federal registration framework remains comprehensive. Because&para;<br>Congress has occupied the field, even complementary state regulation&para;<br>is impermissible. Pp. 8–11.&para;<br>(b) Section 5(C)’s criminal penalty stands as an obstacle to the&para;<br>federal regulatory system. The Immigration Reform and Control Act&para;<br>of 1986 (IRCA), a comprehensive framework for “combating the employment of illegal aliens,” Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v.&para;<br>NLRB, 535 U. S. 137, 147, makes it illegal for employers to knowingly hire, recruit, refer, or continue to employ unauthorized workers, 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §§1324a(a)(1)(A), (a)(2), and requires employers to verify prospective&para;<br>employees’&para;<br>employment&para;<br>authorization&para;<br>status,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>§§1324a(a)(1)(B), (b). It imposes criminal and civil penalties on employers, §§1324a(e)(4), (f), but only civil penalties on aliens who seek,&para;<br>or engage in, unauthorized employment, e.g., §§1255(c)(2), (c)(8).&para;<br>IRCA’s express preemption provision, though silent about whether&para;<br>additional penalties may be imposed against employees, “does not bar&para;<br>the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles” or impose a&para;<br>“special burden” making it more difficult to establish the preemption&para;<br>of laws falling outside the clause. Geier v. American Honda Motor&para;<br>Co., 529 U. S. 861, 869–872. The correct instruction to draw from the&para;<br>text, structure, and history of IRCA is that Congress decided it would&para;<br>be inappropriate to impose criminal penalties on unauthorized employees. It follows that a state law to the contrary is an obstacle to&para;<br>the regulatory system Congress chose. Pp. 12–15.&para;<br>(c) By authorizing state and local officers to make warrantless&para;<br>arrests of certain aliens suspected of being removable, §6 too creates&para;<br>an obstacle to federal law. As a general rule, it is not a crime for a&para;<br>removable alien to remain in the United States. The federal scheme&para;<br>instructs when it is appropriate to arrest an alien during the removal&para;<br>process. The Attorney General in some circumstances will issue a&para;<br>warrant for trained federal immigration officers to execute. If no federal warrant has been issued, these officers have more limited authority. They may arrest an alien for being “in the United States in&para;<br>violation of any [immigration] law or regulation,” for example, but only where the alien “is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained.” §1357(a)(2). Section 6 attempts to provide state officers with&para;<br>even greater arrest authority, which they could exercise with no instruction from the Federal Government. This is not the system Congress created. Federal law specifies limited circumstances in which&para;<br>state officers may perform an immigration officer’s functions. This&para;<br>includes instances where the Attorney General has granted that authority in a formal agreement with a state or local government. See,&para;<br>e.g., §1357(g)(1). Although federal law permits state officers to “cooperate with the Attorney General in the identification, apprehension,&para;<br>detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United&para;<br>States,” §1357(g)(10)(B), this does not encompass the unilateral decision to detain authorized by §6. Pp. 15–19.&para;<br>4. It was improper to enjoin §2(B) before the state courts had an&para;<br>opportunity to construe it and without some showing that §2(B)’s enforcement in fact conflicts with federal immigration law and its objectives. Pp. 19–24.&para;<br>(a) The state provision has three limitations: A detainee is presumed not to be an illegal alien if he or she provides a valid Arizona&para;<br>driver’s license or similar identification; officers may not consider&para;<br>race, color, or national origin “except to the extent permitted by the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>United States [and] Arizona Constitution[s]”; and §2(B) must be “implemented in a manner consistent with federal law regulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all persons and respecting the&para;<br>privileges and immunities of United States citizens.” P. 20.&para;<br>(b) This Court finds unpersuasive the argument that, even with&para;<br>those limits, §2(B) must be held preempted at this stage. Pp. 20–24.&para;<br>(1) The mandatory nature of the status checks does not interfere with the federal immigration scheme. Consultation between federal and state officials is an important feature of the immigration&para;<br>system. In fact, Congress has encouraged the sharing of information&para;<br>about possible immigration violations. See §§1357(g)(10)(A), 1373(c).&para;<br>The federal scheme thus leaves room for a policy requiring state officials to contact ICE as a routine matter. Cf. Whiting, 563 U. S., at&para;<br>___. Pp. 20–21.&para;<br>(2) It is not clear at this stage and on this record that §2(B), in&para;<br>practice, will require state officers to delay the release of detainees&para;<br>for no reason other than to verify their immigration status. This&para;<br>would raise constitutional concerns. And it would disrupt the federal&para;<br>framework to put state officers in the position of holding aliens in&para;<br>custody for possible unlawful presence without federal direction and&para;<br>supervision. But §2(B) could be read to avoid these concerns. If the&para;<br>law only requires state officers to conduct a status check during the&para;<br>course of an authorized, lawful detention or after a detainee has been&para;<br>released, the provision would likely survive preemption—at least absent some showing that it has other consequences that are adverse to&para;<br>federal law and its objectives. Without the benefit of a definitive interpretation from the state courts, it would be inappropriate to assume §2(B) will be construed in a way that conflicts with federal law.&para;<br>Cf. Fox v. Washington, 236 U. S. 273, 277. This opinion does not&para;<br>foreclose other preemption and constitutional challenges to the law&para;<br>as interpreted and applied after it goes into effect.

The law is often referred to as&para;<br>S. B. 1070, the version introduced in the state senate. See&para;<br>also H. 2162 (2010) (amending S. 1070). Its stated pur­&para;<br>pose is to “discourage and deter the unlawful entry and&para;<br>presence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlaw­&para;<br>fully present in the United States.” Note following Ariz.&para;<br>Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051 (West 2012). The law’s provi­&para;<br>sions establish an official state policy of “attrition through&para;<br>enforcement.” Ibid. The question before the Court is&para;<br>whether federal law preempts and renders invalid four&para;<br>separate provisions of the state law.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The United States filed this suit against Arizona, seek­&para;<br>ing to enjoin S. B. 1070 as preempted. Four provisions of&para;<br>the law are at issue here. Two create new state offenses.&para;<br>Section 3 makes failure to comply with federal alien­&para;<br>registration requirements a state misdemeanor. Ariz.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–1509 (West Supp. 2011). Section 5, in&para;<br>relevant part, makes it a misdemeanor for an unauthor­&para;<br>ized alien to seek or engage in work in the State; this&para;<br>provision is referred to as §5(C). See §13–2928(C). Two&para;<br>other provisions give specific arrest authority and investigative duties with respect to certain aliens to state and&para;<br>local law enforcement officers. Section 6 authorizes offic­&para;<br>ers to arrest without a warrant a person “the officer has&para;<br>probable cause to believe . . . has committed any public&para;<br>offense that makes the person removable from the United&para;<br>States.” §13–3883(A)(5). Section 2(B) provides that offic­&para;<br>ers who conduct a stop, detention, or arrest must in some&para;<br>circumstances make efforts to verify the person’s immi­&para;<br>gration status with the Federal Government. See §11–&para;<br>1051(B) (West 2012).&para;<br>The United States District Court for the District of&para;<br>Arizona issued a preliminary injunction preventing the&para;<br>four provisions at issue from taking effect. 703 F. Supp.&para;<br>2d 980, 1008 (2010). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit affirmed. 641 F. 3d 339, 366 (2011). It agreed that&para;<br>the United States had established a likelihood of success&para;<br>on its preemption claims. The Court of Appeals was unan­&para;<br>imous in its conclusion that §§3 and 5(C) were likely&para;<br>preempted. Judge Bea dissented from the decision to&para;<br>uphold the preliminary injunction against §§2(B) and 6.&para;<br>This Court granted certiorari to resolve important ques­&para;<br>tions concerning the interaction of state and federal power&para;<br>with respect to the law of immigration and alien status.&para;<br>565 U. S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Government of the United States has broad, un­&para;<br>doubted power over the subject of immigration and the&para;<br>status of aliens. See Toll v. Moreno, 458 U. S. 1, 10 (1982);&para;<br>see generally S. Legomsky &amp; C. Rodríguez, Immigration&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and Refugee Law and Policy 115–132 (5th ed. 2009). This&para;<br>authority rests, in part, on the National Government’s&para;<br>constitutional power to “establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,” U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 4, and its inherent power as sovereign to control and conduct relations&para;<br>with foreign nations, see Toll, supra, at 10 (citing United&para;<br>States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 318&para;<br>(1936)).&para;<br>The federal power to determine immigration policy is&para;<br>well settled. Immigration policy can affect trade, invest­&para;<br>ment, tourism, and diplomatic relations for the entire&para;<br>Nation, as well as the perceptions and expectations of&para;<br>aliens in this country who seek the full protection of its&para;<br>laws. See, e.g., Brief for Argentina et al. as Amici Curiae;&para;<br>see also Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U. S. 580,&para;<br>588–589 (1952). Perceived mistreatment of aliens in the&para;<br>United States may lead to harmful reciprocal treatment&para;<br>of American citizens abroad. See Brief for Madeleine K.&para;<br>Albright et al. as Amici Curiae 24–30.&para;<br>It is fundamental that foreign countries concerned about&para;<br>the status, safety, and security of their nationals in the&para;<br>United States must be able to confer and communicate on&para;<br>this subject with one national sovereign, not the 50 sepa­&para;<br>rate States. See Chy Lung v. Freeman, 92 U. S. 275, 279–&para;<br>280 (1876); see also The Federalist No. 3, p. 39 (C. Rossiter&para;<br>ed. 2003) (J. Jay) (observing that federal power would be&para;<br>necessary in part because “bordering States . . . under the&para;<br>impulse of sudden irritation, and a quick sense of appar­&para;<br>ent interest or injury” might take action that would un­&para;<br>dermine foreign relations). This Court has reaffirmed that&para;<br>“[o]ne of the most important and delicate of all interna­&para;<br>tional relationships . . . has to do with the protection of the&para;<br>just rights of a country’s own nationals when those na­&para;<br>tionals are in another country.” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312&para;<br>U. S. 52, 64 (1941).&para;<br>Federal governance of immigration and alien status is&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>extensive and complex. Congress has specified catego­&para;<br>ries of aliens who may not be admitted to the United&para;<br>States. See 8 U. S. C. §1182. Unlawful entry and unlawful&para;<br>reentry into the country are federal offenses. §§1325,&para;<br>1326. Once here, aliens are required to register with the&para;<br>Federal Government and to carry proof of status on their&para;<br>person. See §§1301–1306. Failure to do so is a federal&para;<br>misdemeanor. §§1304(e), 1306(a). Federal law also au­&para;<br>thorizes States to deny noncitizens a range of public bene­&para;<br>fits, §1622; and it imposes sanctions on employers who&para;<br>hire unauthorized workers, §1324a.&para;<br>Congress has specified which aliens may be removed&para;<br>from the United States and the procedures for doing so.&para;<br>Aliens may be removed if they were inadmissible at the&para;<br>time of entry, have been convicted of certain crimes, or&para;<br>meet other criteria set by federal law. See §1227. Re­&para;<br>moval is a civil, not criminal, matter. A principal feature of&para;<br>the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by&para;<br>immigration officials. See Brief for Former Commission­&para;<br>ers of the United States Immigration and Naturalization&para;<br>Service as Amici Curiae 8–13 (hereinafter Brief for For­&para;<br>mer INS Commissioners). Federal officials, as an initial&para;<br>matter, must decide whether it makes sense to pursue&para;<br>removal at all. If removal proceedings commence, aliens&para;<br>may seek asylum and other discretionary relief allowing&para;<br>them to remain in the country or at least to leave without&para;<br>formal removal. See §1229a(c)(4); see also, e.g., §§1158&para;<br>(asylum), 1229b (cancellation of removal), 1229c (volun­&para;<br>tary departure).&para;<br>Discretion in the enforcement of immigration law em­&para;<br>braces immediate human concerns. Unauthorized work­&para;<br>ers trying to support their families, for example, likely&para;<br>pose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who com­&para;<br>mit a serious crime. The equities of an individual case&para;<br>may turn on many factors, including whether the alien&para;<br>has children born in the United States, long ties to the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>community, or a record of distinguished military service.&para;<br>Some discretionary decisions involve policy choices that&para;<br>bear on this Nation’s international relations. Returning&para;<br>an alien to his own country may be deemed inappropriate&para;<br>even where he has committed a removable offense or fails&para;<br>to meet the criteria for admission. The foreign state may&para;<br>be mired in civil war, complicit in political persecution, or&para;<br>enduring conditions that create a real risk that the alien&para;<br>or his family will be harmed upon return. The dynamic&para;<br>nature of relations with other countries requires the Exec­&para;<br>utive Branch to ensure that enforcement policies are con­&para;<br>sistent with this Nation’s foreign policy with respect to&para;<br>these and other realities.&para;<br>Agencies in the Department of Homeland Security play&para;<br>a major role in enforcing the country’s immigration laws.&para;<br>United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for determining the admissibility of aliens and&para;<br>securing the country’s borders. See Dept. of Homeland&para;<br>Security, Office of Immigration Statistics, Immigration&para;<br>Enforcement Actions: 2010, p. 1 (2011). In 2010, CBP’s&para;<br>Border Patrol apprehended almost half a million people.&para;<br>Id., at 3. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a&para;<br>second agency, “conducts criminal investigations involving&para;<br>the enforcement of immigration-related statutes.” Id., at&para;<br>2. ICE also operates the Law Enforcement Support Cen­&para;<br>ter. LESC, as the Center is known, provides immigration status information to federal, state, and local officials&para;<br>around the clock. See App. 91.

Dept. of Homeland&para;<br>Security, Office of Immigration Statistics, 2010 Yearbook&para;<br>of Immigration Statistics 93 (2011) (Table 35). Unauthor­&para;<br>ized aliens who remain in the State comprise, by one estimate, almost six percent of the population. See Passel&para;<br>&amp; Cohn, Pew Hispanic Center, U. S. Unauthorized Immigration Flows Are Down Sharply Since Mid-Decade 3&para;<br>(2010). And in the State’s most populous county, these&para;<br>aliens are reported to be responsible for a disproportionate&para;<br>share of serious crime. See, e.g., Camarota &amp; Vaughan,&para;<br>Center for Immigration Studies, Immigration and Crime:&para;<br>Assessing a Conflicted Situation 16 (2009) (Table 3) (esti­&para;<br>mating that unauthorized aliens comprise 8.9% of the&para;<br>population and are responsible for 21.8% of the felonies in&para;<br>Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix).&para;<br>Statistics alone do not capture the full extent of Arizo­&para;<br>na’s concerns.

The problems&para;<br>posed to the State by illegal immigration must not be&para;<br>underestimated.&para;<br>These concerns are the background for the formal legal&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>analysis that follows. The issue is whether, under pre­&para;<br>emption principles, federal law permits Arizona to imple­&para;<br>ment the state-law provisions in dispute.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Federalism, central to the constitutional design, adopts&para;<br>the principle that both the National and State Govern­&para;<br>ments have elements of sovereignty the other is bound to&para;<br>respect. See Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 457&para;<br>(1991); U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779,&para;<br>838 (1995) (KENNEDY, J., concurring). From the existence&para;<br>of two sovereigns follows the possibility that laws can be&para;<br>in conflict or at cross-purposes. The Supremacy Clause&para;<br>provides a clear rule that federal law “shall be the su­&para;<br>preme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State&para;<br>shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or&para;<br>Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.”&para;<br>Art. VI, cl. 2. Under this principle, Congress has the&para;<br>power to preempt state law. See Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372 (2000); Gibbons&para;<br>v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 210–211 (1824). There is no doubt&para;<br>that Congress may withdraw specified powers from the&para;<br>States by enacting a statute containing an express&para;<br>preemption provision. See, e.g., Chamber of Commerce of&para;<br>United States of America v. Whiting, 563 U.

See Brief for United States 27, 31.&para;<br>The Court discussed federal alien-registration require­&para;<br>ments in Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52. In 1940, as&para;<br>international conflict spread, Congress added to federal&para;<br>immigration law a “complete system for alien registra­&para;<br>tion.” Id., at 70. The new federal law struck a careful&para;<br>balance. It punished an alien’s willful failure to register&para;<br>but did not require aliens to carry identification cards.&para;<br>There were also limits on the sharing of registration rec­&para;<br>ords and fingerprints. The Court found that Congress&para;<br>intended the federal plan for registration to be a “single&para;<br>integrated and all-embracing system.” Id., at 74. Because&para;<br>this “complete scheme . . . for the registration of aliens”&para;<br>touched on foreign relations, it did not allow the States to&para;<br>“curtail or complement” federal law or to “enforce addi­&para;<br>tional or auxiliary regulations.” Id., at 66–67. As a con­&para;<br>sequence, the Court ruled that Pennsylvania could not&para;<br>enforce its own alien-registration program. See id., at 59, 74.&para;<br>The present regime of federal regulation is not identi­&para;<br>cal to the statutory framework considered in Hines, but&para;<br>it remains comprehensive. Federal law now includes a&para;<br>requirement that aliens carry proof of registration. 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §1304(e). Other aspects, however, have stayed the&para;<br>same. Aliens who remain in the country for more than 30&para;<br>days must apply for registration and be fingerprinted.&para;<br>Compare §1302(a) with id., §452(a) (1940 ed.). Detailed&para;<br>information is required, and any change of address has&para;<br>to be reported to the Federal Government. Compare&para;<br>§§1304(a), 1305(a) (2006 ed.), with id., §§455(a), 456 (1940&para;<br>ed.). The statute continues to provide penalties for the&para;<br>willful failure to register. Compare §1306(a) (2006 ed.),&para;<br>with id., §457 (1940 ed.).&para;<br>The framework enacted by Congress leads to the conclu­&para;<br>sion here, as it did in Hines, that the Federal Government&para;<br>has occupied the field of alien registration. See American&para;<br>Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 419, n. 11 (2003)&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v.

The federal statu­&para;<br>tory directives provide a full set of standards governing&para;<br>alien registration, including the punishment for noncom­&para;<br>pliance. It was designed as a “ ‘harmonious whole.’ ”&para;<br>Hines, supra, at 72. Where Congress occupies an entire&para;<br>field, as it has in the field of alien registration, even com­&para;<br>plementary state regulation is impermissible. Field pre­&para;<br>emption reflects a congressional decision to foreclose any&para;<br>state regulation in the area, even if it is parallel to federal standards. See Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464&para;<br>U. S. 238, 249 (1984).&para;<br>Federal law makes a single sovereign responsible for&para;<br>maintaining a comprehensive and unified system to keep&para;<br>track of aliens within the Nation’s borders. If §3 of the&para;<br>Arizona statute were valid, every State could give itself&para;<br>independent authority to prosecute federal registration&para;<br>violations, “diminish[ing] the [Federal Government]’s control&para;<br>over enforcement” and “detract[ing] from the ‘integrated&para;<br>scheme of regulation’ created by Congress.” Wisconsin&para;<br>Dept. of Industry v. Gould Inc., 475 U. S. 282, 288–289&para;<br>(1986). Even if a State may make violation of federal&para;<br>law a crime in some instances, it cannot do so in a field&para;<br>(like the field of alien registration) that has been occupied&para;<br>by federal law. See California v. Zook, 336 U. S. 725, 730–&para;<br>731, 733 (1949); see also In re Loney, 134 U. S. 372, 375–&para;<br>376 (1890) (States may not impose their own punishment&para;<br>for perjury in federal courts).&para;<br>Arizona contends that §3 can survive preemption be­&para;<br>cause the provision has the same aim as federal law and&para;<br>adopts its substantive standards. This argument not only&para;<br>ignores the basic premise of field preemption—that States&para;<br>may not enter, in any respect, an area the Federal Gov­&para;<br>ernment has reserved for itself—but also is unpersuasive&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>on its own terms. Permitting the State to impose its own&para;<br>penalties for the federal offenses here would conflict with&para;<br>the careful framework Congress adopted. Cf. Buckman&para;<br>Co. v.

Were §3 to come into force, the State&para;<br>would have the power to bring criminal charges against&para;<br>individuals for violating a federal law even in circum­&para;<br>stances where federal officials in charge of the comprehen­&para;<br>sive scheme determine that prosecution would frustrate&para;<br>federal policies.&para;<br>There is a further intrusion upon the federal scheme.&para;<br>Even where federal authorities believe prosecution is appropriate, there is an inconsistency between §3 and federal law with respect to penalties. Under federal law,&para;<br>the failure to carry registration papers is a misdemeanor&para;<br>that may be punished by a fine, imprisonment, or a term&para;<br>of probation. See 8 U. S. C. §1304(e) (2006 ed.); 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§3561. State law, by contrast, rules out probation as a&para;<br>possible sentence (and also eliminates the possibility of&para;<br>a pardon). See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–1509(D) (West&para;<br>Supp. 2011). This state framework of sanctions creates a&para;<br>conflict with the plan Congress put in place. See Wisconsin Dept., supra, at 286 (“[C]onflict is imminent whenever&para;<br>two separate remedies are brought to bear on the same&para;<br>activity” (internal quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>These specific conflicts between state and federal law&para;<br>simply underscore the reason for field preemption. As it&para;<br>did in Hines, the Court now concludes that, with respect&para;<br>to the subject of alien registration, Congress intended to&para;<br>preclude States from “complement[ing] the federal law, or&para;<br>enforc[ing] additional or auxiliary regulations.” 312 U.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>Section 5(C)&para;<br>Unlike §3, which replicates federal statutory require­&para;<br>ments, §5(C) enacts a state criminal prohibition where no&para;<br>federal counterpart exists. The provision makes it a state&para;<br>misdemeanor for “an unauthorized alien to knowingly apply for work, solicit work in a public place or perform&para;<br>work as an employee or independent contractor” in Ari­&para;<br>zona. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–2928(C) (West Supp. 2011).&para;<br>Violations can be punished by a $2,500 fine and incarcera­&para;<br>tion for up to six months. See §13–2928(F); see also&para;<br>§§13–707(A)(1) (West 2010); 13–802(A); 13–902(A)(5). The&para;<br>United States contends that the provision upsets the balance struck by the Immigration Reform and Control Act&para;<br>of 1986 (IRCA) and must be preempted as an obstacle&para;<br>to the federal plan of regulation and control.&para;<br>When there was no comprehensive federal program&para;<br>regulating the employment of unauthorized aliens, this&para;<br>Court found that a State had authority to pass its own&para;<br>laws on the subject. In 1971, for example, California&para;<br>passed a law imposing civil penalties on the employment&para;<br>of aliens who were “not entitled to lawful residence in the&para;<br>United States if such employment would have an adverse&para;<br>effect on lawful resident workers.” 1971 Cal. Stats. ch.&para;<br>1442, §1(a). The law was upheld against a preemption&para;<br>challenge in De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S. 351 (1976). De&para;<br>Canas recognized that “States possess broad authority&para;<br>under their police powers to regulate the employment&para;<br>relationship to protect workers within the State.” Id., at&para;<br>356. At that point, however, the Federal Government had&para;<br>expressed no more than “a peripheral concern with [the]&para;<br>employment of illegal entrants.” Id., at 360; see Whiting,&para;<br>563 U.

S. 137, 147&para;<br>(2002). The law makes it illegal for employers to know­&para;<br>ingly hire, recruit, refer, or continue to employ unauthorized&para;<br>workers. See 8 U. S. C. §§1324a(a)(1)(A), (a)(2). It also&para;<br>requires every employer to verify the employment authori­&para;<br>zation status of prospective employees. See §§1324a(a)&para;<br>(1)(B), (b); 8 CFR §274a.2(b) (2012). These requirements&para;<br>are enforced through criminal penalties and an escalat­&para;<br>ing series of civil penalties tied to the number of times&para;<br>an employer has violated the provisions. See 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§1324a(e)(4), (f); 8 CFR §274a.10.&para;<br>This comprehensive framework does not impose federal&para;<br>criminal sanctions on the employee side (i.e., penalties on&para;<br>aliens who seek or engage in unauthorized work). Under&para;<br>federal law some civil penalties are imposed instead. With&para;<br>certain exceptions, aliens who accept unlawful employ­&para;<br>ment are not eligible to have their status adjusted to&para;<br>that of a lawful permanent resident. See 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§1255(c)(2), (c)(8). Aliens also may be removed from the&para;<br>country for having engaged in unauthorized work. See&para;<br>§1227(a)(1)(C)(i); 8 CFR §214.1(e). In addition to specify­&para;<br>ing these civil consequences, federal law makes it a crime&para;<br>for unauthorized workers to obtain employment through&para;<br>fraudulent means. See 18 U. S. C. §1546(b). Congress has&para;<br>made clear, however, that any information employees&para;<br>submit to indicate their work status “may not be used” for&para;<br>purposes other than prosecution under specified federal&para;<br>criminal statutes for fraud, perjury, and related conduct.&para;<br>See 8 U. S. C. §§1324a(b)(5), (d)(2)(F)–(G).&para;<br>The legislative background of IRCA underscores the fact&para;<br>that Congress made a deliberate choice not to impose crim­&para;<br>&para;<br>inal penalties on aliens who seek, or engage in, unauthor­&para;<br>ized employment. A commission established by Congress&para;<br>to study immigration policy and to make recommen­&para;<br>dations concluded these penalties would be “unnecessary&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v.

See, e.g., Hearings before the Subcommittee&para;<br>No. 1 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 92d Cong.,&para;<br>1st Sess., pt. 3, pp. 919–920 (1971) (statement of Rep.&para;<br>Rodino, the eventual sponsor of IRCA in the House of&para;<br>Representatives).&para;<br>IRCA’s express preemption provision, which in most&para;<br>instances bars States from imposing penalties on employ­&para;<br>ers of unauthorized aliens, is silent about whether addi­&para;<br>tional penalties may be imposed against the employees&para;<br>themselves. See 8 U. S. C. §1324a(h)(2); Whiting, supra,&para;<br>at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2). But the existence of an “ex­&para;<br>press pre-emption provisio[n] does not bar the ordinary&para;<br>working of conflict pre-emption principles” or impose a&para;<br>“special burden” that would make it more difficult to&para;<br>establish the preemption of laws falling outside the clause.&para;<br>Geier v.

Under §5(C) of S. B. 1070, Arizona&para;<br>law would interfere with the careful balance struck by&para;<br>Congress with respect to unauthorized employment of&para;<br>aliens. Although §5(C) attempts to achieve one of the&para;<br>same goals as federal law—the deterrence of unlawful&para;<br>employment—it involves a conflict in the method of en­&para;<br>forcement. The Court has recognized that a “[c]onflict&para;<br>in technique can be fully as disruptive to the system Con­&para;<br>gress enacted as conflict in overt policy.” Motor Coach&para;<br>Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274, 287 (1971). The&para;<br>correct instruction to draw from the text, structure, and&para;<br>history of IRCA is that Congress decided it would be inap­&para;<br>propriate to impose criminal penalties on aliens who seek&para;<br>or engage in unauthorized employment. It follows that a&para;<br>state law to the contrary is an obstacle to the regulatory&para;<br>system Congress chose. See Puerto Rico Dept. of Consumer Affairs v. ISLA Petroleum Corp., 485 U. S. 495, 503&para;<br>(1988) (“Where a comprehensive federal scheme intention­&para;<br>ally leaves a portion of the regulated field without con­&para;<br>trols, then the pre-emptive inference can be drawn—not&para;<br>from federal inaction alone, but from inaction joined with&para;<br>action”). Section 5(C) is preempted by federal law.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Section 6&para;<br>Section 6 of S.

The United States argues that arrests&para;<br>authorized by this statute would be an obstacle to the&para;<br>removal system Congress created.&para;<br>As a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien&para;<br>to remain present in the United States.

If the police stop&para;<br>someone based on nothing more than possible removabil­&para;<br>ity, the usual predicate for an arrest is absent. When an&para;<br>alien is suspected of being removable, a federal official&para;<br>issues an administrative document called a Notice to Ap­&para;<br>pear. See 8 U. S. C. §1229(a); 8 CFR §239.1(a) (2012).&para;<br>The form does not authorize an arrest. Instead, it gives&para;<br>the alien information about the proceedings, including the&para;<br>time and date of the removal hearing. See 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1229(a)(1). If an alien fails to appear, an in absentia&para;<br>order may direct removal. §1229a(5)(A).&para;<br>The federal statutory structure instructs when it is ap­&para;<br>propriate to arrest an alien during the removal process.&para;<br>For example, the Attorney General can exercise discretion&para;<br>to issue a warrant for an alien’s arrest and detention&para;<br>“pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed&para;<br>from the United States.” 8 U. S. C. §1226(a); see Memo­&para;<br>randum from John Morton, Director, ICE, to All Field&para;<br>Office Directors et al., Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion&para;<br>Consistent with the Civil Immigration Enforcement Prior­&para;<br>ities of the Agency for the Apprehension, Detention, and&para;<br>Removal of Aliens (June 17, 2011) (hereinafter 2011 ICE&para;<br>Memorandum) (describing factors informing this and re­&para;<br>lated decisions). And if an alien is ordered removed after&para;<br>a hearing, the Attorney General will issue a warrant.&para;<br>See 8 CFR §241.2(a)(1). In both instances, the warrants&para;<br>are executed by federal officers who have received training&para;<br>in the enforcement of immigration law. See §§241.2(b),&para;<br>287.5(e)(3). If no federal warrant has been issued, those&para;<br>officers have more limited authority. See 8 U. S.

S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>bility than Congress has given to trained federal immigration officers. Under state law, officers who believe&para;<br>an alien is removable by reason of some “public offense”&para;<br>would have the power to conduct an arrest on that basis&para;<br>regardless of whether a federal warrant has issued or&para;<br>the alien is likely to escape. This state authority could be&para;<br>exercised without any input from the Federal Government&para;<br>about whether an arrest is warranted in a particular case.&para;<br>This would allow the State to achieve its own immigra­&para;<br>tion policy. The result could be unnecessary harassment&para;<br>of some aliens (for instance, a veteran, college student, or&para;<br>someone assisting with a criminal investigation) whom&para;<br>federal officials determine should not be removed.&para;<br>This is not the system Congress created. Federal law&para;<br>specifies limited circumstances in which state officers may&para;<br>perform the functions of an immigration officer. A princi­&para;<br>pal example is when the Attorney General has granted&para;<br>that authority to specific officers in a formal agreement&para;<br>with a state or local government. See §1357(g)(1); see also&para;<br>§1103(a)(10) (authority may be extended in the event of an&para;<br>“imminent mass influx of aliens off the coast of the United&para;<br>States”); §1252c (authority to arrest in specific circum­&para;<br>stance after consultation with the Federal Government);&para;<br>§1324(c) (authority to arrest for bringing in and harboring&para;<br>certain aliens). Officers covered by these agreements are&para;<br>subject to the Attorney General’s direction and super­&para;<br>vision. §1357(g)(3). There are significant complexities&para;<br>involved in enforcing federal immigration law, including&para;<br>the determination whether a person is removable. See&para;<br>Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2010) (ALITO,&para;<br>J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 4–7). As a result,&para;<br>the agreements reached with the Attorney General must&para;<br>contain written certification that officers have received&para;<br>adequate training to carry out the duties of an immigra­&para;<br>tion officer. See §1357(g)(2); cf. 8 CFR §§287.5(c) (arrest power contingent on training), 287.1(g) (defining the&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>training).&para;<br>By authorizing state officers to decide whether an&para;<br>alien should be detained for being removable, §6 violates&para;<br>the principle that the removal process is entrusted to the&para;<br>discretion of the Federal Government. See, e.g., Reno v.&para;<br>American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U. S. 471,&para;<br>483–484 (1999); see also Brief for Former INS Commis­&para;<br>sioners 8–13. A decision on removability requires a de­&para;<br>termination whether it is appropriate to allow a foreign&para;<br>national to continue living in the United States.

State officials can also assist&para;<br>the Federal Government by responding to requests for&para;<br>information about when an alien will be released from&para;<br>their custody. See §1357(d). But the unilateral state&para;<br>action to detain authorized by §6 goes far beyond these&para;<br>measures, defeating any need for real cooperation.&para;<br>Congress has put in place a system in which state offic­&para;<br>ers may not make warrantless arrests of aliens based on&para;<br>possible removability except in specific, limited circum­&para;<br>stances.

The law also provides that “[a]ny person who is&para;<br>arrested shall have the person’s immigration status de­&para;<br>termined before the person is released.” Ibid.

Second, officers&para;<br>“may not consider race, color or national origin . . . except&para;<br>to the extent permitted by the United States [and] Ari­&para;<br>zona Constitution[s].” Ibid. Third, the provisions must&para;<br>be “implemented in a manner consistent with federal law&para;<br>regulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all&para;<br>persons and respecting the privileges and immunities of&para;<br>United States citizens.” §11–1051(L) (West 2012).&para;<br>The United States and its amici contend that, even with&para;<br>these limits, the State’s verification requirements pose an&para;<br>obstacle to the framework Congress put in place. The first&para;<br>concern is the mandatory nature of the status checks. The&para;<br>second is the possibility of prolonged detention while the&para;<br>checks are being performed.&para;<br>1&para;<br>Consultation between federal and state officials is an&para;<br>important feature of the immigration system. Congress&para;<br>has made clear that no formal agreement or special train­&para;<br>ing needs to be in place for state officers to “communicate&para;<br>with the [Federal Government] regarding the immigration&para;<br>status of any individual, including reporting knowledge&para;<br>that a particular alien is not lawfully present in the United&para;<br>States.” 8 U.

App. 93.&para;<br>The United States argues that making status verifica­&para;<br>tion mandatory interferes with the federal immigration&para;<br>scheme. It is true that §2(B) does not allow state officers&para;<br>to consider federal enforcement priorities in deciding&para;<br>whether to contact ICE about someone they have de­&para;<br>tained. See Brief for United States 47–50. In other words,&para;<br>the officers must make an inquiry even in cases where it&para;<br>seems unlikely that the Attorney General would have&para;<br>the alien removed. This might be the case, for example,&para;<br>when an alien is an elderly veteran with significant and&para;<br>longstanding ties to the community. See 2011 ICE Memo­&para;<br>randum 4–5 (mentioning these factors as relevant).&para;<br>Congress has done nothing to suggest it is inappropriate&para;<br>to communicate with ICE in these situations, however.&para;<br>Indeed, it has encouraged the sharing of information about&para;<br>possible immigration violations. See 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)&para;<br>(10)(A). A federal statute regulating the public benefits&para;<br>provided to qualified aliens in fact instructs that “no State&para;<br>or local government entity may be prohibited, or in any&para;<br>way restricted, from sending to or receiving from [ICE]&para;<br>information regarding the immigration status, lawful or&para;<br>unlawful, of an alien in the United States.” §1644. The&para;<br>federal scheme thus leaves room for a policy requiring&para;<br>state officials to contact ICE as a routine matter. Cf.&para;<br>Whiting, 563 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 23–24) (reject­&para;<br>ing argument that federal law preempted Arizona’s re­&para;<br>quirement that employers determine whether employees&para;<br>were eligible to work through the federal E-Verify system&para;<br>where the Federal Government had encouraged its use).&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>Some who support the challenge to §2(B) argue that, in&para;<br>practice, state officers will be required to delay the release&para;<br>of some detainees for no reason other than to verify their&para;<br>immigration status. See, e.g., Brief for Former Arizona&para;<br>Attorney General Terry Goddard et al. as Amici Curiae 37,&para;<br>n. 49. Detaining individuals solely to verify their immi­&para;<br>gration status would raise constitutional concerns. See,&para;<br>e.g., Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U. S. 323, 333 (2009); Illinois&para;<br>v. Caballes, 543 U. S. 405, 407 (2005) (“A seizure that is&para;<br>justified solely by the interest in issuing a warning ticket&para;<br>to the driver can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond&para;<br>the time reasonably required to complete that mission”).&para;<br>And it would disrupt the federal framework to put state&para;<br>officers in the position of holding aliens in custody for&para;<br>possible unlawful presence without federal direction and&para;<br>supervision. Cf. Part IV–C, supra (concluding that Ari­&para;<br>zona may not authorize warrantless arrests on the basis of&para;<br>removability). The program put in place by Congress does&para;<br>not allow state or local officers to adopt this enforcement&para;<br>mechanism.&para;<br>But §2(B) could be read to avoid these concerns. To take&para;<br>one example, a person might be stopped for jaywalking in&para;<br>Tucson and be unable to produce identification. The first&para;<br>sentence of §2(B) instructs officers to make a “reasonable”&para;<br>attempt to verify his immigration status with ICE if there&para;<br>is reasonable suspicion that his presence in the United&para;<br>States is unlawful. The state courts may conclude that,&para;<br>unless the person continues to be suspected of some crime&para;<br>for which he may be detained by state officers, it would&para;<br>not be reasonable to prolong the stop for the immigration&para;<br>inquiry. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 12, n. 4 (“[Section&para;<br>2(B)] does not require the verification be completed during&para;<br>the stop or detention if that is not reasonable or practica­&para;<br>ble”); cf. Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93, 101 (2005) (finding&para;<br>no Fourth Amendment violation where questioning about&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>immigration status did not prolong a stop).&para;<br>To take another example, a person might be held pend­&para;<br>ing release on a charge of driving under the influence of&para;<br>alcohol. As this goes beyond a mere stop, the arrestee&para;<br>(unlike the jaywalker) would appear to be subject to the&para;<br>categorical requirement in the second sentence of §2(B)&para;<br>that “[a]ny person who is arrested shall have the person’s&para;<br>immigration status determined before [he] is released.”&para;<br>State courts may read this as an instruction to initiate a&para;<br>status check every time someone is arrested, or in some&para;<br>subset of those cases, rather than as a command to hold&para;<br>the person until the check is complete no matter the cir­&para;<br>cumstances. Even if the law is read as an instruction to&para;<br>complete a check while the person is in custody, moreover,&para;<br>it is not clear at this stage and on this record that the&para;<br>verification process would result in prolonged detention.&para;<br>However the law is interpreted, if §2(B) only requires&para;<br>state officers to conduct a status check during the course&para;<br>of an authorized, lawful detention or after a detainee has&para;<br>been released, the provision likely would survive preemption—at least absent some showing that it has other&para;<br>consequences that are adverse to federal law and its objec­&para;<br>tives. There is no need in this case to address whether&para;<br>reasonable suspicion of illegal entry or another immigra­&para;<br>tion crime would be a legitimate basis for prolonging a&para;<br>detention, or whether this too would be preempted by&para;<br>federal law. See, e.g., United States v. Di Re, 332 U.

Miln, this Court considered&para;<br>a New York statute that required the commander of any&para;<br>ship arriving in New York from abroad to disclose “the&para;<br>name, place of birth, and last legal settlement, age and&para;<br>occupation . . . of all passengers . . . with the intention of&para;<br>proceeding to the said city.” 11 Pet., at 130–131. After&para;<br>discussing the sovereign authority to regulate the en­&para;<br>trance of foreigners described by De Vattel, the Court said:&para;<br>“The power . . . of New York to pass this law having&para;<br>undeniably existed at the formation of the constitu­&para;<br>tion, the simply inquiry is, whether by that instru­&para;<br>ment it was taken from the states, and granted to&para;<br>congress; for if it were not, it yet remains with them.”&para;<br>Id., at 132.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>And the Court held that it remains. Id., at 139.&para;<br>II&para;<br>One would conclude from the foregoing that after the&para;<br>adoption of the Constitution there was some doubt about&para;<br>the power of the Federal Government to control immigra­&para;<br>tion, but no doubt about the power of the States to do so.&para;<br>Since the founding era (though not immediately), doubt&para;<br>about the Federal Government’s power has disappeared.&para;<br>Indeed, primary responsibility for immigration policy has&para;<br>shifted from the States to the Federal Government. Con­&para;<br>gress exercised its power “[t]o establish an uniform Rule of&para;<br>Naturalization,” Art. I, §8, cl. 4, very early on, see An Act&para;<br>to establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, 1 Stat.&para;<br>103. But with the fleeting exception of the Alien Act,&para;<br>Congress did not enact any legislation regulating immi­&para;<br>gration for the better part of a century. In 1862, Congress&para;<br>passed “An Act to prohibit the ‘Coolie Trade’ by American&para;<br>Citizens in American Vessels,” which prohibited “procur­&para;<br>ing [Chinese nationals] . . . to be disposed of, or sold, or&para;<br>transferred, for any term of years or for any time what­&para;<br>ever, as servants or apprentices, or to be held to service or&para;<br>labor.” 12 Stat. 340. Then, in 1875, Congress amended&para;<br>that act to bar admission to Chinese, Japanese, and other&para;<br>Asian immigrants who had “entered into a contract or&para;<br>agreement for a term of service within the United States,&para;<br>for lewd and immoral purposes.” An act supplementary to&para;<br>the acts in relation to immigration, ch. 141, 18 Stat. 477.&para;<br>And in 1882, Congress enacted the first general immi­&para;<br>gration statute. See An act to regulate Immigration, 22&para;<br>Stat. 214. Of course, it hardly bears mention that Federal&para;<br>immigration law is now extensive.&para;<br>I accept that as a valid exercise of federal power—not&para;<br>because of the Naturalization Clause (it has no necessary&para;<br>connection to citizenship) but because it is an inherent&para;<br>attribute of sovereignty no less for the United States than&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>for the States. As this Court has said, it is an “ ‘accepted&para;<br>maxim of international law, that every sovereign nation&para;<br>has the power, as inherent in sovereignty, and essential to&para;<br>self-preservation, to forbid the entrance of foreigners&para;<br>within its dominions.’ ” Fong Yue Ting v. United States,&para;<br>149 U. S. 698, 705 (1893) (quoting Ekiu v. United States,&para;<br>142 U. S. 651, 659 (1892)). That is why there was no need&para;<br>to set forth control of immigration as one of the enumer­&para;<br>ated powers of Congress, although an acknowledgment of&para;<br>that power (as well as of the States’ similar power, subject&para;<br>to federal abridgment) was contained in Art. I, §9, which&para;<br>provided that “[t]he Migration or Importation of such&para;<br>Persons as any of the States now existing shall think&para;<br>proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress&para;<br>prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and&para;<br>eight . . . .”&para;<br>In light of the predominance of federal immigration&para;<br>restrictions in modern times, it is easy to lose sight of the&para;<br>States’ traditional role in regulating immigration—and to&para;<br>overlook their sovereign prerogative to do so. I accept as a&para;<br>given that State regulation is excluded by the Constitution&para;<br>when (1) it has been prohibited by a valid federal law, or&para;<br>(2) it conflicts with federal regulation—when, for example,&para;<br>it admits those whom federal regulation would exclude, or&para;<br>excludes those whom federal regulation would admit.&para;<br>Possibility (1) need not be considered here: there is no&para;<br>federal law prohibiting the States’ sovereign power to exclude (assuming federal authority to enact such a law).&para;<br>The mere existence of federal action in the immigration&para;<br>area—and the so-called field preemption arising from that&para;<br>action, upon which the Court’s opinion so heavily relies,&para;<br>ante, at 9–11—cannot be regarded as such a prohibition.&para;<br>We are not talking here about a federal law prohibiting&para;<br>the States from regulating bubble-gum advertising, or&para;<br>even the construction of nuclear plants. We are talking&para;<br>about a federal law going to the core of state sovereignty:&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>the power to exclude. Like elimination of the States’ other&para;<br>inherent sovereign power, immunity from suit, elimination of the States’ sovereign power to exclude requires that&para;<br>“Congress . . . unequivocally expres[s] its intent to abro­&para;<br>gate,” Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 55&para;<br>(1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).&para;<br>Implicit “field preemption” will not do.&para;<br>Nor can federal power over illegal immigration be&para;<br>deemed exclusive because of what the Court’s opinion&para;<br>solicitously calls “foreign countries[ ’] concern[s] about the&para;<br>status, safety, and security of their nationals in the United&para;<br>States,” ante, at 3. The Constitution gives all those on our&para;<br>shores the protections of the Bill of Rights—but just as&para;<br>those rights are not expanded for foreign nationals be­&para;<br>cause of their countries’ views (some countries, for exam­&para;<br>ple, have recently discovered the death penalty to be&para;<br>barbaric), neither are the fundamental sovereign powers&para;<br>of the States abridged to accommodate foreign countries’&para;<br>views. Even in its international relations, the Federal&para;<br>Government must live with the inconvenient fact that it is&para;<br>a Union of independent States, who have their own sover­&para;<br>eign powers. This is not the first time it has found that a&para;<br>nuisance and a bother in the conduct of foreign policy.&para;<br>Four years ago, for example, the Government importuned&para;<br>us to interfere with thoroughly constitutional state judicial&para;<br>procedures in the criminal trial of foreign nationals be­&para;<br>cause the international community, and even an opinion of&para;<br>the International Court of Justice, disapproved them. See&para;<br>Medellín v. Texas, 552 U. S. 491 (2008). We rejected that&para;<br>request, as we should reject the Executive’s invocation of&para;<br>foreign-affairs considerations here. Though it may upset&para;<br>foreign powers—and even when the Federal Government&para;<br>desperately wants to avoid upsetting foreign powers—the&para;<br>States have the right to protect their borders against&para;<br>foreign nationals, just as they have the right to execute&para;<br>foreign nationals for murder.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>What this case comes down to, then, is whether the&para;<br>Arizona law conflicts with federal immigration law—&para;<br>whether it excludes those whom federal law would admit,&para;<br>or admits those whom federal law would exclude. It does&para;<br>not purport to do so. It applies only to aliens who neither&para;<br>possess a privilege to be present under federal law nor&para;<br>have been removed pursuant to the Federal Government’s&para;<br>inherent authority. I proceed to consider the challenged&para;<br>provisions in detail.&para;<br>§2(B)&para;<br>“For any lawful stop, detention or arrest made by a&para;<br>law enforcement official . . . in the enforcement of any&para;<br>other law or ordinance of a county, city or town or this&para;<br>state where reasonable suspicion exists that the per­&para;<br>son is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United&para;<br>States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when&para;<br>practicable, to determine the immigration status of&para;<br>the person, except if the determination may hinder or&para;<br>obstruct an investigation. Any person who is arrested&para;<br>shall have the person’s immigration status deter­&para;<br>mined before the person is released. . . .” S. B. 1070,&para;<br>§2(B), as amended, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051(B)&para;<br>(West 2012).&para;<br>The Government has conceded that “even before Section&para;<br>2 was enacted, state and local officers had state-law au­&para;<br>thority to inquire of DHS [the Department of Homeland&para;<br>Security] about a suspect’s unlawful status and otherwise cooperate with federal immigration officers.” Brief for&para;<br>United States 47 (citing App. 62, 82); see also Brief for&para;<br>United States 48–49. That concession, in my view, obviates the need for further inquiry. The Government’s&para;<br>conflict-pre-emption claim calls on us “to determine&para;<br>whether, under the circumstances of this particular case,&para;<br>[the State’s] law stands as an obstacle to the accomplish­&para;<br>ment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress.” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941)&para;<br>(emphasis added). It is impossible to make such a finding&para;<br>without a factual record concerning the manner in which&para;<br>Arizona is implementing these provisions—something the&para;<br>Government’s pre-enforcement challenge has pretermitted.&para;<br>“The fact that [a law] might operate unconstitutionally&para;<br>under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid, since we have not&para;<br>recognized an ‘overbreadth’ doctrine outside the limited&para;<br>context of the First Amendment.” United States v. Sal­&para;<br>erno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). And on its face, §2(B)&para;<br>merely tells state officials that they are authorized to do&para;<br>something that they were, by the Government’s con­&para;<br>cession, already authorized to do.&para;<br>The Court therefore properly rejects the Government’s&para;<br>challenge, recognizing that, “[a]t this stage, without the&para;<br>benefit of a definitive interpretation from the state courts,&para;<br>it would be inappropriate to assume §2B will be construed&para;<br>in a way that creates a conflict with federal law.” Ante, at&para;<br>23. Before reaching that conclusion, however, the Court&para;<br>goes to great length to assuage fears that “state officers&para;<br>will be required to delay the release of some detainees for&para;<br>no reason other than to verify their immigration status.”&para;<br>Ante, at 22. Of course, any investigatory detention, in­&para;<br>cluding one under §2(B), may become an “unreasonable&para;<br>. . . seizur[e],” U. S. Const., Amdt. IV, if it lasts too long.&para;<br>See Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U. S. 405, 407 (2005). But&para;<br>that has nothing to do with this case, in which the Gov­&para;<br>ernment claims that §2(B) is pre-empted by federal immi­&para;<br>gration law, not that anyone’s Fourth Amendment rights&para;<br>have been violated. And I know of no reason why a&para;<br>protracted detention that does not violate the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment would contradict or conflict with any federal&para;<br>immigration law.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>§6&para;<br>“A peace officer, without a warrant, may arrest a per­&para;<br>son if the officer has probable cause to believe . . .&para;<br>[t]he person to be arrested has committed any public&para;<br>offense that makes the person removable from the&para;<br>United States.” S. B. 1070, §6(A)(5), Ariz. Rev. Stat.&para;<br>Ann. §13–3883(A)(5) (West Supp. 2011).&para;<br>This provision of S. B. 1070 expands the statutory list of&para;<br>offenses for which an Arizona police officer may make an&para;<br>arrest without a warrant. See §13–3883. If an officer has&para;<br>probable cause to believe that an individual is “removable”&para;<br>by reason of a public offense, then a warrant is not re­&para;<br>quired to make an arrest. The Government’s primary&para;<br>contention is that §6 is pre-empted by federal immigration&para;<br>law because it allows state officials to make arrests “with­&para;<br>out regard to federal priorities.” Brief for United States&para;<br>53. The Court’s opinion focuses on limits that Congress&para;<br>has placed on federal officials’ authority to arrest remov­&para;<br>able aliens and the possibility that state officials will&para;<br>make arrests “to achieve [Arizona’s] own immigration policy”&para;<br>and “without any input from the Federal Government.”&para;<br>Ante, at 17.&para;<br>Of course on this pre-enforcement record there is no&para;<br>reason to assume that Arizona officials will ignore federal&para;<br>immigration policy (unless it be the questionable policy of&para;<br>not wanting to identify illegal aliens who have committed&para;<br>offenses that make them removable). As Arizona points&para;<br>out, federal law expressly provides that state officers may&para;<br>“cooperate with the Attorney General in the identification,&para;<br>apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully&para;<br>present in the United States,” 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)(10)(B);&para;<br>and “cooperation” requires neither identical efforts nor&para;<br>prior federal approval. It is consistent with the Arizona&para;<br>statute, and with the “cooperat[ive]” system that Congress&para;<br>has created, for state officials to arrest a removable alien,&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>contact federal immigration authorities, and follow their&para;<br>lead on what to do next. And it is an assault on logic to&para;<br>say that identifying a removable alien and holding him for&para;<br>federal determination of whether he should be removed&para;<br>“violates the principle that the removal process is entrusted&para;<br>to the discretion of the Federal Government,” ante, at&para;<br>18. The State’s detention does not represent commence­&para;<br>ment of the removal process unless the Federal Govern­&para;<br>ment makes it so.&para;<br>But that is not the most important point. The most&para;<br>important point is that, as we have discussed, Arizona is&para;<br>entitled to have “its own immigration policy”—including a&para;<br>more rigorous enforcement policy—so long as that does not&para;<br>conflict with federal law. The Court says, as though the&para;<br>point is utterly dispositive, that “it is not a crime for a&para;<br>removable alien to remain present in the United States,”&para;<br>ante, at 15. It is not a federal crime, to be sure. But there&para;<br>is no reason Arizona cannot make it a state crime for a&para;<br>removable alien (or any illegal alien, for that matter) to&para;<br>remain present in Arizona.&para;<br>The Court quotes 8 U. S. C. §1226(a), which provides&para;<br>that, “[o]n a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an&para;<br>alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on&para;<br>whether the alien is to be removed from the United&para;<br>States.” Section 1357(a)(2) also provides that a federal&para;<br>immigration official “shall have power without warrant . . .&para;<br>to arrest any alien in the United States, if he has reason to&para;<br>believe that the alien so arrested is in the United States in&para;<br>violation of any [federal immigration] law or regulation&para;<br>and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for&para;<br>his arrest.” But statutory limitations upon the actions of&para;<br>federal officers in enforcing the United States’ power to&para;<br>protect its borders do not on their face apply to the actions&para;<br>of state officers in enforcing the State’s power to protect its&para;<br>borders. There is no more reason to read these provisions&para;<br>as implying that state officials are subject to similar limi­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>tations than there is to read them as implying that only&para;<br>federal officials may arrest removable aliens. And in any&para;<br>event neither implication would constitute the sort of clear&para;<br>elimination of the States’ sovereign power that our cases&para;<br>demand.&para;<br>The Court raises concerns about “unnecessary harass­&para;<br>ment of some aliens . . . whom federal officials determine&para;<br>should not be removed.” Ante, at 17. But we have no&para;<br>license to assume, without any support in the record, that&para;<br>Arizona officials would use their arrest authority under §6&para;<br>to harass anyone. And it makes no difference that federal&para;<br>officials might “determine [that some unlawfully present&para;<br>aliens] should not be removed,” ibid. They may well de­&para;<br>termine not to remove from the United States aliens who&para;<br>have no right to be here; but unless and until these aliens&para;<br>have been given the right to remain, Arizona is entitled to&para;<br>arrest them and at least bring them to federal officials’&para;<br>attention, which is all that §6 necessarily entails. (In my&para;<br>view, the State can go further than this, and punish them&para;<br>for their unlawful entry and presence in Arizona.)&para;<br>The Government complains that state officials might not&para;<br>heed “federal priorities.” Indeed they might not, particu­&para;<br>larly if those priorities include willful blindness or deliberate inattention to the presence of removable aliens in&para;<br>Arizona. The State’s whole complaint—the reason this&para;<br>law was passed and this case has arisen—is that the&para;<br>citizens of Arizona believe federal priorities are too lax.&para;<br>The State has the sovereign power to protect its borders&para;<br>more rigorously if it wishes, absent any valid federal&para;<br>prohibition. The Executive’s policy choice of lax federal&para;<br>enforcement does not constitute such a prohibition.&para;<br>§3&para;<br>“In addition to any violation of federal law, a person is&para;<br>guilty of willful failure to complete or carry an alien&para;<br>registration document if the person is in violation of 8&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>[U. S. C.] §1304(e) or §1306(a).” S. B. 1070, §3(A), as&para;<br>amended, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–1509(A).&para;<br>It is beyond question that a State may make violation of&para;<br>federal law a violation of state law as well. We have held&para;<br>that to be so even when the interest protected is a distinc­&para;<br>tively federal interest, such as protection of the dignity of&para;<br>the national flag, see Halter v. Nebraska, 205 U. S. 34&para;<br>(1907), or protection of the Federal Government’s ability&para;<br>to recruit soldiers, Gilbert v. Minnesota, 254 U. S. 325&para;<br>(1920). “[T]he State is not inhibited from making the national&para;<br>purposes its own purposes to the extent of exerting its&para;<br>police power to prevent its own citizens from obstructing&para;<br>the accomplishment of such purposes.” Id., at 331 (inter­&para;<br>nal quotation marks omitted). Much more is that so when,&para;<br>as here, the State is protecting its own interest, the integ­&para;<br>rity of its borders. And we have said that explicitly with&para;<br>regard to illegal immigration: “Despite the exclusive fed­&para;<br>eral control of this Nation’s borders, we cannot conclude&para;<br>that the States are without any power to deter the influx&para;<br>of persons entering the United States against federal law,&para;<br>and whose numbers might have a discernible impact on&para;<br>traditional state concerns.” Plyler v. Doe, 457 U. S. 202,&para;<br>228, n. 23 (1982).&para;<br>The Court’s opinion relies upon Hines v. Davidowitz,&para;<br>supra. Ante, at 9–10. But that case did not, as the Court&para;<br>believes, establish a “field preemption” that implicitly&para;<br>eliminates the States’ sovereign power to exclude those&para;<br>whom federal law excludes. It held that the States are not&para;<br>permitted to establish “additional or auxiliary” registra­&para;<br>tion requirements for aliens. 312 U. S., at 66–67. But §3&para;<br>does not establish additional or auxiliary registration&para;<br>requirements. It merely makes a violation of state law the&para;<br>very same failure to register and failure to carry evidence&para;<br>of registration that are violations of federal law. Hines&para;<br>does not prevent the State from relying on the federal&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>registration system as “an available aid in the enforce­&para;<br>ment of a number of statutes of the state applicable to&para;<br>aliens whose constitutional validity has not been ques­&para;<br>tioned.” Id., at 75–76 (Stone, J., dissenting). One such&para;<br>statute is Arizona’s law forbidding illegal aliens to collect&para;<br>unemployment benefits, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §23–781(B)&para;<br>(West 2012). To enforce that and other laws that validly&para;<br>turn on alien status, Arizona has, in Justice Stone’s words,&para;<br>an interest in knowing “the number and whereabouts of&para;<br>aliens within the state” and in having “a means of their&para;<br>identification,” 312 U. S., at 75. And it can punish the&para;<br>aliens’ failure to comply with the provisions of federal law&para;<br>that make that knowledge and identification possible.&para;<br>In some areas of uniquely federal concern—e.g., fraud in&para;<br>a federal administrative process (Buckman Co. v. Plain­&para;<br>tiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341 (2001)) or perjury in&para;<br>violation of a federally required oath (In re Loney, 134&para;<br>U. S. 372 (1890))—this Court has held that a State has no&para;<br>legitimate interest in enforcing a federal scheme. But the&para;<br>federal alien registration system is certainly not of uniquely&para;<br>federal interest. States, private entities, and individuals&para;<br>rely on the federal registration system (including the&para;<br>E-Verify program) on a regular basis. Arizona’s legitimate in­&para;<br>terest in protecting (among other things) its unemployment­&para;<br>benefits system is an entirely adequate basis for making&para;<br>the violation of federal registration and carry require­&para;<br>ments a violation of state law as well.&para;<br>The Court points out, however, ante, at 11, that in some&para;<br>respects the state law exceeds the punishments prescribed&para;<br>by federal law: It rules out probation and pardon, which&para;<br>are available under federal law. The answer is that it&para;<br>makes no difference. Illegal immigrants who violate §3&para;<br>violate Arizona law. It is one thing to say that the Su­&para;<br>premacy Clause prevents Arizona law from excluding&para;<br>those whom federal law admits. It is quite something else&para;<br>to say that a violation of Arizona law cannot be punished&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>more severely than a violation of federal law. Especially&para;<br>where (as here) the State is defending its own sovereign&para;<br>interests, there is no precedent for such a limitation. The&para;<br>sale of illegal drugs, for example, ordinarily violates state&para;<br>law as well as federal law, and no one thinks that the&para;<br>state penalties cannot exceed the federal. As I have dis­&para;<br>cussed, moreover, “field preemption” cannot establish a&para;<br>prohibition of additional state penalties in the area of&para;<br>immigration.&para;<br>Finally, the Government also suggests that §3 poses an&para;<br>obstacle to the administration of federal immigration law,&para;<br>see Brief for United States 31–33, but “there is no conflict&para;<br>in terms, and no possibility of such conflict, [if] the state&para;<br>statute makes federal law its own,” California v. Zook, 336&para;<br>U. S. 725, 735 (1949).&para;<br>It holds no fear for me, as it does for the Court, that&para;<br>“[w]ere §3 to come into force, the State would have the&para;<br>power to bring criminal charges against individuals for&para;<br>violating a federal law even in circumstances where federal officials in charge of the comprehensive scheme de­&para;<br>termine that prosecution would frustrate federal policies.”&para;<br>Ante, at 11. That seems to me entirely appropriate when&para;<br>the State uses the federal law (as it must) as the criterion&para;<br>for the exercise of its own power, and the implementation&para;<br>of its own policies of excluding those who do not belong&para;<br>there. What I do fear—and what Arizona and the States&para;<br>that support it fear—is that “federal policies” of nonen­&para;<br>forcement will leave the States helpless before those evil&para;<br>effects of illegal immigration that the Court’s opinion&para;<br>dutifully recites in its prologue (ante, at 6) but leaves&para;<br>unremedied in its disposition.&para;<br>§5(C)&para;<br>“It is unlawful for a person who is unlawfully present&para;<br>in the United States and who is an unauthorized alien&para;<br>to knowingly apply for work, solicit work in a public&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

This Court concluded that&para;<br>the California law was not pre-empted, as Congress had&para;<br>neither occupied the field of “regulation of employment of&para;<br>illegal aliens” nor expressed “the clear and manifest pur­&para;<br>pose” of displacing such state regulation. Id., at 356–357&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, at the time&para;<br>De Canas was decided, §5(C) would have been indubitably&para;<br>lawful.&para;<br>The only relevant change is that Congress has since&para;<br>enacted its own restrictions on employers who hire illegal&para;<br>aliens, 8 U. S. C. §1324a, in legislation that also includes&para;<br>some civil (but no criminal) penalties on illegal aliens who&para;<br>accept unlawful employment. The Court concludes from&para;<br>this (reasonably enough) “that Congress made a deliberate&para;<br>choice not to impose criminal penalties on aliens who seek,&para;<br>or engage in, unauthorized employment,” ante, at 13. But&para;<br>that is not the same as a deliberate choice to prohibit&para;<br>the States from imposing criminal penalties. Congress’s&para;<br>intent with regard to exclusion of state law need not be&para;<br>guessed at, but is found in the law’s express pre-emption&para;<br>provision, which excludes “any State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licens­&para;<br>ing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit&para;<br>or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens,”&para;<br>§1324a(h)(2) (emphasis added). Common sense, reflected&para;<br>in the canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius, suggests&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>that the specification of pre-emption for laws punishing&para;<br>“those who employ” implies the lack of pre-emption for&para;<br>other laws, including laws punishing “those who seek or&para;<br>accept employment.”&para;<br>The Court has no credible response to this. It quotes&para;<br>our jurisprudence to the effect that an “express pre­&para;<br>emption provisio[n] does not bar the ordinary working of&para;<br>conflict pre-emption principles.” Ante, at 14 (quoting Geier&para;<br>v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861, 869&para;<br>(2000) (internal quotation marks omitted)). True enough—&para;<br>conflict preemption principles. It then goes on say that&para;<br>since “Congress decided it would be inappropriate to im­&para;<br>pose criminal penalties on aliens who seek or engage in&para;<br>unauthorized employment,” “[i]t follows that a state law to&para;<br>the contrary is an obstacle to the regulatory system Con­&para;<br>gress chose.” Ante, at 15. For “ ‘[w]here a comprehensive&para;<br>federal scheme intentionally leaves a portion of the regu­&para;<br>lated field without controls, then the pre-emptive inference&para;<br>can be drawn.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Puerto Rico Dept. of Con­&para;<br>sumer Affairs v. ISLA Petroleum Corp., 485 U.S. 495, 503&para;<br>(1988)). All that is a classic description not of conflict&para;<br>pre-emption but of field pre-emption, which (concededly)&para;<br>does not occur beyond the terms of an express pre-emption&para;<br>provision.&para;<br>The Court concludes that §5(C) “would interfere with&para;<br>the careful balance struck by Congress,” ante, at 15, (an­&para;<br>other field pre-emption notion, by the way) but that is easy&para;<br>to say and impossible to demonstrate. The Court relies&para;<br>primarily on the fact that “[p]roposals to make unauthor­&para;<br>ized work a criminal offense were debated and discussed&para;<br>during the long process of drafting [the Immigration Re­&para;<br>form and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA)],” “[b]ut Congress&para;<br>rejected them.” Ante, at 14. There is no more reason to&para;<br>believe that this rejection was expressive of a desire that&para;<br>there be no sanctions on employees, than expressive of a&para;<br>desire that such sanctions be left to the States.

Of course there is no reason why the&para;<br>Federal Executive’s need to allocate its scarce enforcement&para;<br>resources should disable Arizona from devoting its re­&para;<br>sources to illegal immigration in Arizona that in its view&para;<br>the Federal Executive has given short shrift. Despite&para;<br>Congress’s prescription that “the immigration laws of the&para;<br>United States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly,”&para;<br>IRCA §115, 100 Stat. 3384, Arizona asserts without&para;<br>contradiction and with supporting citations:&para;<br>“[I]n the last decade federal enforcement efforts have&para;<br>focused primarily on areas in California and Texas,&para;<br>leaving Arizona’s border to suffer from comparative&para;<br>neglect.

The President said at a&para;<br>news conference that the new program is “the right thing&para;<br>to do” in light of Congress’s failure to pass the Administra­&para;<br>tion’s proposed revision of the Immigration Act.7 Perhaps&para;<br>it is, though Arizona may not think so.

B. 1070. I reach that conclusion, however, for the simple reason that there is no conflict between the “ordinary&para;<br>meanin[g]” of the relevant federal laws and that of the&para;<br>four provisions of Arizona law at issue here. Wyeth v.&para;<br>Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 588 (2009) (THOMAS, J., concurring&para;<br>in judgment) (“Pre-emption analysis should not be a freewheeling judicial inquiry into whether a state statute is in&para;<br>tension with federal objectives, but an inquiry into whether&para;<br>the ordinary meanings of state and federal law conflict”&para;<br>(brackets; internal quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>Section 2(B) of S. B. 1070 provides that, when Arizona&para;<br>law enforcement officers reasonably suspect that a person&para;<br>they have lawfully stopped, detained, or arrested is unlawfully present, “a reasonable attempt shall be made, when&para;<br>practicable, to determine the immigration status of the&para;<br>person” pursuant to the verification procedure established&para;<br>by Congress in 8 U. S. C. §1373(c). Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.&para;<br>§11–1051(B) (West 2012). Nothing in the text of that or&para;<br>any other federal statute prohibits Arizona from directing&para;<br>its officers to make immigration-related inquiries in these&para;<br>situations. To the contrary, federal law expressly states&para;<br>that “no State or local government entity may be prohib-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of THOMAS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>ited, or in any way restricted, from sending to or receiving&para;<br>from” federal officials “information regarding the immigration status” of an alien. 8 U. S. C. §1644. And, federal&para;<br>law imposes an affirmative obligation on federal officials&para;<br>to respond to a State’s immigration-related inquiries.&para;<br>§1373(c).&para;<br>Section 6 of S. B. 1070 authorizes Arizona law enforcement officers to make warrantless arrests when there is&para;<br>probable cause to believe that an arrestee has committed a&para;<br>public offense that renders him removable under federal&para;<br>immigration law. States, as sovereigns, have inherent&para;<br>authority to conduct arrests for violations of federal law,&para;<br>unless and until Congress removes that authority. See&para;<br>United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, 589 (1948) (holding&para;<br>that state law determines the validity of a warrantless&para;<br>arrest for a violation of federal law “in the absence of&para;<br>an applicable federal statute”). Here, no federal statute&para;<br>purports to withdraw that authority. As JUSTICE SCALIA&para;<br>notes, ante, at 12 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), federal law does limit the authority of federal&para;<br>officials to arrest removable aliens, but those statutes do&para;<br>not apply to state officers. And, federal law expressly&para;<br>recognizes that state officers may “cooperate with the&para;<br>Attorney General” in the “apprehension” and “detention”&para;<br>of “aliens not lawfully present in the United States.”&para;<br>§1357(g)(10)(B). Nothing in that statute indicates that&para;<br>such cooperation requires a prior “request, approval, or&para;<br>other instruction from the Federal Government.” Ante, at&para;<br>18 (majority opinion).&para;<br>Section 3 of S. B. 1070 makes it a crime under Arizona&para;<br>law for an unlawfully present alien to willfully fail to&para;<br>complete or carry an alien registration document in violation of 8 U. S. C. §1304(e) and §1306(a). Section 3 simply&para;<br>incorporates federal registration standards. Unlike the&para;<br>Court, I would not hold that Congress pre-empted the field&para;<br>of enforcing those standards. “[O]ur recent cases have&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

Here, nothing in the text of the relevant federal&para;<br>statutes indicates that Congress intended enforcement of&para;<br>its registration requirements to be exclusively the province of the Federal Government. That Congress created a&para;<br>“full set of standards governing alien registration,” ante, at&para;<br>10 (majority opinion), merely indicates that it intended the&para;<br>scheme to be capable of working on its own, not that it&para;<br>wanted to preclude the States from enforcing the federal&para;<br>standards. Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52 (1941), is not&para;<br>to the contrary. As JUSTICE SCALIA explains, ante, at 14,&para;<br>Hines at most holds that federal law pre-empts the States&para;<br>from creating additional registration requirements. But&para;<br>here, Arizona is merely seeking to enforce the very registration requirements that Congress created.&para;<br>Section 5(C) of S. B. 1070 prohibits unlawfully present&para;<br>aliens from knowingly applying for, soliciting, or performing work in Arizona. Section 5(C) operates only on individuals whom Congress has already declared ineligible to&para;<br>work in the United States. Nothing in the text of the&para;<br>federal immigration laws prohibits States from imposing&para;<br>their own criminal penalties on such individuals. Federal law expressly pre-empts States from “imposing civil or&para;<br>criminal sanctions (other than through licensing and&para;<br>similar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit or refer&para;<br>for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens.” 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1324a(h)(2) (emphasis added). But it leaves States free&para;<br>to impose criminal sanctions on the employees themselves.&para;<br>Despite the lack of any conflict between the ordinary&para;<br>meaning of the Arizona law and that of the federal laws at&para;<br>issue here, the Court holds that various provisions of the&para;<br>Arizona law are pre-empted because they “stan[d] as an&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of THOMAS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full&para;<br>purposes and objectives of Congress.” Hines, supra, at 67.&para;<br>I have explained that the “purposes and objectives” theory&para;<br>of implied pre-emption is inconsistent with the Constitution because it invites courts to engage in freewheeling&para;<br>speculation about congressional purpose that roams well&para;<br>beyond statutory text. See Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 604 (opinion concurring in judgment); see also Williamson v. Mazda&para;<br>Motor of America, Inc., 562 U.

Thus, even assuming the existence of some tension between Arizona’s law&para;<br>and the supposed “purposes and objectives” of Congress, I&para;<br>would not hold that any of the provisions of the Arizona&para;<br>law at issue here are pre-empted on that basis.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

B.&para;<br>1070. Section 2(B) requires Arizona law enforcement&para;<br>officers to make a “reasonable attempt,” “when practicable,” to ascertain the immigration status of any person&para;<br>whom an officer lawfully stops, detains, or arrests “where&para;<br>reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and&para;<br>is unlawfully present in the United States.” Ariz. Rev.&para;<br>Stat. Ann. §11–1051(B) (West 2012). Section 3 provides&para;<br>that an alien who willfully fails “to complete or carry an&para;<br>alien registration document” in violation of 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1304(e) or §1306(a) is guilty of a misdemeanor. Ariz. Rev.&para;<br>Stat. Ann. §13–1509(A) (West Supp. 2011). Section 5(C)&para;<br>makes it a misdemeanor for an unauthorized alien who&para;<br>is unlawfully present in the United States “to knowingly&para;<br>apply for work, solicit work in a public place or perform&para;<br>work as an employee or independent contractor.” Ariz.&para;<br>Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–2928(C). And §6 authorizes Arizona&para;<br>law enforcement officers to arrest without a warrant any&para;<br>person who an officer has probable cause to believe “has&para;<br>committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.&para;<br>§13–3883(A)(5).&para;<br>I agree with the Court that §2(B) is not pre-empted.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v.

The United&para;<br>States’ argument that §2(B) is pre-empted, not by any&para;<br>federal statute or regulation, but simply by the Executive’s&para;<br>current enforcement policy is an astounding assertion of&para;<br>federal executive power that the Court rightly rejects.&para;<br>I also agree with the Court that §3 is pre-empted by&para;<br>virtue of our decision in Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S.&para;<br>52 (1941). Our conclusion in that case that Congress had&para;<br>enacted an “all-embracing system” of alien registration&para;<br>and that States cannot “enforce additional or auxiliary&para;<br>regulations,” id., at 66–67, 74, forecloses Arizona’s attempt&para;<br>here to impose additional, state-law penalties for violations of the federal registration scheme.&para;<br>While I agree with the Court on §2(B) and §3, I part&para;<br>ways on §5(C) and §6. The Court’s holding on §5(C) is&para;<br>inconsistent with De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S. 351 (1976),&para;<br>which held that employment regulation, even of aliens&para;<br>unlawfully present in the country, is an area of traditional&para;<br>state concern. Because state police powers are implicated&para;<br>here, our precedents require us to presume that federal&para;<br>law does not displace state law unless Congress’ intent to&para;<br>do so is clear and manifest. I do not believe Congress has&para;<br>spoken with the requisite clarity to justify invalidation of&para;<br>§5(C). Nor do I believe that §6 is invalid. Like §2(B), §6&para;<br>adds virtually nothing to the authority that Arizona law&para;<br>enforcement officers already exercise. And whatever little&para;<br>authority they have gained is consistent with federal law.&para;<br>Section 2(B)&para;<br>A&para;<br>Although §2(B) of the Arizona law has occasioned much&para;<br>controversy, it adds nothing to the authority that Arizona&para;<br>law enforcement officers, like officers in all other States,&para;<br>already possess under federal law.

It is triggered&para;<br>only when a “lawful stop, detention or arrest [is] made . . .&para;<br>in the enforcement of any other [state or local] law or&para;<br>ordinance.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051(B) (emphasis&para;<br>added). Section 2(B) thus comes into play only when&para;<br>an officer has reasonable suspicion or probable cause to&para;<br>believe that a person has committed a nonimmigration&para;<br>offense. Arizona officers plainly possessed this authority&para;<br>before §2(B) took effect.&para;<br>Section 2(B) also does not expand the authority of Arizona officers to inquire about the immigration status of&para;<br>persons who are lawfully detained. When a person is&para;<br>stopped or arrested and “reasonable suspicion exists that&para;<br>the person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the&para;<br>United States,” §2(B) instructs Arizona officers to make a&para;<br>“reasonable attempt,” “when practicable,” to ascertain that&para;<br>person’s immigration status. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–&para;<br>1051(B). Even before the Arizona Legislature enacted&para;<br>§2(B), federal law permitted state and local officers to&para;<br>make such inquiries. In 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)(10)(A), Congress has made clear that state and local governments&para;<br>need not enter into formal agreements with the Federal&para;<br>Government in order “to communicate with the [Federal&para;<br>Government] regarding the immigration status of any&para;<br>individual.” In addition, Congress has mandated that&para;<br>neither the Federal Government nor any state or local&para;<br>government may “prohibit, or in any way restrict, any&para;<br>government entity or official from sending to, or receiving&para;<br>from, [the Federal Government] information regarding the&para;<br>citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of&para;<br>any individual.” §1373(a); see also §1644 (providing that&para;<br>“no State or local government entity may be prohibited,&para;<br>or in any way restricted, from sending to or receiving&para;<br>from [the Federal Government] information regarding the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v.

And while these provisions preserve the&para;<br>authority of state and local officers to seek immigrationstatus information from the Federal Government, another&para;<br>federal statute, §1373(c), requires that the Federal Government respond to any such inquiries “by providing the&para;<br>requested verification or status information.” It comes&para;<br>as no surprise, therefore, that many States and localities&para;<br>permit their law enforcement officers to make the kinds of&para;<br>inquiries that §2(B) prescribes. See App. 294–298 (reporting that officers in 59 surveyed state and local jurisdictions “generally” ask arrestees about their immigration&para;<br>status while 34 do not and that officers in 78 jurisdictions&para;<br>“generally” inform Immigration and Customs Enforcement&para;<br>(ICE) when they believe an arrestee to be an undocumented&para;<br>alien while only 17 do not). Congress has invited state&para;<br>and local governments to make immigration-related inquiries and has even obligated the Federal Government to&para;<br>respond. Through §2(B), Arizona has taken Congress up&para;<br>on that invitation.&para;<br>The United States does not deny that officers may, at&para;<br>their own discretion, inquire about the immigration status&para;<br>of persons whom they lawfully detain. Instead, the United&para;<br>States argues that §2(B) is pre-empted because it impedes&para;<br>federal-state cooperation by mandating that officers verify&para;<br>the immigration status of every detained person if there is&para;<br>reason to believe that the person is unlawfully present in&para;<br>the country. The United States claims that §2(B)’s mandate runs contrary to federal law in that it “precludes&para;<br>officers from taking [the Federal Government’s] priorities&para;<br>and discretion into account.” Brief for United States&para;<br>50. “[B]y interposing a mandatory state law between state&para;<br>and local officers and their federal counterparts,” writes&para;<br>the United States, §2(B) “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the federal requirement of cooperation&para;<br>and the full effectuation of the enforcement judgment and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>discretion Congress has vested in the Executive Branch.”&para;<br>Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).&para;<br>The underlying premise of the United States’ argument&para;<br>seems to be that state and local officers, when left to their&para;<br>own devices, generally take federal enforcement priorities&para;<br>into account. But there is no reason to think that this&para;<br>premise is true. And even if it were, it would not follow&para;<br>that §2(B)’s blanket mandate is at odds with federal law.&para;<br>Nothing in the relevant federal statutes requires state and&para;<br>local officers to consider the Federal Government’s priorities before requesting verification of a person’s immigration status. Neither 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)(10) nor §1373(a)&para;<br>conditions the right of state and local officers to communicate with the Federal Government on their first taking&para;<br>account of its priorities. Nor does §1373(c) condition the&para;<br>Federal Government’s obligation to answer requests for information on the sensitivity of state and local officers to&para;<br>its enforcement discretion. In fact, §1373(c) dictates that&para;<br>the Federal Government “shall respond” to any inquiry&para;<br>seeking verification of immigration status, and that command applies whether or not the requesting officer has&para;<br>bothered to consider federal priorities. Because no federal&para;<br>statute requires such consideration, §2(B) does not conflict&para;<br>with federal law.&para;<br>In any event, it is hard to see how state and local officers could proceed in conformity with the Federal Government’s enforcement priorities without making an inquiry&para;<br>into a suspected alien’s immigration status. For example,&para;<br>one of the Federal Government’s highest priorities is the&para;<br>apprehension and removal of aliens who have failed to&para;<br>comply with a final order of removal. See App. 108. How&para;<br>can an officer identify those persons without first inquiring about their status? At bottom, the discretion&para;<br>that ultimately matters is not whether to verify a person’s&para;<br>immigration status but whether to act once the person’s&para;<br>status is known. For that reason, §2(B)’s verification&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>requirement is not contrary to federal law because the&para;<br>Federal Government retains the discretion that matters&para;<br>most––that is, the discretion to enforce the law in particular cases. If an Arizona officer contacts the Federal&para;<br>Government to verify a person’s immigration status and&para;<br>federal records reveal that the person is in the country unlawfully, the Federal Government decides, presumably based on its enforcement priorities, whether to have&para;<br>the person released or transferred to federal custody.&para;<br>Enforcement discretion thus lies with the Federal Government, not with Arizona. Nothing in §2(B) suggests&para;<br>otherwise.&para;<br>The United States’ attack on §2(B) is quite remarkable.&para;<br>The United States suggests that a state law may be preempted, not because it conflicts with a federal statute or&para;<br>regulation, but because it is inconsistent with a federal&para;<br>agency’s current enforcement priorities. Those priorities,&para;<br>however, are not law. They are nothing more than agency&para;<br>policy. I am aware of no decision of this Court recognizing&para;<br>that mere policy can have pre-emptive force. Cf. Barclays&para;<br>Bank PLC v. Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal., 512 U. S. 298, 330&para;<br>(1994) (holding that “Executive Branch communications&para;<br>that express federal policy but lack the force of law cannot&para;<br>render unconstitutional” an “otherwise valid, congressionally condoned” state law). If §2(B) were pre-empted at&para;<br>the present time because it is out of sync with the Federal&para;<br>Government’s current priorities, would it be unpre-empted&para;<br>at some time in the future if the agency’s priorities&para;<br>changed?&para;<br>Like most law enforcement agencies, ICE does not set&para;<br>out inflexible rules for its officers to follow. To the contrary, it provides a list of factors to guide its officers’&para;<br>enforcement discretion on a case-by-case basis. See Memorandum from John Morton, Director, ICE, to All Field&para;<br>Office Directors et al., p. 4 (June 17, 2011) (“This list is not&para;<br>exhaustive and no one factor is determinative.

The decisions&para;<br>should be based on the totality of the circumstances, with&para;<br>the goal of conforming to ICE’s enforcement priorities”).&para;<br>Among those factors is “the agency’s civil immigration&para;<br>enforcement priorities,” ibid., which change from administration to administration. If accepted, the United States’&para;<br>pre-emption argument would give the Executive unprecedented power to invalidate state laws that do not meet&para;<br>with its approval, even if the state laws are otherwise&para;<br>consistent with federal statutes and duly promulgated&para;<br>regulations. This argument, to say the least, is fundamentally at odds with our federal system.&para;<br>B&para;<br>It has been suggested that §2(B) will cause some persons who are lawfully stopped to be detained in violation&para;<br>of their constitutional rights while a prolonged investigation of their immigration status is undertaken. But nothing on the face of the law suggests that it will be enforced&para;<br>in a way that violates the Fourth Amendment or any other&para;<br>provision of the Constitution. The law instructs officers to&para;<br>make a “reasonable attempt” to investigate immigration&para;<br>status, and this language is best understood as incorporating the Fourth Amendment’s standard of reasonableness.&para;<br>Indeed, the Arizona Legislature has directed that §2(B)&para;<br>“shall be implemented in a manner consistent with federal&para;<br>laws . . . protecting the civil rights of all persons and respecting the privileges and immunities of United States&para;<br>citizens.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §11–1051(L).&para;<br>In the situations that seem most likely to occur, enforcement of §2(B) will present familiar Fourth Amendment questions. To take a common situation, suppose that&para;<br>a car is stopped for speeding, a nonimmigration offense.&para;<br>(Recall that §2(B) comes into play only where a stop or&para;<br>arrest is made for a nonimmigration offense.) Suppose&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>also that the officer who makes the stop subsequently&para;<br>acquires reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver&para;<br>entered the country illegally, which is a federal crime. See&para;<br>8 U. S. C. §1325(a).&para;<br>It is well established that state and local officers generally have authority to make stops and arrests for violations of federal criminal laws. See, e.g., Miller v. United&para;<br>States, 357 U. S. 301, 305 (1958); United States v. Di Re,&para;<br>332 U. S. 581, 589 (1948). I see no reason why this principle should not apply to immigration crimes as well. Lower&para;<br>courts have so held. See, e.g., Estrada v. Rhode Island,&para;<br>594 F. 3d 56, 65 (CA1 2010) (upholding the lawfulness of&para;<br>a detention because the officer had an objectively reasonable belief that the arrestees “had committed immigration violations”); United States v. Vasquez-Alvarez, 176&para;<br>F. 3d 1294, 1296 (CA10 1999) (noting that “state lawenforcement officers have the general authority to investigate and make arrests for violations of federal immigration laws”); Gonzales v. Peoria, 722 F. 2d 468, 475 (CA9&para;<br>1983), overruled on other grounds, Hodgers-Durgin v. de&para;<br>la Vina, 199 F. 3d 1037 (1999) (en banc) (holding that&para;<br>“federal law does not preclude local enforcement of the&para;<br>criminal provisions” of federal immigration law). And the&para;<br>United States, consistent with the position long taken by&para;<br>the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the Department of&para;<br>Justice, does not contend otherwise. See Brief for United&para;<br>States 55, n. 33; see also Memorandum from OLC to the&para;<br>Attorney General (Apr. 3, 2002), App. 268–273; Assistance&para;<br>by State and Local Police in Apprehending Illegal Aliens,&para;<br>20 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 26 (1996).&para;<br>More importantly, no federal statute casts doubt on this&para;<br>authority. To be sure, there are a handful of statutes that&para;<br>purport to authorize state and local officers to make immigration-related arrests in certain situations. See, e.g., 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §1103(a)(10) (providing for the extension of “any”&para;<br>immigration enforcement authority to state and local&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>officers in the event of an “actual or imminent mass influx of aliens arriving off the coast”); §1252c(a) (providing authority to arrest criminal aliens who had illegally&para;<br>reentered the country but only after consultation with&para;<br>the Federal Government); §1324(c) (providing authority&para;<br>to make arrests for transporting and harboring certain&para;<br>aliens). But a grant of federal arrest authority in some&para;<br>cases does not manifest a clear congressional intent to&para;<br>displace the States’ police powers in all other cases. Without more, such an inference is too weak to overcome our&para;<br>presumption against pre-emption where traditional state&para;<br>police powers are at stake. Accordingly, in our hypothetical case, the Arizona officer may arrest the driver for&para;<br>violating §1325(a) if the officer has probable cause. And if&para;<br>the officer has reasonable suspicion, the officer may detain&para;<br>the driver, to the extent permitted by the Fourth Amendment, while the question of illegal entry is investigated.&para;<br>We have held that a detention based on reasonable&para;<br>suspicion that the detainee committed a particular crime&para;<br>“can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time&para;<br>reasonably required to complete that mission.” Illinois v.&para;<br>Caballes, 543 U. S. 405, 407 (2005). But if during the&para;<br>course of a stop an officer acquires suspicion that a detainee committed a different crime, the detention may be&para;<br>extended for a reasonable time to verify or dispel that&para;<br>suspicion. Cf. Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93, 101 (2005)&para;<br>(holding that “no additional Fourth Amendment justification” was required because any questioning concerning&para;<br>immigration status did not prolong the detention). In our&para;<br>hypothetical case, therefore, if the officer, after initially&para;<br>stopping the car for speeding, has a reasonable suspicion&para;<br>that the driver entered the country illegally, the officer&para;<br>may investigate for evidence of illegal entry. But the&para;<br>length and nature of this investigation must remain within the limits set out in our Fourth Amendment cases. An&para;<br>investigative stop, if prolonged, can become an arrest and&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>thus require probable cause. See Caballes, supra, at 407.&para;<br>Similarly, if a person is moved from the site of the stop,&para;<br>probable cause will likely be required. See Hayes v. Florida,&para;<br>470 U. S. 811, 816 (1985) (holding that the line between detention and arrest is crossed “when the police,&para;<br>without probable cause or a warrant, forcibly remove a&para;<br>person from his home or other place in which he is entitled&para;<br>to be and transport him to the police station, where he is&para;<br>detained, although briefly, for investigative purposes”).&para;<br>If properly implemented, §2(B) should not lead to federal constitutional violations, but there is no denying that&para;<br>enforcement of §2(B) will multiply the occasions on which&para;<br>sensitive Fourth Amendment issues will crop up. These&para;<br>civil-liberty concerns, I take it, are at the heart of most&para;<br>objections to §2(B). Close and difficult questions will inevitably arise as to whether an officer had reasonable&para;<br>suspicion to believe that a person who is stopped for some&para;<br>other reason entered the country illegally, and there is a&para;<br>risk that citizens, lawful permanent residents, and others&para;<br>who are lawfully present in the country will be detained.&para;<br>To mitigate this risk, Arizona could issue guidance to&para;<br>officers detailing the circumstances that typically give&para;<br>rise to reasonable suspicion of unlawful presence. And in&para;<br>the spirit of the federal-state cooperation that the United&para;<br>States champions, the Federal Government could share its&para;<br>own guidelines. Arizona could also provide officers with a&para;<br>nonexclusive list containing forms of identification sufficient under §2(B) to dispel any suspicion of unlawful&para;<br>presence. If Arizona accepts licenses from most States as&para;<br>proof of legal status, the problem of roadside detentions&para;<br>will be greatly mitigated.1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 When the Real ID Act takes effect, the Federal Government will no&para;<br>longer accept state forms of identification that fail to meet certain&para;<br>federal requirements. §202(a)(1), 119 Stat. 312. One requirement is&para;<br>that any identification be issued only on proof that the applicant&para;<br>is lawfully present in the United States. §202(c)(2)(B), id., at 313.

Although&para;<br>there is some ambiguity in Hines, the Court largely spoke&para;<br>in the language of field pre-emption. The Court explained&para;<br>that where Congress “has enacted a complete scheme of&para;<br>regulation and has therein provided a standard for the&para;<br>registration of aliens, states cannot, inconsistently with&para;<br>the purpose of Congress, conflict or interfere with, curtail&para;<br>or complement, the federal law, or enforce additional or&para;<br>auxiliary regulations.” 312 U. S., at 66–67. In finding the&para;<br>Pennsylvania alien-registration law pre-empted, the Court&para;<br>observed that Congress had “provided a standard for&para;<br>alien registration in a single integrated and all-embracing&para;<br>system” and that its intent was “to protect the personal&para;<br>liberties of law-abiding aliens through one uniform national registration system.” Id., at 74. If we credit our&para;<br>holding in Hines that Congress has enacted “a single integrated and all-embracing system” of alien registration&para;<br>and that States cannot “complement” that system or “enforce additional or auxiliary regulations,” id., at 66–67, 74,&para;<br>then Arizona’s attempt to impose additional, state-law&para;<br>penalties for violations of federal registration requirements must be invalidated.&para;<br>Section 5(C)&para;<br>While I agree that §3 is pre-empted, I disagree with the&para;<br>Court’s decision to strike down §5(C). I do so in large&para;<br>measure because the Court fails to give the same solicitude to our decision in De Canas, 424 U. S. 351, as it is&para;<br>willing to give our decision in Hines. In De Canas, the&para;<br>Court upheld against a pre-emption challenge a state law&para;<br>imposing fines on employers that hired aliens who were&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>anticipate that most, if not all, States will eventually issue forms of&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>identification that suffice to establish lawful presence under §2(B). &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>unlawfully present in the United States. The Court explained that the mere fact that “aliens are the subject of a&para;<br>state statute does not render it a regulation of immigration.” 424 U. S., at 355. The Court emphasized instead&para;<br>that “States possess broad authority under their police&para;<br>powers to regulate the employment relationship to protect&para;<br>workers within the State.” Id., at 356. In light of that&para;<br>broad authority, the Court declared that “[o]nly a demonstration that complete ouster of state power . . . was ‘the&para;<br>clear and manifest purpose of Congress’ would justify” the&para;<br>conclusion that “state regulation designed to protect vital&para;<br>state interests must give way to paramount federal legislation.” Id., at 357 (some internal quotation marks omitted); see also Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S.&para;<br>431, 449 (2005) (“In areas of traditional state regulation,&para;<br>[the Court] assume[s] that a federal statute has not supplanted state law unless Congress has made such an&para;<br>intention ‘clear and manifest’ ” (some internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted)).&para;<br>The Court now tells us that times have changed. Since&para;<br>De Canas, Congress has enacted “a comprehensive framework for combating the employment of illegal aliens,” and&para;<br>even though aliens who seek or obtain unauthorized work&para;<br>are not subject to criminal sanctions, they can suffer civil&para;<br>penalties. Ante, at 12–13 (internal quotation marks omitted). Undoubtedly, federal regulation in this area is&para;<br>more pervasive today. But our task remains unchanged:&para;<br>to determine whether the federal scheme discloses a clear&para;<br>and manifest congressional intent to displace state law.&para;<br>The Court gives short shrift to our presumption against&para;<br>pre-emption. Having no express statement of congressional intent to support its analysis, the Court infers from&para;<br>stale legislative history and from the comprehensiveness&para;<br>of the federal scheme that “Congress made a deliberate&para;<br>choice not to impose criminal penalties on aliens who seek,&para;<br>or engage in, unauthorized employment.” Ante, at 13.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

Ante, at 15.&para;<br>The one thing that is clear from the federal scheme is&para;<br>that Congress chose not to impose federal criminal penalties on aliens who seek or obtain unauthorized work. But&para;<br>that does not mean that Congress also chose to pre-empt&para;<br>state criminal penalties. The inference is plausible, but&para;<br>far from necessary. As we have said before, the “decision&para;<br>not to adopt a regulation” is not “the functional equivalent&para;<br>of a regulation prohibiting all States and their political&para;<br>subdivisions from adopting such a regulation.” Sprietsma&para;<br>v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 65 (2002). With any&para;<br>statutory scheme, Congress chooses to do some things and&para;<br>not others. If that alone were enough to demonstrate preemptive intent, there would be little left over for the&para;<br>States to regulate, especially now that federal authority&para;<br>reaches so far and wide. States would occupy tiny islands&para;<br>in a sea of federal power. This explains why state laws&para;<br>implicating traditional state powers are not pre-empted&para;<br>unless there is a “clear and manifest” congressional intention to do so.&para;<br>Not only is there little evidence that Congress intended&para;<br>to pre-empt state laws like §5(C), there is some evidence&para;<br>that Congress intended the opposite result. In making it&para;<br>unlawful for employers to hire unauthorized aliens, see 8&para;<br>U. S. C. §1324a(a), Congress made it clear that “any State&para;<br>or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other&para;<br>than through licensing and similar laws)” upon employers&para;<br>was pre-empted, §1324a(h)(2). Noticeably absent is any&para;<br>similar directive pre-empting state or local laws targeting&para;<br>aliens who seek or obtain unauthorized employment.&para;<br>Given that Congress expressly pre-empted certain state&para;<br>and local laws pertaining to employers but remained silent&para;<br>about laws pertaining to employees, one could infer that&para;<br>Congress intended to preserve state and local authority to&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>regulate the employee side of the equation. At the very&para;<br>least, it raises serious doubts about whether Congress&para;<br>intended to pre-empt such authority.&para;<br>The Court dismisses any inferences that might be&para;<br>drawn from the express pre-emption provision. See ante,&para;<br>at 14. But even though the existence of that provision&para;<br>“does not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption&para;<br>principles” or impose a “ ‘special burden’ ” against preemption, Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S.&para;<br>861, 869–870 (2000), it is still probative of congressional&para;<br>intent. And it is the intent of Congress that is the “ultimate touchstone.” Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375&para;<br>U. S. 96, 103 (1963).&para;<br>The Court infers from Congress’ decision not to impose&para;<br>federal criminal penalties that Congress intended to preempt state criminal penalties. But given that the express&para;<br>pre-emption provision covers only state and local laws&para;<br>regulating employers, one could just as well infer that&para;<br>Congress did not intend to pre-empt state or local laws&para;<br>aimed at alien employees who unlawfully seek or obtain&para;<br>work. Surely Congress’ decision not to extend its express&para;<br>pre-emption provision to state or local laws like §5(C) is&para;<br>more probative of its intent on the subject of pre-emption&para;<br>than its decision not to impose federal criminal penalties&para;<br>for unauthorized work. In any event, the point I wish&para;<br>to emphasize is that inferences can be drawn either way.&para;<br>There are no necessary inferences that point decisively for&para;<br>or against pre-emption. Therefore, if we take seriously&para;<br>that state employment regulation is a traditional state&para;<br>concern and can be pre-empted only on a showing of&para;<br>“clear and manifest” congressional intent as required by De&para;<br>Canas, then §5(C) must survive. “Our precedents establish that a high threshold must be met if a state law is to&para;<br>be pre-empted for conflicting with the purposes of a federal Act.” Chamber of Commerce of United States of America&para;<br>v.

I do&para;<br>not believe the United States has surmounted that barrier&para;<br>here.&para;<br>Section 6&para;<br>I also disagree with the Court’s decision that §6 is preempted. This provision adds little to the authority that&para;<br>Arizona officers already possess, and whatever additional&para;<br>authority it confers is consistent with federal law. Section&para;<br>6 amended an Arizona statute that authorizes warrantless&para;<br>arrests. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. §13–3883 (West 2010). Before §6 was added, that statute already permitted arrests&para;<br>without a warrant for felonies, misdemeanors committed&para;<br>in the arresting officer’s presence, petty offenses, and&para;<br>certain traffic-related criminal violations.&para;<br>See §§13–&para;<br>3883(A)(1)–(4). Largely duplicating the authority already&para;<br>conferred by these prior subsections, §6 added a new&para;<br>subsection, §13–3883(A)(5) (West Supp. 2011), that authorizes officers to make warrantless arrests on probable&para;<br>cause that the arrestee has committed a “public offense”&para;<br>for which the arrestee is removable from the United&para;<br>States. A “public offense” is defined as conduct that is&para;<br>punishable by imprisonment or a fine according to the law&para;<br>of the State where the conduct occurred and that would be&para;<br>punishable under Arizona law had the conduct occurred in&para;<br>Arizona. See §13–105(27).&para;<br>In what way, if any, does §6 enlarge the arrest authority&para;<br>of Arizona officers? It has been suggested that §6 confers&para;<br>new authority in the following three circumstances: (1)&para;<br>where the arrestee committed but has not been charged&para;<br>with committing an offense in another State; (2) where the&para;<br>officer has probable cause to believe the arrestee committed an offense for which he was previously arrested but&para;<br>not prosecuted; and (3) where the arrestee committed but&para;<br>has already served the sentence for a removable offense.&para;<br>641 F. 3d 359, 361 (CA9 2011). These are exceedingly&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v.

But such cases are possible, and therefore we must&para;<br>decide whether there are circumstances under which federal law precludes a state officer from making an arrest&para;<br>based on probable cause that the arrestee committed a&para;<br>removable offense.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The idea that state and local officers may carry out&para;<br>arrests in the service of federal law is not unprecedented.&para;<br>As previously noted, our cases establish that state and&para;<br>local officers may make warrantless arrests for violations&para;<br>of federal law and that “in the absence of an applicable&para;<br>federal statute the law of the state where an arrest without warrant takes place determines its validity.” Di Re,&para;<br>332 U. S., at 589; see also Miller, 357 U. S., at 305 (stating&para;<br>that, where a state officer makes an arrest based on federal law, “the lawfulness of the arrest without warrant&para;<br>is to be determined by reference to state law”). Therefore,&para;<br>given the premise, which I understand both the United&para;<br>States and the Court to accept, that state and local officers&para;<br>do have inherent authority to make arrests in aid of federal law, we must ask whether Congress has done anything&para;<br>to curtail or pre-empt that authority in this particular&para;<br>case.&para;<br>Neither the United States nor the Court goes so far as to&para;<br>say that state and local officers have no power to arrest&para;<br>criminal aliens based on their removability. To do so&para;<br>would fly in the face of 8 U. S. C. §1357(g)(10). Under&para;<br>§§1357(g)(1)–(9), the Federal Government may enter into&para;<br>formal agreements with States and municipalities under&para;<br>which their officers may perform certain duties of a federal immigration officer. But §1357(g)(10)(B) makes clear&para;<br>that States and municipalities need not enter into those&para;<br>agreements “otherwise to cooperate . . . in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>lawfully present in the United States.” It goes without&para;<br>saying that state and local officers could not provide&para;<br>meaningful cooperation in the apprehension, detention,&para;<br>and ultimate removal of criminal aliens without some&para;<br>power to make arrests.&para;<br>Although §1357(g)(10) contemplates state and local&para;<br>authority to apprehend criminal aliens for the purpose of&para;<br>removal, the Court rejects out of hand any possibility that&para;<br>officers could exercise that authority without federal&para;<br>direction. Despite acknowledging that there is “ambiguity&para;<br>as to what constitutes cooperation,” the Court says that&para;<br>“no coherent understanding of the term would incorporate&para;<br>the unilateral decision of state officers to arrest an alien&para;<br>for being removable absent any request, approval, or other&para;<br>instruction from the Federal Government.” Ante, at 18.&para;<br>The Court adopts an unnecessarily stunted view of cooperation. No one would say that a state or local officer&para;<br>has failed to cooperate by making an on-the-spot arrest to&para;<br>enforce federal law. Unsolicited aid is not necessarily&para;<br>uncooperative.&para;<br>To be sure, were an officer to persist in making an arrest that the officer knows is unwanted, such conduct&para;<br>would not count as cooperation. But nothing in the relevant federal statutes suggests that Congress does not&para;<br>want aliens who have committed removable offenses to be&para;<br>arrested.2 To the contrary, §1226(c)(1) commands that the&para;<br>Executive “shall take into custody any alien” who is deportable for having committed a specified offense. And&para;<br>§1226(c)(2) substantially limits the circumstances under&para;<br>which the Executive has discretion to release aliens held&para;<br>in custody under paragraph (1). So if an officer arrests an&para;<br>alien who is removable for having committed one of the&para;<br>crimes listed in §1226(c)(1), the Federal Government is&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 That goes for the Executive Branch as well, which has made the&para;<br>apprehension and removal of criminal aliens a priority. See App. 108.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>obligated to take the alien into custody.&para;<br>That Congress generally requires the Executive to take&para;<br>custody of criminal aliens casts considerable doubt on the&para;<br>Court’s concern that §6 is an obstacle to the Federal Government’s exercise of discretion. The Court claims that&para;<br>the authority conferred by §6 “could be exercised without&para;<br>any input from the Federal Government about whether&para;<br>an arrest is warranted in a particular case” and that this&para;<br>“would allow the State to achieve its own immigration&para;<br>policy,” resulting in the “unnecessary harassment of some&para;<br>aliens . . . whom federal officials determine should not be&para;<br>removed.” Ante, at 17. But §1226(c)(1) belies the Court’s&para;<br>fear. In many, if not most, cases involving aliens who are&para;<br>removable for having committed criminal offenses, Congress has left the Executive no discretion but to take the&para;<br>alien into custody. State and local officers do not frustrate the removal process by arresting criminal aliens.&para;<br>The Executive retains complete discretion over whether&para;<br>those aliens are ultimately removed. And once the Federal Government makes a determination that a particular&para;<br>criminal alien will not be removed, then Arizona officers&para;<br>are presumably no longer authorized under §6 to arrest&para;<br>the alien.&para;<br>To be sure, not all offenses for which officers have authority to arrest under §6 are covered by §1226(c)(1). As&para;<br>for aliens who have committed those offenses, Congress&para;<br>has given the Executive discretion under §1226(a) over&para;<br>whether to arrest and detain them pending a decision on&para;<br>removal. But the mere fact that the Executive has enforcement discretion cannot mean that the exercise of&para;<br>state police powers in support of federal law is automatically pre-empted. If that were true, then state and local&para;<br>officers could never make arrests to enforce any federal&para;<br>statute because the Executive always has at least some&para;<br>general discretion over the enforcement of federal law as a&para;<br>practical matter. But even assuming that the express&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>statutory grant of discretion in §1226(a) somehow indicates a congressional desire to pre-empt unilateral state&para;<br>and local authority to arrest criminal aliens covered by&para;<br>that provision, §6 is not pre-empted on its face given its&para;<br>substantial overlap with §1226(c)(1).&para;<br>It bears emphasizing that §6 does not mandate the&para;<br>warrantless apprehension of all aliens who have committed crimes for which they are removable. Instead, it only&para;<br>grants state and local officers permission to make such&para;<br>arrests. The trouble with this premature, facial challenge&para;<br>is that it affords Arizona no opportunity to implement&para;<br>its law in a way that would avoid any potential conflicts&para;<br>with federal law. For example, Arizona could promulgate&para;<br>guidelines or regulations limiting the arrest authority&para;<br>conferred by §6 to the crimes specified in §1226(c)(1). And&para;<br>to the extent §1226(c)(1) is unclear about which exact&para;<br>crimes are covered,3 Arizona could go even further and&para;<br>identify specific crimes for which there is no doubt an&para;<br>alien would be removable. The point is that there are&para;<br>plenty of permissible applications of §6, and the Court&para;<br>should not invalidate the statute at this point without at&para;<br>least some indication that Arizona has implemented it in a&para;<br>manner at odds with Congress’ clear and manifest intent.&para;<br>We have said that a facial challenge to a statute is “the&para;<br>most difficult challenge to mount successfully” because “the&para;<br>challenger must establish that no set of circumstances&para;<br>exists under which the [statute] would be valid.” United&para;<br>States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987); see also&para;<br>Anderson v. Edwards, 514 U. S. 143, 155, n. 6 (1995)&para;<br>(applying the Salerno standard in a pre-emption case). As&para;<br>to §6, I do not believe the United States has carried that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3I&para;<br>&para;<br>readily admit that it can be difficult to determine whether a&para;<br>particular conviction will necessarily make an alien removable.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>heavy burden.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Finally, the Court tells us that §6 conflicts with federal&para;<br>law because it provides state and local officers with “even&para;<br>greater authority to arrest aliens on the basis of possible&para;<br>removability than Congress has given to trained federal&para;<br>immigration officers.” Ante, at 16–17. The Court points to&para;<br>8 U. S. C. §1357(a)(2), which empowers “authorized” officers and employees of ICE to make arrests without a federal warrant if “the alien so arrested is in the United States&para;<br>in violation of any [immigration] law or regulation and is&para;<br>likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his&para;<br>arrest.” Because §6 would allow Arizona officers to make&para;<br>arrests “regardless of whether a federal warrant has&para;<br>issued or the alien is likely to escape,” ante, at 17, the&para;<br>Court concludes that §6 is an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress’ objectives. But §6 is an obstacle only to&para;<br>the extent it conflicts with Congress’ clear and manifest&para;<br>intent to preclude state and local officers from making&para;<br>arrests except where a federal warrant has issued or the&para;<br>arrestee is likely to escape. By granting warrantless&para;<br>arrest authority to federal officers, Congress has not manifested an unmistakable intent to strip state and local&para;<br>officers of their warrantless arrest authority under state&para;<br>law.&para;<br>Likewise, limitations on federal arrest authority do not&para;<br>mean that the arrest authority of state and local officers&para;<br>must be similarly limited. Our opinion in Miller, 357 U. S.&para;<br>301, is instructive. In that case, a District of Columbia&para;<br>officer, accompanied by a federal officer, made an arrest&para;<br>based on a suspected federal narcotics offense. Id., at&para;<br>303–304. The federal officer did not have statutory authorization to arrest without a warrant, but the local&para;<br>officer did. Id., at 305. We held that District of Columbia&para;<br>law dictated the lawfulness of the arrest. Id., at 305–306.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Where a state or local officer makes a warrantless arrest&para;<br>to enforce federal law, we said that “the lawfulness of the&para;<br>arrest without warrant is to be determined by reference to&para;<br>state law.” Id., at 305. Under §6, an Arizona officer may&para;<br>be authorized to make an arrest that a federal officer may&para;<br>not be authorized to make under §1357(a)(2). As Miller&para;<br>makes clear, that fact alone does not render arrests by&para;<br>state or local officers pursuant to §6 unlawful. Nor does it&para;<br>manifest a clear congressional intent to displace the exercise of state police powers that are brought to bear in aid&para;<br>of federal law.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
