Argued February 26, 2014 —Decided April 29, 2014&para;<br>Petitioner Highmark Inc. moved for fees under the Patent Act’s feeshifting provision, which authorizes a district court to award attorney’s fees to the prevailing party in “exceptional cases.” 35 U.

The Federal Circuit, reviewing the District&para;<br>Court’s determination de novo, reversed in part.&para;<br>Held: All aspects of a district court’s exceptional-case determination&para;<br>under §285 should be reviewed for abuse of discretion. Prior to Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health &amp; Fitness, Inc., ante, p. ___, this&para;<br>determination was governed by the framework established by the&para;<br>Federal Circuit in Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int’l, Inc.,&para;<br>393 F. 3d 1378. Octane rejects the Brooks Furniture framework as&para;<br>unduly rigid and holds that district courts may make the exceptionalcase determination under §285 in the exercise of their discretion.&para;<br>The holding in Octane settles this case. Decisions on “matters of discretion” are traditionally “reviewable for ‘abuse of discretion,’ ” Pierce&para;<br>v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558, and this Court previously has held&para;<br>that to be the proper standard of review in cases involving similar determinations, see, e.g., id., at 559; Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp.,&para;<br>496 U. S. 384, 405. The exceptional-case determination is based on&para;<br>statutory text that “emphasizes the fact that the determination is for&para;<br>the district court,” Pierce, 487 U. S., at 559; that court “is better positioned” to make the determination, id., at 560; and the determination&para;<br>is “multifarious and novel,” not susceptible to “useful generalization”&para;<br>of the sort that de novo review provides, and “likely to profit from the&para;<br>experience that an abuse-of discretion rule will permit to develop,”&para;<br>id., at 562.

ALLCARE HEALTH&para;<br>MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, INC.&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[April 29, 2014] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>Section 285 of the Patent Act provides: “The court in&para;<br>exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to&para;<br>the prevailing party.” 35 U. S. C. §285. In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int’l, Inc., 393 F. 3d 1378&para;<br>(2005), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal&para;<br>Circuit interpreted §285 as authorizing fee awards only in&para;<br>two circumstances. It held that “[a] case may be deemed&para;<br>exceptional” under §285 “when there has been some material inappropriate conduct,” or when it is both “brought in&para;<br>subjective bad faith” and “objectively baseless.” Id., at&para;<br>1381. We granted certiorari to determine whether an&para;<br>appellate court should accord deference to a district court’s&para;<br>determination that litigation is “objectively baseless.” On&para;<br>the basis of our opinion in Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON&para;<br>Health &amp; Fitness, Inc., ante, p. ___, argued together with&para;<br>this case and also issued today, we hold that an appellate&para;<br>court should review all aspects of a district court’s §285&para;<br>determination for abuse of discretion.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Allcare Health Management System, Inc., owns U. S.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HIGHMARK INC. v. ALLCARE HEALTH MANAGEMENT&para;<br>SYSTEM, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Patent No. 5,301,105 (’105 patent), which covers “utilization review” in “ ‘managed health care systems.’ ”1 687&para;<br>F. 3d 1300, 1306 (CA Fed 2012). Highmark Inc., a health&para;<br>insurance company, sued Allcare seeking a declaratory&para;<br>judgment that the ’105 patent was invalid and unenforceable and that, to the extent it was valid, Highmark’s&para;<br>actions were not infringing it. Allcare counterclaimed for&para;<br>patent infringement. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, and the District Court entered a final&para;<br>judgment of noninfringement in favor of Highmark. The&para;<br>Federal Circuit affirmed. 329 Fed. Appx. 280 (2009) (per&para;<br>curiam).&para;<br>Highmark then moved for fees under §285. The District&para;<br>Court granted Highmark’s motion. 706 F. Supp. 2d 713&para;<br>(ND Tex. 2010). The court reasoned that Allcare had&para;<br>engaged in a pattern of “vexatious” and “deceitful” conduct&para;<br>throughout the litigation. Id., at 737. Specifically, it&para;<br>found that Allcare had “pursued this suit as part of a&para;<br>bigger plan to identify companies potentially infringing&para;<br>the ’105 patent under the guise of an informational survey, and then to force those companies to purchase a&para;<br>license of the ’105 patent under threat of litigation.” Id.,&para;<br>at 736–737. And it found that Allcare had “maintained&para;<br>infringement claims [against Highmark] well after such&para;<br>claims had been shown by its own experts to be without&para;<br>merit” and had “asserted defenses it and its attorneys&para;<br>knew to be frivolous.” Id., at 737. In a subsequent opinion, the District Court fixed the amount of the award at&para;<br>$4,694,727.40 in attorney’s fees and $209,626.56 in expenses, in addition to $375,400.05 in expert fees. 2010 WL&para;<br>6432945, *7 (ND Tex., Nov. 5, 2010).&para;<br>The Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 “ ‘Utilization review’ is the process of determining whether a health&para;<br>insurer should approve a particular treatment for a patient.” 687 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 1306.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>part. 687 F. 3d 1300. It affirmed the District Court’s&para;<br>exceptional-case determination with respect to the allegations that Highmark’s system infringed one claim of the&para;<br>’105 patent, id., at 1311–1313, but reversed the determination with respect to another claim of the patent, id., at&para;<br>1313–1315. In reversing the exceptional-case determination as to one claim, the court reviewed it de novo. The&para;<br>court held that because the question whether litigation is&para;<br>“objectively baseless” under Brooks Furniture “ ‘is a question of law based on underlying mixed questions of law&para;<br>and fact,’ ” an objective-baselessness determination is&para;<br>reviewed on appeal “ ‘de novo’ ” and “without deference.”&para;<br>687 F. 3d, at 1309; see also ibid., n. 1. It then determined,&para;<br>contrary to the judgment of the District Court, that “Allcare’s argument” as to claim construction “was not ‘so&para;<br>unreasonable that no reasonable litigant could believe it&para;<br>would succeed.’ ” Id., at 1315. The court further found&para;<br>that none of Allcare’s conduct warranted an award of fees&para;<br>under the litigation-misconduct prong of Brooks Furniture.&para;<br>687 F. 3d, at 1315–1319.&para;<br>Judge Mayer dissented in part, disagreeing with the&para;<br>view “that no deference is owed to a district court’s finding&para;<br>that the infringement claims asserted by a litigant at trial&para;<br>were objectively unreasonable.” Id., at 1319. He would&para;<br>have held that “reasonableness is a finding of fact which&para;<br>may be set aside only for clear error.” Ibid. The Federal&para;<br>Circuit denied rehearing en banc, over the dissent of five&para;<br>judges. 701 F. 3d 1351 (2012). The dissenting judges&para;<br>criticized the court’s decision to adopt a de novo standard&para;<br>of review for the “objectively baseless” determination as an&para;<br>impermissible invasion of the province of the district&para;<br>court. Id., at 1357.&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 570 U. S. ___ (2013), and now&para;<br>vacate and remand.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HIGHMARK INC. v. ALLCARE HEALTH MANAGEMENT &para;<br>&para;<br>SYSTEM, INC.&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>II&para;<br>Our opinion in Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health &amp;&para;<br>Fitness, Inc., rejects the Brooks Furniture framework as&para;<br>unduly rigid and inconsistent with the text of §285. It&para;<br>holds, instead, that the word “exceptional” in §285 should&para;<br>be interpreted in accordance with its ordinary meaning.&para;<br>Ante, at 7. An “exceptional” case, it explains, “is simply&para;<br>one that stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a party’s litigating position (considering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the&para;<br>unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.”&para;<br>Ante, at 7–8. And it instructs that “[d]istrict courts may&para;<br>determine whether a case is ‘exceptional’ in the case-bycase exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of&para;<br>the circumstances.” Ante, at 8. Our holding in Octane&para;<br>settles this case: Because §285 commits the determination&para;<br>whether a case is “exceptional” to the discretion of the&para;<br>district court, that decision is to be reviewed on appeal for&para;<br>abuse of discretion.&para;<br>Traditionally, decisions on “questions of law” are “reviewable de novo,” decisions on “questions of fact” are&para;<br>“reviewable for clear error,” and decisions on “matters of&para;<br>discretion” are “reviewable for ‘abuse of discretion.’ ”&para;<br>Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558 (1988). For reasons we explain in Octane, the determination whether a&para;<br>case is “exceptional” under §285 is a matter of discretion.&para;<br>And as in our prior cases involving similar determinations, the exceptional-case determination is to be reviewed&para;<br>only for abuse of discretion.2 See Pierce, 487 U. S., at 559&para;<br>(determinations whether a litigating position is “substan——————&para;<br>2 The abuse-of-discretion standard does not preclude an appellate&para;<br>court’s correction of a district court’s legal or factual error: “A district&para;<br>court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an&para;<br>erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the&para;<br>evidence.” Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 405 (1990).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S.&para;<br>384, 405 (1990) (sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil&para;<br>Procedure 11 are to be reviewed for abuse of discretion).&para;<br>As in Pierce, the text of the statute “emphasizes the fact&para;<br>that the determination is for the district court,” which&para;<br>“suggests some deference to the district court upon appeal,” 487 U. S., at 559. As in Pierce, “as a matter of the&para;<br>sound administration of justice,” the district court “is&para;<br>better positioned” to decide whether a case is exceptional,&para;<br>id., at 559–560, because it lives with the case over a prolonged period of time. And as in Pierce, the question is&para;<br>“multifarious and novel,” not susceptible to “useful generalization” of the sort that de novo review provides, and&para;<br>“likely to profit from the experience that an abuse-ofdiscretion rule will permit to develop,” id., at 562.&para;<br>We therefore hold that an appellate court should apply&para;<br>an abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing all aspects of&para;<br>a district court’s §285 determination. Although questions&para;<br>of law may in some cases be relevant to the §285 inquiry,&para;<br>that inquiry generally is, at heart, “rooted in factual determinations,” Cooter, 496 U. S., at 401.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for&para;<br>the Federal Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded&para;<br>for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
