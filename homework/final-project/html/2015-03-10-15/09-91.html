JEREMY FISHER&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS OF MICHIGAN&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 09–91. Decided December 7, 2009 &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>Police officers responded to a complaint of a disturbance&para;<br>near Allen Road in Brownstown, Michigan.* Officer Chris&para;<br>topher Goolsby later testified that, as he and his partner&para;<br>approached the area, a couple directed them to a residence&para;<br>where a man was “going crazy.” Docket No. 276439, 2008&para;<br>WL 786515, *1 (Mich. App., Mar. 25, 2008) (per curiam)&para;<br>(alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). Upon&para;<br>their arrival, the officers found a household in consider&para;<br>able chaos: a pickup truck in the driveway with its front&para;<br>smashed, damaged fenceposts along the side of the prop&para;<br>erty, and three broken house windows, the glass still on&para;<br>the ground outside. The officers also noticed blood on the&para;<br>hood of the pickup and on clothes inside of it, as well as on&para;<br>one of the doors to the house. (It is disputed whether they&para;<br>noticed this immediately upon reaching the house, but&para;<br>undisputed that they noticed it before the allegedly uncon&para;<br>stitutional entry.) Through a window, the officers could&para;<br>see respondent, Jeremy Fisher, inside the house, scream&para;<br>ing and throwing things. The back door was locked, and a&para;<br>couch had been placed to block the front door.&para;<br>The officers knocked, but Fisher refused to answer.&para;<br>They saw that Fisher had a cut on his hand, and they&para;<br>asked him whether he needed medical attention. Fisher&para;<br>ignored these questions and demanded, with accompany&para;<br>ing profanity, that the officers go to get a search warrant.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* We have taken the facts from the opinion of the Michigan Court of&para;<br>Appeals. Except where indicated, the parties do not dispute the facts.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. FISHER&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Officer Goolsby then pushed the front door partway open&para;<br>and ventured into the house. Through the window of the&para;<br>open door he saw Fisher pointing a long gun at him.&para;<br>Officer Goolsby withdrew.&para;<br>Fisher was charged under Michigan law with assault&para;<br>with a dangerous weapon and possession of a firearm&para;<br>during the commission of a felony. The trial court con&para;<br>cluded that Officer Goolsby violated the Fourth Amend&para;<br>ment when he entered Fisher’s house, and granted&para;<br>Fisher’s motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a&para;<br>result—that is, Officer Goolsby’s statement that Fisher&para;<br>pointed a rifle at him. The Michigan Court of Appeals&para;<br>initially remanded for an evidentiary hearing, see Docket&para;<br>No. 256027, 2005 WL 3481454 (Dec. 20, 2005) (per cu&para;<br>riam), after which the trial court reinstated its order. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals then affirmed over a dissent by Judge&para;<br>Talbot. See 2008 WL 786515, at *2; id., at *2–*5. The&para;<br>Michigan Supreme Court granted leave to appeal, but,&para;<br>after hearing oral argument, it vacated its prior order and&para;<br>denied leave instead; three justices, however, would have&para;<br>taken the case and reversed on the ground that the Court&para;<br>of Appeals misapplied the Fourth Amendment. See 483&para;<br>Mich. 1007, 765 N. W. 2d 19 (2009). Because the decision&para;<br>of the Michigan Court of Appeals is indeed contrary to our&para;<br>Fourth Amendment case law, particularly Brigham City v.&para;<br>Stuart, 547 U. S. 398 (2006), we grant the State’s petition&para;<br>for certiorari and reverse.&para;<br>“[T]he ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment,”&para;<br>we have often said, “is ‘reasonableness.’ ” Id., at 403.&para;<br>Therefore, although “searches and seizures inside a home&para;<br>without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable,” Groh&para;<br>v. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551, 559 (2004) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted), that presumption can be overcome. For&para;<br>example, “the exigencies of the situation [may] make the&para;<br>needs of law enforcement so compelling that the war&para;<br>rantless search is objectively reasonable.” Mincey v. Ari&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>zona, 437 U. S. 385, 393–394 (1978).&para;<br>Brigham City identified one such exigency: “the need to&para;<br>assist persons who are seriously injured or threatened&para;<br>with such injury.” 547 U. S., at 403. Thus, law enforce&para;<br>ment officers “may enter a home without a warrant to&para;<br>render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to&para;<br>protect an occupant from imminent injury.” Ibid. This&para;<br>“emergency aid exception” does not depend on the officers’&para;<br>subjective intent or the seriousness of any crime they are&para;<br>investigating when the emergency arises. Id., at 404–405.&para;<br>It requires only “an objectively reasonable basis for believ&para;<br>ing,” id., at 406, that “a person within [the house] is in&para;<br>need of immediate aid,” Mincey, supra, at 392.&para;<br>Brigham City illustrates the application of this stan&para;<br>dard. There, police officers responded to a noise complaint&para;<br>in the early hours of the morning. “As they approached&para;<br>the house, they could hear from within an altercation&para;<br>occurring, some kind of fight.” 547 U. S., at 406 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). Following the tumult to the&para;<br>back of the house whence it came, the officers saw juve&para;<br>niles drinking beer in the backyard and a fight unfolding&para;<br>in the kitchen. They watched through the window as a&para;<br>juvenile broke free from the adults restraining him and&para;<br>punched another adult in the face, who recoiled to the&para;<br>sink, spitting blood. Ibid. Under these circumstances, we&para;<br>found it “plainly reasonable” for the officers to enter the&para;<br>house and quell the violence, for they had “an objectively&para;<br>reasonable basis for believing both that the injured adult&para;<br>might need help and that the violence in the kitchen was&para;<br>just beginning.” Ibid.&para;<br>A straightforward application of the emergency aid&para;<br>exception, as in Brigham City, dictates that the officer’s&para;<br>entry was reasonable. Just as in Brigham City, the police&para;<br>officers here were responding to a report of a disturbance.&para;<br>Just as in Brigham City, when they arrived on the scene&para;<br>they encountered a tumultuous situation in the house—&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. FISHER&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>and here they also found signs of a recent injury, perhaps&para;<br>from a car accident, outside. And just as in Brigham City,&para;<br>the officers could see violent behavior inside. Although&para;<br>Officer Goolsby and his partner did not see punches&para;<br>thrown, as did the officers in Brigham City, they did see&para;<br>Fisher screaming and throwing things. It would be objec&para;<br>tively reasonable to believe that Fisher’s projectiles might&para;<br>have a human target (perhaps a spouse or a child), or that&para;<br>Fisher would hurt himself in the course of his rage. In&para;<br>short, we find it as plain here as we did in Brigham City&para;<br>that the officer’s entry was reasonable under the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment.&para;<br>The Michigan Court of Appeals, however, thought the&para;<br>situation “did not rise to a level of emergency justifying&para;<br>the warrantless intrusion into a residence.” 2008 WL&para;<br>786515, at *2. Although the Court of Appeals conceded&para;<br>that “there was evidence an injured person was on the&para;<br>premises,” it found it significant that “the mere drops of&para;<br>blood did not signal a likely serious, life-threatening in&para;<br>jury.” Ibid. The court added that the cut Officer Goolsby&para;<br>observed on Fisher’s hand “likely explained the trail of&para;<br>blood” and that Fisher “was very much on his feet and&para;<br>apparently able to see to his own needs.” Ibid.&para;<br>Even a casual review of Brigham City reveals the flaw&para;<br>in this reasoning. Officers do not need ironclad proof of “a&para;<br>likely serious, life-threatening” injury to invoke the emer&para;<br>gency aid exception. The only injury police could confirm&para;<br>in Brigham City was the bloody lip they saw the juvenile&para;<br>inflict upon the adult. Fisher argues that the officers here&para;<br>could not have been motivated by a perceived need to&para;<br>provide medical assistance, since they never summoned&para;<br>emergency medical personnel. This would have no bear&para;<br>ing, of course, upon their need to assure that Fisher was&para;<br>not endangering someone else in the house. Moreover,&para;<br>even if the failure to summon medical personnel conclu&para;<br>sively established that Goolsby did not subjectively be&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>lieve, when he entered the house, that Fisher or someone&para;<br>else was seriously injured (which is doubtful), the test, as&para;<br>we have said, is not what Goolsby believed, but whether&para;<br>there was “an objectively reasonable basis for believing”&para;<br>that medical assistance was needed, or persons were in&para;<br>danger, Brigham City, supra, at 406; Mincey, supra, at&para;<br>392.&para;<br>It was error for the Michigan Court of Appeals to re&para;<br>place that objective inquiry into appearances with its&para;<br>hindsight determination that there was in fact no emer&para;<br>gency. It does not meet the needs of law enforcement or&para;<br>the demands of public safety to require officers to walk&para;<br>away from a situation like the one they encountered here.&para;<br>Only when an apparent threat has become an actual harm&para;<br>can officers rule out innocuous explanations for ominous&para;<br>circumstances. But “[t]he role of a peace officer includes&para;<br>preventing violence and restoring order, not simply ren&para;<br>dering first aid to casualties.” Brigham City, supra, at&para;<br>406. It sufficed to invoke the emergency aid exception&para;<br>that it was reasonable to believe that Fisher had hurt&para;<br>himself (albeit nonfatally) and needed treatment that in&para;<br>his rage he was unable to provide, or that Fisher was&para;<br>about to hurt, or had already hurt, someone else. The&para;<br>Michigan Court of Appeals required more than what the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment demands.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of&para;<br>the Michigan Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is&para;<br>remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with&para;<br>this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>1&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. JEREMY FISHER&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS OF MICHIGAN&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 09–91. Decided December 7, 2009 &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR&para;<br>joins, dissenting.&para;<br>On October 31, 2003, Jeremy Fisher pointed a rifle at&para;<br>Officer Christopher Goolsby when Goolsby attempted to&para;<br>force his way into Fisher’s home without a warrant.&para;<br>Fisher was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon&para;<br>and possession of a dangerous weapon during the commis&para;<br>sion of a felony. The charges were dismissed after the&para;<br>trial judge granted a motion to suppress evidence of the&para;<br>assault because it was the product of Goolsby’s unlawful&para;<br>entry. In 2005 the Michigan Court of Appeals held that&para;<br>the trial court had erred because it had decided the sup&para;<br>pression motion without conducting a full evidentiary&para;<br>hearing. On remand, the trial court conducted such a&para;<br>hearing and again granted the motion to suppress.&para;<br>As a matter of Michigan law it is well settled that police&para;<br>officers may enter a home without a warrant “when they&para;<br>reasonably believe that a person within is in need of im&para;<br>mediate aid.” People v. Davis, 442 Mich. 1, 25, 497 N. W.&para;<br>2d 910, 921 (1993). We have stated the rule in the same&para;<br>way under federal law, Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385,&para;<br>392 (1978), and have explained that a warrantless entry is&para;<br>justified by the “ ‘need to protect or preserve life or avoid&para;<br>serious injury,’ ” ibid. The State bears the burden of proof&para;<br>on that factual issue and relied entirely on the testimony&para;<br>of Officer Goolsby in its attempt to carry that burden.&para;<br>Since three years had passed, Goolsby was not sure about&para;<br>certain facts—such as whether Fisher had a cut on his&para;<br>hand—but he did remember that Fisher repeatedly swore&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MICHIGAN v. FISHER&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>at the officers and told them to get a warrant, and that&para;<br>Fisher was screaming and throwing things. Goolsby also&para;<br>testified that he saw “mere drops” of blood outside Fisher’s&para;<br>home, No. 276439, 2008 WL 786515, *2 (Mich. App., Mar.&para;<br>25, 2008) (per curiam) (summarizing Goolsby’s testimony),&para;<br>and that he did not ask whether anyone else was inside.&para;<br>Goolsby did not testify that he had any reason to believe&para;<br>that anyone else was in the house. Thus, the factual&para;<br>question was whether Goolsby had “an objectively reason&para;<br>able basis for believing that [Fisher was] seriously injured&para;<br>or imminently threatened with such injury.” Brigham&para;<br>City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 400 (2006).&para;<br>After hearing the testimony, the trial judge was “even&para;<br>more convinced” that the entry was unlawful. Tr. 29 (Dec.&para;<br>19, 2006). He noted the issue was “whether or not there&para;<br>was a reasonable basis to [enter the house] or whether&para;<br>[Goolsby] was just acting on some possibilities,” id., at 22,&para;<br>and evidently found the record supported the latter rather&para;<br>than the former. He found the police decision to leave the&para;<br>scene and not return for several hours—without resolving&para;<br>any potentially dangerous situation and without calling&para;<br>for medical assistance—inconsistent with a reasonable&para;<br>belief that Fisher was in need of immediate aid. In sum,&para;<br>the one judge who heard Officer Goolsby’s testimony was&para;<br>not persuaded that Goolsby had an objectively reasonable&para;<br>basis for believing that entering Fisher’s home was neces&para;<br>sary to avoid serious injury.&para;<br>The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding&para;<br>that the State had not met its burden. Perhaps because&para;<br>one judge dissented, the Michigan Supreme Court initially&para;<br>granted an application for leave to appeal. After consider&para;<br>ing briefs and oral argument, however, the majority of&para;<br>that Court vacated its earlier order because it was “no&para;<br>longer persuaded that the questions presented should be&para;<br>reviewed by this Court.” 483 Mich. 1007, 765 N.
