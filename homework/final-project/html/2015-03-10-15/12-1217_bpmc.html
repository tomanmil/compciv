<span>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>1&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>MIKE STANTON, PETITIONER v. DRENDOLYN SIMS&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 12–1217. Decided November 4, 2013&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>Around one o’clock in the morning on May 27, 2008,&para;<br>Officer Mike Stanton and his partner responded to a call&para;<br>about an “unknown disturbance” involving a person with a&para;<br>baseball bat in La Mesa, California. App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 6. Stanton was familiar with the neighborhood, known&para;<br>for “violence associated with the area gangs.” Ibid. The&para;<br>officers—wearing uniforms and driving a marked police&para;<br>vehicle—approached the place where the disturbance had&para;<br>been reported and noticed three men walking in the street.&para;<br>Upon seeing the police car, two of the men turned into a&para;<br>nearby apartment complex. The third, Nicholas Patrick,&para;<br>crossed the street about 25 yards in front of Stanton’s car&para;<br>and ran or quickly walked toward a residence. Id., at 7,&para;<br>17. Nothing in the record shows that Stanton knew at the&para;<br>time whether that residence belonged to Patrick or someone else; in fact, it belonged to Drendolyn Sims.&para;<br>Stanton did not see Patrick with a baseball bat, but&para;<br>he considered Patrick’s behavior suspicious and decided&para;<br>to detain him in order to investigate. Ibid.; see Terry v.&para;<br>Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968). Stanton exited his patrol car,&para;<br>called out “police,” and ordered Patrick to stop in a voice&para;<br>loud enough for all in the area to hear. App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 7. But Patrick did not stop. Instead, he “looked&para;<br>directly at Stanton, ignored his lawful orders[,] and quickly&para;<br>went through [the] front gate” of a fence enclosing Sims’&para;<br>front yard. Id., at 17 (alterations omitted). When the gate&para;<br>closed behind Patrick, the fence—which was more than six&para;<br>feet tall and made of wood—blocked Stanton’s view of the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>STANTON v. SIMS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>yard. Stanton believed that Patrick had committed a&para;<br>jailable misdemeanor under California Penal Code §148 by&para;<br>disobeying his order to stop;* Stanton also “fear[ed] for&para;<br>[his] safety.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 7. He accordingly&para;<br>made the “split-second decision” to kick open the gate in&para;<br>pursuit of Patrick. Ibid. Unfortunately, and unbeknownst&para;<br>to Stanton, Sims herself was standing behind the gate&para;<br>when it flew open. The swinging gate struck Sims, cutting&para;<br>her forehead and injuring her shoulder.&para;<br>Sims filed suit against Stanton in Federal District Court&para;<br>under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging that&para;<br>Stanton unreasonably searched her home without a warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District&para;<br>Court granted summary judgment to Stanton, finding&para;<br>that: (1) Stanton’s entry was justified by the potentially&para;<br>dangerous situation, by the need to pursue Patrick as he&para;<br>fled, and by Sims’ lesser expectation of privacy in the&para;<br>curtilage of her home; and (2) even if a constitutional&para;<br>violation had occurred, Stanton was entitled to qualified&para;<br>immunity because no clearly established law put him on&para;<br>notice that his conduct was unconstitutional.&para;<br>Sims appealed, and a panel of the Court of Appeals for&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit reversed. 706 F. 3d 954 (2013). The&para;<br>court held that Stanton’s warrantless entry into Sims’&para;<br>yard was unconstitutional because Sims was entitled to&para;<br>the same expectation of privacy in her curtilage as in her&para;<br>home itself, because there was no immediate danger, and&para;<br>because Patrick had committed only the minor offense of&para;<br>disobeying a police officer. Id., at 959–963. The court also&para;<br>found the law to be clearly established that Stanton’s&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* “Every person who willfully resists, delays, or obstructs any . . .&para;<br>peace officer . . . in the discharge or attempt to discharge any duty of&para;<br>his or her office or employment . . . shall be punished by a fine not&para;<br>exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by imprisonment in a&para;<br>county jail not to exceed one year, or by both that fine and imprisonment.” Cal. Penal Code Ann. §148(a)(1) (2013 West Cum. Supp.).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>pursuit of Patrick did not justify his warrantless entry,&para;<br>given that Patrick was suspected of only a misdemeanor.&para;<br>Id., at 963–964. The court accordingly held that Stanton&para;<br>was not entitled to qualified immunity. Id., at 964–965.&para;<br>We address only the latter holding here, and now reverse.&para;<br>“The doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials ‘from liability for civil damages insofar as&para;<br>their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory&para;<br>or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person&para;<br>would have known.’ ” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223,&para;<br>231 (2009) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800,&para;<br>818 (1982)). “Qualified immunity gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken&para;<br>judgments,” and “protects ‘all but the plainly incompetent&para;<br>or those who knowingly violate the law.’ ” Ashcroft v. alKidd, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (quoting&para;<br>Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 341 (1986)). “We do not&para;<br>require a case directly on point” before concluding that the&para;<br>law is clearly established, “but existing precedent must&para;<br>have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.” al-Kidd, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).&para;<br>There is no suggestion in this case that Officer Stanton&para;<br>knowingly violated the Constitution; the question is&para;<br>whether, in light of precedent existing at the time, he was&para;<br>“plainly incompetent” in entering Sims’ yard to pursue the&para;<br>fleeing Patrick. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12). The Ninth&para;<br>Circuit concluded that he was. It did so despite the fact&para;<br>that federal and state courts nationwide are sharply divided on the question whether an officer with probable&para;<br>cause to arrest a suspect for a misdemeanor may enter a&para;<br>home without a warrant while in hot pursuit of that suspect. Compare, e.g., Middletown v. Flinchum, 95 Ohio St.&para;<br>3d 43, 45, 765 N. E. 2d 330, 332 (2002) (“We . . . hold today&para;<br>that when officers, having identified themselves, are in&para;<br>hot pursuit of a suspect who flees to a house in order to&para;<br>avoid arrest, the police may enter without a warrant,&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>STANTON v. SIMS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>regardless of whether the offense for which the suspect is&para;<br>being arrested is a misdemeanor”), and State v. Ricci, 144&para;<br>N. H. 241, 244, 739 A. 2d 404, 407 (1999) (“the facts of this&para;<br>case demonstrate that the police had probable cause to&para;<br>arrest the defendant for the misdemeanor offense of disobeying a police officer” where the defendant had fled&para;<br>into his home with police officers in hot pursuit), with Mascorro v. Billings, 656 F. 3d 1198, 1207 (CA10 2011) (“The&para;<br>warrantless entry based on hot pursuit was not justified”&para;<br>where “[t]he intended arrest was for a traffic misdemeanor&para;<br>committed by a minor, with whom the officer was well&para;<br>acquainted, who had fled into his family home from which&para;<br>there was only one exit” (footnote omitted)), and Butler v.&para;<br>State, 309 Ark. 211, 217, 829 S. W. 2d 412, 415 (1992)&para;<br>(“even though Officer Sudduth might have been under the&para;<br>impression that he was in continuous pursuit of Butler for&para;<br>what he considered to be the crime of disorderly conduct,&para;<br>. . . since the crime is a minor offense, under these circumstances there is no exigent circumstance that would allow&para;<br>Officer Sudduth’s warrantless entry into Butler’s home for&para;<br>what is concededly, at most, a petty disturbance”).&para;<br>Other courts have concluded that police officers are at&para;<br>least entitled to qualified immunity in these circumstances&para;<br>because the constitutional violation is not clearly established. E.g., Grenier v. Champlin, 27 F. 3d 1346, 1354&para;<br>(CA8 1994) (“Putting firmly to one side the merits of&para;<br>whether the home arrests were constitutional, we cannot&para;<br>say that only a plainly incompetent policeman could have&para;<br>thought them permissible at the time,” where officers&para;<br>entered a home without a warrant in hot pursuit of misdemeanor suspects who had defied the officers’ order to&para;<br>remain outside (internal quotation marks and citation&para;<br>omitted)).&para;<br>Notwithstanding this basic disagreement, the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit below denied Stanton qualified immunity. In its&para;<br>one-paragraph analysis on the hot pursuit point, the panel&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>relied on two cases, one from this Court, Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U. S. 740, 750 (1984), and one from its own, United&para;<br>States v. Johnson, 256 F. 3d 895, 908 (2001) (en banc)&para;<br>(per curiam). Neither case clearly establishes that Stanton violated Sims’ Fourth Amendment rights.&para;<br>In Welsh, police officers learned from a witness that&para;<br>Edward Welsh had driven his car off the road and then&para;<br>left the scene, presumably because he was drunk. Acting&para;<br>on that tip, the officers went to Welsh’s home without a&para;<br>warrant, entered without consent, and arrested him for&para;<br>driving while intoxicated—a nonjailable traffic offense&para;<br>under state law. 466 U. S., at 742–743. Our opinion first&para;<br>noted our precedent holding that hot pursuit of a fleeing&para;<br>felon justifies an officer’s warrantless entry. Id., at 750&para;<br>(citing United States v. Santana, 427 U. S. 38, 42–43&para;<br>(1976)). But we rejected the suggestion that the hot pursuit exception applied: “there was no immediate or continuous pursuit of [Welsh] from the scene of a crime.” 466&para;<br>U. S., at 753. We went on to conclude that the officers’&para;<br>entry violated the Fourth Amendment, finding it “important” that “there [was] probable cause to believe that&para;<br>only a minor offense . . . ha[d] been committed.” Ibid. In&para;<br>those circumstances, we said, “application of the exigentcircumstances exception in the context of a home entry&para;<br>should rarely be sanctioned.” Ibid. But we did not lay&para;<br>down a categorical rule for all cases involving minor offenses, saying only that a warrant is “usually” required.&para;<br>Id., at 750.&para;<br>In Johnson, police officers broke into Michael Johnson’s&para;<br>fenced yard in search of another person (Steven Smith)&para;<br>whom they were attempting to apprehend on five misdemeanor arrest warrants. 256 F. 3d, at 898–900. The&para;<br>Ninth Circuit was clear that this case, like Welsh, did not&para;<br>involve hot pursuit: “the facts of this case simply are not&para;<br>covered by the ‘hot pursuit’ doctrine” because Smith had&para;<br>escaped from the police 30 minutes prior and his where-&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>STANTON v. SIMS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>abouts were unknown. 256 F. 3d, at 908. The court held&para;<br>that the officers’ entry required a warrant, in part because&para;<br>Smith was wanted for only misdemeanor offenses. Then,&para;<br>in a footnote, the court said: “In situations where an officer&para;<br>is truly in hot pursuit and the underlying offense is a&para;<br>felony, the Fourth Amendment usually yields [to law&para;<br>enforcement’s interest in apprehending a fleeing suspect].&para;<br>See [Santana, supra, at 42–43]. However, in situations&para;<br>where the underlying offense is only a misdemeanor, law&para;<br>enforcement must yield to the Fourth Amendment in all&para;<br>but the ‘rarest’ cases. Welsh, [supra, at 753].” Johnson,&para;<br>supra, at 908, n. 6.&para;<br>In concluding—as it must have—that Stanton was&para;<br>“plainly incompetent,” al-Kidd, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 12), the Ninth Circuit below read Welsh and the footnote in Johnson far too broadly. First, both of those cases&para;<br>cited Santana with approval, a case that approved an&para;<br>officer’s warrantless entry while in hot pursuit. And&para;<br>though Santana involved a felony suspect, we did not&para;<br>expressly limit our holding based on that fact. See 427&para;<br>U. S., at 42 (“The only remaining question is whether [the&para;<br>suspect’s] act of retreating into her house could thwart an&para;<br>otherwise proper arrest. We hold that it could not”).&para;<br>Second, to repeat, neither Welsh nor Johnson involved hot&para;<br>pursuit. Welsh, supra, at 753; Johnson, supra, at 908.&para;<br>Thus, despite our emphasis in Welsh on the fact that the&para;<br>crime at issue was minor—indeed, a mere nonjailable civil&para;<br>offense—nothing in the opinion establishes that the seriousness of the crime is equally important in cases of hot&para;<br>pursuit. Third, even in the portion of Welsh cited by the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit below, our opinion is equivocal: We held not&para;<br>that warrantless entry to arrest a misdemeanant is never&para;<br>justified, but only that such entry should be rare. 466&para;<br>U. S., at 753.&para;<br>That is in fact how two California state courts have read&para;<br>Welsh. In both People v. Lloyd, 216 Cal. App. 3d 1425,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>1430, 265 Cal. Rptr. 422, 425 (1989), and In re Lavoyne&para;<br>M., 221 Cal. App. 3d 154, 159, 270 Cal. Rptr. 394, 396&para;<br>(1990), the California Court of Appeal refused to limit the&para;<br>hot pursuit exception to felony suspects. The court stated&para;<br>in Lloyd: “Where the pursuit into the home was based on&para;<br>an arrest set in motion in a public place, the fact that the&para;<br>offenses justifying the initial detention or arrest were&para;<br>misdemeanors is of no significance in determining the&para;<br>validity of the entry without a warrant.” 216 Cal. App. 3d,&para;<br>at 1430, 265 Cal. Rptr., at 425. It is especially troubling&para;<br>that the Ninth Circuit would conclude that Stanton was&para;<br>plainly incompetent—and subject to personal liability for&para;<br>damages—based on actions that were lawful according&para;<br>to courts in the jurisdiction where he acted. Cf. al-Kidd,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2–4).&para;<br>Finally, our determination that Welsh and Johnson are&para;<br>insufficient to overcome Stanton’s qualified immunity is&para;<br>bolstered by the fact that, even after Johnson, two different District Courts in the Ninth Circuit have granted&para;<br>qualified immunity precisely because the law regarding&para;<br>warrantless entry in hot pursuit of a fleeing misdemeanant is not clearly established. See Kolesnikov v. Sacramento County, No. S–06–2155, 2008 WL 1806193, *7 (ED&para;<br>Cal., Apr. 22, 2008) (“since Welsh, it has not been clearly&para;<br>established that there can never be warrantless home&para;<br>arrests in the context of a ‘hot pursuit’ of a suspect fleeing&para;<br>from the commission of misdemeanor offenses”); Garcia v.&para;<br>Imperial, No. 08–2357, 2010 WL 3834020, *6, n. 4 (SD&para;<br>Cal., Sept. 28, 2010). In Garcia, a case with facts similar&para;<br>to those here, the District Court distinguished Johnson as&para;<br>a case where “the officers were not in hot pursuit of the&para;<br>suspect, had not seen the suspect enter the neighbor’s&para;<br>property, and had no real reason to think the suspect was&para;<br>there.” 2010 WL 3834020, *6, n. 4. Precisely the same&para;<br>facts distinguish this case from Johnson: Stanton was in&para;<br>hot pursuit of Patrick, he did see Patrick enter Sims’&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>STANTON v. SIMS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>property, and he had every reason to believe that Patrick&para;<br>was just beyond Sims’ gate. App. to Pet. for Cert. 6–7, 17.&para;<br>To summarize the law at the time Stanton made his&para;<br>split-second decision to enter Sims’ yard: Two opinions of&para;<br>this Court were equivocal on the lawfulness of his entry;&para;<br>two opinions of the State Court of Appeal affirmatively&para;<br>authorized that entry; the most relevant opinion of the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit was readily distinguishable; two Federal&para;<br>District Courts in the Ninth Circuit had granted qualified&para;<br>immunity in the wake of that opinion; and the federal and&para;<br>state courts of last resort around the Nation were sharply&para;<br>divided.&para;<br>We do not express any view on whether Officer Stanton’s entry into Sims’ yard in pursuit of Patrick was constitutional. But whether or not the constitutional rule&para;<br>applied by the court below was correct, it was not “beyond&para;<br>debate.” al-Kidd, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9). Stanton&para;<br>may have been mistaken in believing his actions were&para;<br>justified, but he was not “plainly incompetent.” Malley,&para;<br>475 U. S., at 341.&para;<br>The petition for certiorari and respondent’s motion for&para;<br>leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is&para;<br>remanded for further proceedings consistent with this&para;<br>opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
