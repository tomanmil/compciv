REED, WASHINGTON SECRETARY OF &para;<br>&para;<br>STATE, ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–559.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued April 28, 2010—Decided June 24, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>The Washington Constitution allows citizens to challenge state laws by&para;<br>referendum. To initiate a referendum, proponents must file a peti&para;<br>tion with the secretary of state that contains valid signatures of reg&para;<br>istered Washington voters equal to or exceeding four percent of the&para;<br>votes cast for the office of Governor at the last gubernatorial election.&para;<br>A valid submission requires not only a signature, but also the signer’s&para;<br>address and the county in which he is registered to vote.&para;<br>In May 2009, Washington Governor Christine Gregoire signed into&para;<br>law Senate Bill 5688, which expanded the rights and responsibilities&para;<br>of state-registered domestic partners, including same-sex domestic&para;<br>partners. That same month, Protect Marriage Washington, one of&para;<br>the petitioners here, was organized as a “State Political Committee”&para;<br>for the purpose of collecting the petition signatures necessary to place&para;<br>a referendum challenging SB 5688 on the ballot. If the referendum&para;<br>made it onto the ballot, Protect Marriage Washington planned to en&para;<br>courage voters to reject SB 5688. Protect Marriage Washington sub&para;<br>mitted the petition with more than 137,000 signatures to the secre&para;<br>tary of state, and after conducting the verification and canvassing&para;<br>process required by state law, the secretary determined that the peti&para;<br>tion contained sufficient signatures to qualify the referendum (R–71)&para;<br>for the ballot. Respondent intervenors invoked the Washington Pub&para;<br>lic Records Act (PRA) to obtain copies of the petition, which contained&para;<br>the signers’ names and addresses.&para;<br>The R–71 petition sponsor and certain signers filed a complaint&para;<br>and a motion for injunctive relief in Federal District Court, seeking to&para;<br>enjoin the public release of the petition. Count I alleges that the PRA&para;<br>“is unconstitutional as applied to referendum petitions,” and Count II&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>alleges that the PRA “is unconstitutional as applied to the Referen&para;<br>dum 71 petition because there is a reasonable probability that the&para;<br>signatories . . . will be subjected to threats, harassment, and repri&para;<br>sals.” Determining that the PRA burdened core political speech, the&para;<br>District Court held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits&para;<br>of Count I and granted a preliminary injunction preventing release of&para;<br>the signatory information. Reviewing only Count I, the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>held that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their claim that the&para;<br>PRA is unconstitutional as applied to referendum petitions in gen&para;<br>eral, and therefore reversed.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Disclosure of referendum petitions does not as a general matter&para;<br>violate the First Amendment. Pp. 4–13.&para;<br>(a) Because plaintiffs’ Count I claim and the relief that would fol&para;<br>low—an injunction barring the secretary of state from releasing ref&para;<br>erendum petitions to the public—reach beyond the particular circum&para;<br>stances of these plaintiffs, they must satisfy this Court’s standards&para;<br>for a facial challenge to the extent of that reach. See United States v.&para;<br>Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(b) The compelled disclosure of signatory information on referen&para;<br>dum petitions is subject to review under the First Amendment. In&para;<br>most cases, the individual’s signature will express the view that the&para;<br>law subject to the petition should be overturned. Even if the signer is&para;<br>agnostic as to the merits of the underlying law, his signature still ex&para;<br>presses the political view that the question should be considered “by&para;<br>the whole electorate.” Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 421. In either&para;<br>case, the expression of a political view implicates a First Amendment&para;<br>right.&para;<br>Petition signing remains expressive even when it has legal effect in&para;<br>the electoral process. But that does not mean that the electoral con&para;<br>text is irrelevant to the nature of this Court’s First Amendment re&para;<br>view. States have significant flexibility in implementing their own&para;<br>voting systems. To the extent a regulation concerns the legal effect of&para;<br>a particular activity in that process, the government is afforded sub&para;<br>stantial latitude to enforce that regulation. Also pertinent is the fact&para;<br>that the PRA is not a prohibition on speech, but a disclosure re&para;<br>quirement that may burden “the ability to speak, but [does] ‘not pre&para;<br>vent anyone from speaking.’ ” Citizens United v. Federal Election&para;<br>Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___, ___. This Court has reviewed First Amend&para;<br>ment challenges to disclosure requirements in the electoral context&para;<br>under an “exacting scrutiny” standard, requiring “a ‘substantial rela&para;<br>tion’ between the disclosure requirement and a ‘sufficiently impor&para;<br>tant’ governmental interest.” Id., at ___. To withstand this scrutiny,&para;<br>“the strength of the governmental interest must reflect the serious&para;<br>ness of the actual burden on First Amendment rights.” Davis v. Fed&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>eral Election Comm’n, 554 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>(c) The State’s interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral&para;<br>process suffices to defeat the argument that the PRA is unconstitu&para;<br>tional with respect to referendum petitions in general. That interest&para;<br>is particularly strong with respect to efforts to root out fraud. But&para;<br>the State’s interest is not limited to combating fraud; it extends to ef&para;<br>forts to ferret out invalid signatures caused not by fraud but by sim&para;<br>ple mistake, such as duplicate signatures or signatures of individuals&para;<br>who are not registered to vote in the State. The State’s interest also&para;<br>extends more generally to promoting transparency and accountability&para;<br>in the electoral process.&para;<br>Plaintiffs contend that disclosure is not sufficiently related to the&para;<br>interest of protecting the integrity of the electoral process to with&para;<br>stand First Amendment scrutiny. They argue that disclosure is not&para;<br>necessary because the secretary of state is already charged with veri&para;<br>fying and canvassing the names on a petition, a measure’s advocates&para;<br>and opponents can observe that process, any citizen can challenge the&para;<br>secretary’s actions in court, and criminal penalties reduce the danger&para;<br>of fraud in the petition process. But the secretary’s verification and&para;<br>canvassing will not catch all the invalid signatures, and public disclo&para;<br>sure can help cure the inadequacies of the secretary’s process. Dis&para;<br>closure also helps prevent difficult-to-detect fraud such as outright&para;<br>forgery and “bait and switch” fraud, in which an individual signs the&para;<br>petition based on a misrepresentation of the underlying issue. And&para;<br>disclosure promotes transparency and accountability in the electoral&para;<br>process to an extent other measures cannot. Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(d) Plaintiffs’ main objection is that “the strength of the govern&para;<br>mental interest” does not “reflect the seriousness of the actual burden&para;<br>on First Amendment rights.” Davis, supra, at ___. According to&para;<br>plaintiffs, the objective of those seeking disclosure is not to prevent&para;<br>fraud, but to publicly identify signatories and broadcast their politi&para;<br>cal views on the subject of the petition. Plaintiffs allege, for example,&para;<br>that several groups plan to post the petitions in searchable form on&para;<br>the Internet, and then encourage other citizens to seek out R–71 peti&para;<br>tion signers. That, plaintiffs argue, would subject them to threats,&para;<br>harassment, and reprisals.&para;<br>The problem for plaintiffs is that their argument rests almost en&para;<br>tirely on the specific harm that would attend the disclosure of infor&para;<br>mation on the R–71 petition. But the question before the Court at&para;<br>this stage of the litigation is whether disclosure of referendum peti&para;<br>tions in general violates the First Amendment. Faced with the&para;<br>State’s unrebutted arguments that only modest burdens attend the&para;<br>disclosure of a typical petition, plaintiffs’ broad challenge to the PRA&para;<br>must be rejected. But upholding the PRA against a broad-based chal&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>lenge does not foreclose success on plaintiffs’ narrower challenge in&para;<br>Count II, which is pending before the District Court.

Roughly four percent of Wash&para;<br>ington voters must sign a petition to place such a referen&para;<br>dum on the ballot. That petition, which by law must&para;<br>include the names and addresses of the signers, is then&para;<br>submitted to the government for verification and canvass&para;<br>ing, to ensure that only lawful signatures are counted.&para;<br>The Washington Public Records Act (PRA) authorizes&para;<br>private parties to obtain copies of government documents,&para;<br>and the State construes the PRA to cover submitted refer&para;<br>endum petitions.&para;<br>This case arises out of a state law extending certain&para;<br>benefits to same-sex couples, and a corresponding referen&para;<br>dum petition to put that law to a popular vote. Respon&para;<br>dent intervenors invoked the PRA to obtain copies of the&para;<br>petition, with the names and addresses of the signers.&para;<br>Certain petition signers and the petition sponsor objected,&para;<br>arguing that such public disclosure would violate their&para;<br>rights under the First Amendment.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The course of this litigation, however, has framed the&para;<br>legal question before us more broadly. The issue at this&para;<br>stage of the case is not whether disclosure of this particu&para;<br>lar petition would violate the First Amendment, but&para;<br>whether disclosure of referendum petitions in general&para;<br>would do so. We conclude that such disclosure does not as&para;<br>a general matter violate the First Amendment, and we&para;<br>therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. We&para;<br>leave it to the lower courts to consider in the first instance&para;<br>the signers’ more focused claim concerning disclosure of&para;<br>the information on this particular petition, which is pend&para;<br>ing before the District Court.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Washington Constitution reserves to the people the&para;<br>power to reject any bill, with a few limited exceptions not&para;<br>relevant here, through the referendum process. Wash.&para;<br>Const., Art. II, §1(b). To initiate a referendum, proponents&para;<br>must file a petition with the secretary of state that con&para;<br>tains valid signatures of registered Washington voters&para;<br>equal to or exceeding four percent of the votes cast for the&para;<br>office of Governor at the last gubernatorial election.&para;<br>§§1(b), (d). A valid submission requires not only a signa&para;<br>ture, but also the signer’s address and the county in which&para;<br>he is registered to vote. Wash. Rev. Code §29A.72.130&para;<br>(2008).&para;<br>In May 2009, Washington Governor Christine Gregoire&para;<br>signed into law Senate Bill 5688, which “expand[ed] the&para;<br>rights and responsibilities” of state-registered domestic&para;<br>partners, including same-sex domestic partners. 586 F. 3d&para;<br>671, 675 (CA9 2009). That same month, Protect Marriage&para;<br>Washington, one of the petitioners here, was organized as&para;<br>a “State Political Committee” for the purpose of collecting&para;<br>the petition signatures necessary to place a referendum on&para;<br>the ballot, which would give the voters themselves an&para;<br>opportunity to vote on SB 5688. App. 8–9. If the referen&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>dum made it onto the ballot, Protect Marriage Washington&para;<br>planned to encourage voters to reject SB 5688. Id., at 7, 9.&para;<br>On July 25, 2009, Protect Marriage Washington submit&para;<br>ted to the secretary of state a petition containing over&para;<br>137,000 signatures. See 586 F. 3d, at 675; Brief for Re&para;<br>spondent Washington Families Standing Together 6. The&para;<br>secretary of state then began the verification and canvass&para;<br>ing process, as required by Washington law, to ensure that&para;<br>only legal signatures were counted. Wash. Rev. Code&para;<br>§29A.72.230. Some 120,000 valid signatures were re&para;<br>quired to place the referendum on the ballot. Sam Reed,&para;<br>Washington Secretary of State, Certification of Referen&para;<br>dum 71 (Sept. 2, 2009). The secretary of state determined&para;<br>that the petition contained a sufficient number of valid&para;<br>signatures, and the referendum (R–71) appeared on the&para;<br>November 2009 ballot. The voters approved SB 5688 by a&para;<br>margin of 53% to 47%.&para;<br>The PRA, Wash. Rev. Code §42.56.001 et seq., makes all&para;<br>“public records” available for public inspection and copy&para;<br>ing. §42.56.070(1) (2008). The Act defines “[p]ublic re&para;<br>cord” as “any writing containing information relating to&para;<br>the conduct of government or the performance of any&para;<br>governmental or proprietary function prepared, owned,&para;<br>used, or retained by any state or local agency.”&para;<br>§42.56.010(2). Washington takes the position that refer&para;<br>endum petitions are “public records.” Brief for Respon&para;<br>dent Reed 5.&para;<br>By August 20, 2009, the secretary had received requests&para;<br>for copies of the R–71 petition from an individual and four&para;<br>entities, including Washington Coalition for Open Gov&para;<br>ernment (WCOG) and Washington Families Standing&para;<br>Together (WFST), two of the respondents here. 586 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 675.&para;<br>Two entities, WhoSigned.org and KnowThyNeighbor.org, issued a joint press release stating their&para;<br>intention to post the names of the R–71 petition signers&para;<br>online, in a searchable format. See App. 11; 586 F. 3d, at&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>675.&para;<br>The referendum petition sponsor and certain signers&para;<br>filed a complaint and a motion for a preliminary injunction&para;<br>in the United States District Court for the Western Dis&para;<br>trict of Washington, seeking to enjoin the secretary of&para;<br>state from publicly releasing any documents that would&para;<br>reveal the names and contact information of the R–71&para;<br>petition signers. App. 4. Count I of the complaint alleges&para;<br>that “[t]he Public Records Act is unconstitutional as ap&para;<br>plied to referendum petitions.” Id., at 16. Count II of the&para;<br>complaint alleges that “[t]he Public Records Act is uncon&para;<br>stitutional as applied to the Referendum 71 petition be&para;<br>cause there is a reasonable probability that the signatories&para;<br>of the Referendum 71 petition will be subjected to threats,&para;<br>harassment, and reprisals.” Id., at 17. Determining that&para;<br>the PRA burdened core political speech, the District Court&para;<br>held that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of&para;<br>Count I and granted them a preliminary injunction on&para;<br>that count, enjoining release of the information on the&para;<br>petition. 661 F. Supp. 2d 1194, 1205–1206 (WD Wash.&para;<br>2009).&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir&para;<br>cuit reversed. Reviewing only Count I of the complaint,&para;<br>the Court of Appeals held that plaintiffs were unlikely to&para;<br>succeed on their claim that the PRA is unconstitutional as&para;<br>applied to referendum petitions generally. It therefore&para;<br>reversed the District Court’s grant of the preliminary&para;<br>injunction. 586 F. 3d, at 681. We granted certiorari. 558&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>It is important at the outset to define the scope of the&para;<br>challenge before us. As noted, Count I of the complaint&para;<br>contends that the PRA “violates the First Amendment as&para;<br>applied to referendum petitions.” App. 16. Count II as&para;<br>serts that the PRA “is unconstitutional as applied to the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Referendum 71 petition.” Id., at 17. The District Court&para;<br>decision was based solely on Count I; the Court of Appeals&para;<br>decision reversing the District Court was similarly lim&para;<br>ited. 586 F. 3d, at 676, n. 6. Neither court addressed&para;<br>Count II.&para;<br>The parties disagree about whether Count I is properly&para;<br>viewed as a facial or as-applied challenge. Compare Reply&para;<br>Brief for Petitioners 8 (“Count I expressly made an as&para;<br>applied challenge”), with Brief for Respondent Reed 1&para;<br>(“This is a facial challenge to Washington’s Public Records&para;<br>Act”). It obviously has characteristics of both: The claim is&para;<br>“as applied” in the sense that it does not seek to strike the&para;<br>PRA in all its applications, but only to the extent it covers&para;<br>referendum petitions. The claim is “facial” in that it is not&para;<br>limited to plaintiffs’ particular case, but challenges appli&para;<br>cation of the law more broadly to all referendum petitions.&para;<br>The label is not what matters. The important point is&para;<br>that plaintiffs’ claim and the relief that would follow—an&para;<br>injunction barring the secretary of state “from making&para;<br>referendum petitions available to the public,” App. 16&para;<br>(Complaint Count I)—reach beyond the particular circum&para;<br>stances of these plaintiffs. They must therefore satisfy our&para;<br>standards for a facial challenge to the extent of that reach.&para;<br>See United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip&para;<br>op., at 10).&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The compelled disclosure of signatory information on&para;<br>referendum petitions is subject to review under the First&para;<br>Amendment. An individual expresses a view on a political&para;<br>matter when he signs a petition under Washington’s&para;<br>referendum procedure. In most cases, the individual’s&para;<br>signature will express the view that the law subject to the&para;<br>petition should be overturned. Even if the signer is agnos&para;<br>tic as to the merits of the underlying law, his signature&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>still expresses the political view that the question should&para;<br>be considered “by the whole electorate.” Meyer v. Grant,&para;<br>486 U. S. 414, 421 (1988). In either case, the expression of&para;<br>a political view implicates a First Amendment right. The&para;<br>State, having “cho[sen] to tap the energy and the legiti&para;<br>mizing power of the democratic process, . . . must accord&para;<br>the participants in that process the First Amendment&para;<br>rights that attach to their roles.” Republican Party of&para;<br>Minn. v. White, 536 U. S. 765, 788 (2002) (internal quota&para;<br>tion marks and ellipsis omitted).&para;<br>Respondents counter that signing a petition is a legally&para;<br>operative legislative act and therefore “does not involve&para;<br>any significant expressive element.” Brief for Respondent&para;<br>Reed 31. It is true that signing a referendum petition may&para;<br>ultimately have the legal consequence of requiring the&para;<br>secretary of state to place the referendum on the ballot.&para;<br>But we do not see how adding such legal effect to an ex&para;<br>pressive activity somehow deprives that activity of its&para;<br>expressive component, taking it outside the scope of the&para;<br>First Amendment. Respondents themselves implicitly&para;<br>recognize that the signature expresses a particular view&para;<br>point, arguing that one purpose served by disclosure is to&para;<br>allow the public to engage signers in a debate on the mer&para;<br>its of the underlying law. See, e.g., id., at 45; Brief for&para;<br>Respondent WCOG 49; Brief for Respondent WFST 58.&para;<br>Petition signing remains expressive even when it has&para;<br>legal effect in the electoral process. But that is not to say&para;<br>that the electoral context is irrelevant to the nature of our&para;<br>First Amendment review. We allow States significant&para;<br>flexibility in implementing their own voting systems. See&para;<br>Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 433–434 (1992). To the&para;<br>extent a regulation concerns the legal effect of a particular&para;<br>activity in that process, the government will be afforded&para;<br>substantial latitude to enforce that regulation. Also perti&para;<br>nent to our analysis is the fact that the PRA is not a pro&para;<br>hibition on speech, but instead a disclosure requirement.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“[D]isclosure requirements may burden the ability to&para;<br>speak, but they . . . do not prevent anyone from speaking.”&para;<br>Citizens United v.

REED &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondents assert two interests to justify the burdens&para;<br>of compelled disclosure under the PRA on First Amend&para;<br>ment rights: (1) preserving the integrity of the electoral&para;<br>process by combating fraud, detecting invalid signatures,&para;<br>and fostering government transparency and accountabil&para;<br>ity; and (2) providing information to the electorate about&para;<br>who supports the petition. See, e.g., Brief for Respondent&para;<br>Reed 39–42, 44–45. Because we determine that the&para;<br>State’s interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral&para;<br>process suffices to defeat the argument that the PRA is&para;<br>unconstitutional with respect to referendum petitions in&para;<br>general, we need not, and do not, address the State’s&para;<br>“informational” interest.&para;<br>The State’s interest in preserving the integrity of the&para;<br>electoral process is undoubtedly important. “States allow&para;<br>ing ballot initiatives have considerable leeway to protect&para;<br>the integrity and reliability of the initiative process, as&para;<br>they have with respect to election processes generally.”&para;<br>ACLF, 525 U. S., at 191. The State’s interest is particu&para;<br>larly strong with respect to efforts to root out fraud, which&para;<br>not only may produce fraudulent outcomes, but has a&para;<br>systemic effect as well: It “drives honest citizens out of the&para;<br>democratic process and breeds distrust of our govern&para;<br>ment.” Purcell v.

Because compelled disclo&para;<br>sure can “burden the ability to speak,” Citizens United,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 51), and “seriously infringe on&para;<br>privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First&para;<br>Amendment,” Buckley, supra, at 64, the as-applied exemp&para;<br>tion plays a critical role in safeguarding First Amendment&para;<br>rights.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The possibility of prevailing in an as-applied challenge&para;<br>provides adequate protection for First Amendment rights&para;<br>only if (1) speakers can obtain the exemption sufficiently&para;<br>far in advance to avoid chilling protected speech and (2)&para;<br>the showing necessary to obtain the exemption is not&para;<br>overly burdensome. With respect to the first requirement,&para;<br>the as-applied exemption becomes practically worthless if&para;<br>speakers cannot obtain the exemption quickly and well in&para;<br>advance of speaking. To avoid the possibility that a dis&para;<br>closure requirement might chill the willingness of voters&para;<br>to sign a referendum petition (and thus burden a circula&para;<br>tor’s ability to collect the necessary number of signatures,&para;<br>cf. Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 423 (1988)), voters must&para;<br>have some assurance at the time when they are presented&para;<br>with the petition that their names and identifying infor&para;<br>mation will not be released to the public. The only way a&para;<br>circulator can provide such assurance, however, is if the&para;<br>circulator has sought and obtained an as-applied exemp&para;<br>tion from the disclosure requirement well before circulat&para;<br>ing the petition. Otherwise, the best the circulator could&para;<br>do would be to tell voters that an exemption might be&para;<br>obtained at some point in the future. Such speculation&para;<br>would often be insufficient to alleviate voters’ concerns&para;<br>about the possibility of being subjected to threats, har&para;<br>assment, or reprisals. Cf.

We acknowledged as much in Buckley, where we&para;<br>noted that “unduly strict requirements of proof could&para;<br>impose a heavy burden” on speech. 424 U. S., at 74.&para;<br>Recognizing that speakers “must be allowed sufficient&para;<br>flexibility in the proof of injury to assure a fair considera&para;<br>tion of their claim,” we emphasized that speakers “need&para;<br>show only a reasonable probability” that disclosure will&para;<br>lead to threats, harassment, or reprisals. Ibid. (emphasis&para;<br>added). We stated that speakers could rely on a wide&para;<br>array of evidence to meet that standard, including “spe&para;<br>cific evidence of past or present harassment of [group]&para;<br>members,” “harassment directed against the organization&para;<br>itself,” or a “pattern of threats or specific manifestations of&para;<br>public hostility.” Ibid. Significantly, we also made clear&para;<br>that “[n]ew [groups] that have no history upon which to&para;<br>draw may be able to offer evidence of reprisals and threats&para;<br>directed against individuals or organizations holding&para;<br>similar views.” Ibid. From its inception, therefore, the as&para;<br>applied exemption has not imposed onerous burdens of&para;<br>proof on speakers who fear that disclosure might lead to&para;<br>harassment or intimidation.&para;<br>II&para;<br>In light of those principles, the plaintiffs in this case&para;<br>have a strong argument that the PRA violates the First&para;<br>Amendment as applied to the Referendum 71 petition.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Consider first the burdens on plaintiffs’ First Amend&para;<br>ment rights. The widespread harassment and intimida&para;<br>tion suffered by supporters of California’s Proposition 8&para;<br>provides strong support for an as-applied exemption in the&para;<br>present case.

REED&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>quirement can rely on “evidence of reprisals and threats&para;<br>directed against individuals or organizations holding&para;<br>similar views”). Proposition 8 amended the California&para;<br>Constitution to provide that “[o]nly marriage between a&para;<br>man and a woman is valid or recognized in California,”&para;<br>Cal. Const., Art.

See 661 F. Supp.&para;<br>2d 1194, 1205–1206 (WD Wash. 2009); Tr. of Oral Arg. 40–&para;<br>41. For example, plaintiffs allege that the campaign&para;<br>manager for one of the plaintiff groups received threaten&para;<br>ing e-mails and phone calls, and that the threats were so&para;<br>severe that the manager filed a complaint with the local&para;<br>sheriff and had his children sleep in an interior room of&para;<br>his home.

See Buckley, supra, at&para;<br>71 (recognizing that the weakness of the State’s interests&para;<br>in an individual case can require exempting speakers from&para;<br>compelled disclosure); Brown, 459 U. S., at 92–93 (same).&para;<br>As the Court notes, respondents rely on two interests to&para;<br>justify compelled disclosure in this context: (1) providing&para;<br>information to voters about who supports a referendum&para;<br>petition; and (2) preserving the integrity of the referen&para;<br>dum process by detecting fraudulent and mistaken signa&para;<br>tures. Ante, at 8.&para;<br>1&para;<br>In my view, respondents’ asserted informational interest&para;<br>will not in any case be sufficient to trump the First&para;<br>Amendment rights of signers and circulators who face a&para;<br>threat of harassment. Respondents maintain that publicly&para;<br>disclosing the names and addresses of referendum signa&para;<br>tories provides the voting public with “insight into&para;<br>whether support for holding a vote comes predominantly&para;<br>from particular interest groups, political or religious or&para;<br>ganizations, or other group[s] of citizens,” and thus allows&para;<br>voters to draw inferences about whether they should&para;<br>support or oppose the referendum. Brief for Respondent&para;<br>Washington Families Standing Together 58; see also Brief&para;<br>for Respondent Reed 46–48. Additionally, respondents&para;<br>argue that disclosure “allows Washington voters to engage&para;<br>in discussion of referred measures with persons whose&para;<br>acts secured the election and suspension of state law.” Id.,&para;<br>at 45; see also Brief for Respondent Washington Families&para;<br>Standing Together 58.&para;<br>The implications of accepting such an argument are&para;<br>breathtaking. Were we to accept respondents’ asserted&para;<br>informational interest, the State would be free to require&para;<br>petition signers to disclose all kinds of demographic infor&para;<br>mation, including the signer’s race, religion, political&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>affiliation, sexual orientation, ethnic background, and&para;<br>interest-group memberships. Requiring such disclosures,&para;<br>however, runs headfirst into a half century of our case&para;<br>law, which firmly establishes that individuals have a right&para;<br>to privacy of belief and association. See Rumsfeld v. Fo&para;<br>rum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U. S.&para;<br>47, 69 (2006); Brown, supra, at 91; Buckley, 424 U. S., at&para;<br>64; DeGregory v.

Patterson, 357 U. S. 449, 462 (1958). Indeed, the&para;<br>State’s informational interest paints such a chilling pic&para;<br>ture of the role of government in our lives that at oral&para;<br>argument the Washington attorney general balked when&para;<br>confronted with the logical implications of accepting such&para;<br>an argument, conceding that the State could not require&para;<br>petition signers to disclose their religion or ethnicity. Tr.&para;<br>of Oral Arg. 37, 56.&para;<br>Respondents’ informational interest is no more legiti&para;<br>mate when viewed as a means of providing the public with&para;<br>information needed to locate and contact supporters of a&para;<br>referendum. In the name of pursuing such an interest, the&para;<br>State would be free to require petition signers to disclose&para;<br>any information that would more easily enable members&para;<br>of the voting public to contact them and engage them in&para;<br>discussion, including telephone numbers, e-mail ad&para;<br>dresses, and Internet aliases. Once again, permitting the&para;<br>government to require speakers to disclose such informa&para;<br>tion runs against the current of our associational privacy&para;<br>cases. But more important, when speakers are faced with&para;<br>a reasonable probability of harassment or intimidation,&para;<br>the State no longer has any interest in enabling the public&para;<br>to locate and contact supporters of a particular measure—&para;<br>for in that instance, disclosure becomes a means of facili&para;<br>tating harassment that impermissibly chills the exercise&para;<br>of First Amendment rights.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Federal Election Comm’n, 554 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2008) (slip op., at 18).&para;<br>First, the realities of Washington law undermine the&para;<br>State’s argument that public disclosure is necessary to&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>ensure the integrity of the referendum process. The State&para;<br>of Washington first authorized voter initiatives via consti&para;<br>tutional amendment in 1912, and the following year the&para;<br>Washington Legislature passed a statute specifying the&para;<br>particulars of the referendum process. See State ex rel.&para;<br>Case v. Superior Ct. for Thurston Cty., 81 Wash. 623, 628,&para;<br>143 P. 461, 462 (1914). Significantly, Washington’s laws&para;<br>pertaining to initiatives and referenda did not then and do&para;<br>not now authorize the public disclosure of signatory in&para;<br>formation. See Wash. Rev. Code §29A.72.010 et seq.; 1913&para;<br>Wash. Laws. pp. 418–437. Instead, the public disclosure&para;<br>requirement stems from the PRA, which was enacted in&para;<br>1972 and which requires the public disclosure of state&para;<br>documents generally, not referendum documents specifi&para;<br>cally. See Wash. Rev. Code §42.56.001 et seq. Indeed, if&para;<br>anything, Washington’s referenda and initiative laws&para;<br>suggest that signatory information should remain confi&para;<br>dential: Outside observers are permitted to observe the&para;<br>secretary of state’s verification and canvassing process&para;<br>only “so long as they make no record of the names, ad&para;<br>dresses, or other information on the petitions or related&para;<br>records during the verification process,” §29A.72.230, and&para;<br>the State is required to destroy all those petitions that fail&para;<br>to qualify for the ballot, §29A.72.200.&para;<br>Second, the State fails to come to grips with the fact&para;<br>that public disclosure of referendum signatory information&para;<br>is a relatively recent practice in Washington. Prior to the&para;<br>adoption of the PRA in 1972, the Washington attorney&para;<br>general took the view that referendum petitions were not&para;<br>subject to public disclosure. See Op. Wash. Atty. Gen. 55–&para;<br>57 No. 274, pp. 1–2 (May 28, 1956), online at&para;<br>http://www.atg.wa.gov/AGOOpinions/opinion.aspx?section&para;<br>=topic&amp;id=10488 (all Internet materials as visited June&para;<br>17, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file) (de&para;<br>claring that public disclosure of initiative petitions would&para;<br>be “contrary to public policy” and would run contrary to “a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Indeed, the&para;<br>secretary of state represents on his Web site that even&para;<br>after the PRA was enacted, “various Secretary of State&para;<br>administrations took the position, from 1973 to 1998, that&para;<br>the personal information on petition sheets were NOT&para;<br>subject to disclosure.” B. Zylstra, The Disclosure History&para;<br>of Petition Sheets (Sept. 17, 2009), online at&para;<br>http://blogs.sos.wa.gov/FromOurCorner/index.php/2009/09/&para;<br>the-disclosure-history-of-petition-sheets/.&para;<br>Although the&para;<br>secretary of state apparently changed this policy in the&para;<br>late 1990’s, it appears that the secretary did not release&para;<br>any initiative petitions until 2006. Ibid. And to date, the&para;<br>secretary has released only a handful of petitions. Ibid.;&para;<br>App. 26. That history substantially undermines the&para;<br>State’s assertion that public disclosure is necessary to&para;<br>ensure the integrity of the referendum process. For nearly&para;<br>a century, Washington’s referendum process operated—&para;<br>and apparently operated successfully—without the public&para;<br>disclosure of signatory information. The State has failed&para;<br>to explain how circumstances have changed so dramati&para;<br>cally in recent years that public disclosure is now&para;<br>required.&para;<br>Third, the experiences of other States demonstrates that&para;<br>publicly disclosing the names and identifying information&para;<br>of referendum signatories is not necessary to protect&para;<br>against fraud and mistake. To give but one example,&para;<br>California has had more initiatives on the ballot than any&para;<br>other State save Oregon. See Initiative and Referendum&para;<br>Institute, Initiative Use, p. 1 (Feb. 2009), online at&para;<br>http://www.iandrinstitute.org/IRI%20Initiative%20Use%2&para;<br>0%281904=2008%29.pdf.&para;<br>Nonetheless, California law&para;<br>explicitly protects the privacy of initiative and referendum&para;<br>signatories. See Cal. Elec. Code Ann. §18650 (West 2003);&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §6253.5 (West 2008). It is thus&para;<br>entirely possible for a State to keep signatory information&para;<br>private and maintain a referendum and initiative process&para;<br>free from fraud.&para;<br>Finally, Washington could easily and cheaply employ&para;<br>alternative mechanisms for protecting against fraud and&para;<br>mistake that would be far more protective of circulators’&para;<br>and signers’ First Amendment rights. For example, the&para;<br>Washington attorney general represented to us at oral&para;<br>argument that “the Secretary of State’s first step after&para;<br>receiving submitted petitions is to take them to his archiv&para;<br>ing section and to have them digitized.” Tr. of Oral Arg.&para;<br>30. With a digitized list, it should be relatively easy for&para;<br>the secretary to check for duplicate signatures on a refer&para;<br>endum petition. And given that the secretary maintains a&para;<br>“centralized, uniform, interactive computerized statewide&para;<br>voter registration list that contains the name and registra&para;<br>tion information of every registered voter in the state,”&para;<br>Wash. Rev. Code Ann. §29A.08.125(1) (West Supp. 2010),&para;<br>the secretary could use a computer program to cross-check&para;<br>the names and addresses on the petition with the names&para;<br>and addresses on the voter registration roles, thus ensur&para;<br>ing the accuracy and legitimacy of each signature.&para;<br>Additionally, using the digitized version of the referen&para;<br>dum petition, the State could set up a simple system for&para;<br>Washington citizens to check whether their names have&para;<br>been fraudulently signed to a petition. For example, on&para;<br>his Web site, the secretary maintains an interface that&para;<br>allows voters to confirm their voter registration informa&para;<br>tion simply by inputting their name and date of birth. See&para;<br>http://wei.secstate.wa.gov/osos/VoterVault/Pages/MyVote.a&para;<br>spx. Presumably the secretary could set up a similar&para;<br>interface for referendum petitions. Indeed, the process&para;<br>would seem to be all the more simple given that Washing&para;<br>ton requires a “unique identifier [to] be assigned to each&para;<br>registered voter in the state.” §29A.08.125(4).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

These mechanisms of direct democracy are&para;<br>not compelled by the Federal Constitution. It is instead&para;<br>up to the people of each State, acting in their sovereign&para;<br>capacity, to decide whether and how to permit legislation&para;<br>by popular action. States enjoy “considerable leeway” to&para;<br>choose the subjects that are eligible for placement on the&para;<br>ballot and to specify the requirements for obtaining ballot&para;<br>access (e.g., the number of signatures required, the time&para;<br>for submission, and the method of verification). Buckley v.&para;<br>American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc., 525 U. S.&para;<br>182, 191 (1999). As the Court properly recognizes, each of&para;<br>these structural decisions “inevitably affects—at least to&para;<br>some degree—the individual’s right” to speak about politi&para;<br>cal issues and “to associate with others for political ends.”&para;<br>Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788 (1983). For&para;<br>instance, requiring petition signers to be registered voters&para;<br>or to use their real names no doubt limits the ability or&para;<br>willingness of some individuals to undertake the expres&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>sive act of signing a petition. Regulations of this nature,&para;<br>however, stand “a step removed from the communicative&para;<br>aspect of petitioning,” and the ability of States to impose&para;<br>them can scarcely be doubted.

It is by no means necessary for a&para;<br>State to prove that such “reasonable, nondiscriminatory&para;<br>restrictions” are narrowly tailored to its interests. Ander&para;<br>son, 460 U.

Cf. Buckley, 525&para;<br>U. S., at 200 (describing a state law requiring petition&para;<br>circulators to submit affidavits containing their names&para;<br>and addresses as “exemplif[ying] the type of regulation”&para;<br>that States may adopt). Public disclosure of the identity of&para;<br>petition signers, which is the rule in the overwhelming&para;<br>majority of States that use initiatives and referenda,&para;<br>advances States’ vital interests in “[p]reserving the integ&para;<br>rity of the electoral process, preventing corruption, and&para;<br>sustaining the active, alert responsibility of the individual&para;<br>citizen in a democracy for the wise conduct of govern&para;<br>ment.” First Nat.

As this Court has observed with&para;<br>respect to campaign-finance regulations, “disclosure re&para;<br>quirements . . . ‘do not prevent anyone from speaking.’ ”&para;<br>Citizens United, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 51). When it&para;<br>comes to initiatives and referenda, the impact of public&para;<br>disclosure on expressive interests is even more attenuated.&para;<br>While campaign-finance disclosure injects the government&para;<br>into what would otherwise have been private political&para;<br>activity, the process of legislating by referendum is inher&para;<br>ently public. To qualify a referendum for the ballot, citi&para;<br>zens are required to sign a petition and supply identifying&para;<br>information to the State. The act of signing typically&para;<br>occurs in public, and the circulators who collect and sub&para;<br>mit signatures ordinarily owe signers no guarantee of&para;<br>confidentiality. For persons with the “civic courage” to&para;<br>participate in this process, post, at 10 (opinion of SCALIA,&para;<br>J.), the State’s decision to make accessible what they&para;<br>voluntarily place in the public sphere should not deter&para;<br>them from engaging in the expressive act of petition sign&para;<br>ing. Disclosure of the identity of petition signers, more&para;<br>over, in no way directly impairs the ability of anyone to&para;<br>speak and associate for political ends either publicly or&para;<br>privately.&para;<br>Given the relative weight of the interests at stake and&para;<br>the traditionally public nature of initiative and referen&para;<br>dum processes, the Court rightly rejects petitioners’ con&para;<br>stitutional challenge to the State of Washington’s petition&para;<br>disclosure regulations. These same considerations also&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>mean that any party attempting to challenge particular&para;<br>applications of the State’s regulations will bear a heavy&para;<br>burden. Even when a referendum involves a particularly&para;<br>controversial subject and some petition signers fear har&para;<br>assment from nonstate actors, a State’s important inter&para;<br>ests in “protect[ing] the integrity and reliability of the&para;<br>initiative process” remain undiminished, and the State&para;<br>retains significant discretion in advancing those interests.&para;<br>Buckley, 525 U. S., at 191. Likewise, because the expres&para;<br>sive interests implicated by the act of petition signing are&para;<br>always modest, I find it difficult to see how any incre&para;<br>mental disincentive to sign a petition would tip the consti&para;<br>tutional balance. Case-specific relief may be available&para;<br>when a State selectively applies a facially neutral petition&para;<br>disclosure rule in a manner that discriminates based on&para;<br>the content of referenda or the viewpoint of petition sign&para;<br>ers, or in the rare circumstance in which disclosure poses&para;<br>a reasonable probability of serious and widespread har&para;<br>assment that the State is unwilling or unable to control.&para;<br>Cf. NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449&para;<br>(1958). Allowing case-specific invalidation under a more&para;<br>forgiving standard would unduly diminish the substantial&para;<br>breathing room States are afforded to adopt and imple&para;<br>ment reasonable, nondiscriminatory measures like the&para;<br>disclosure requirement now at issue. Accordingly, courts&para;<br>presented with an as-applied challenge to a regulation&para;<br>authorizing the disclosure of referendum petitions should&para;<br>be deeply skeptical of any assertion that the Constitution,&para;<br>which embraces political transparency, compels States to&para;<br>conceal the identity of persons who seek to participate in&para;<br>lawmaking through a state-created referendum process.&para;<br>With this understanding, I join the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

It is not about a restriction on&para;<br>voting or on speech and does not involve a classic disclo&para;<br>sure requirement. Rather, the case concerns a neutral,&para;<br>nondiscriminatory policy of disclosing information already&para;<br>in the State’s possession that, it has been alleged, might&para;<br>one day indirectly burden petition signatories. The bur&para;<br>den imposed by Washington’s application of the Public&para;<br>Records Act (PRA) to referendum petitions in the vast&para;<br>majority, if not all, its applications is not substantial. And&para;<br>the State has given a more than adequate justification for&para;<br>its choice.&para;<br>For a number of reasons, the application of the PRA to&para;<br>referendum petitions does not substantially burden any&para;<br>individual’s expression. First, it is not “a regulation of&para;<br>pure speech.” McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514&para;<br>U. S. 334, 345 (1995); cf. United States v. O’Brien, 391&para;<br>U. S. 367, 377 (1968). It does not prohibit expression, nor&para;<br>does it require that any person signing a petition disclose&para;<br>or say anything at all. See McIntyre, 514 U. S. 334. Nor&para;<br>does the State’s disclosure alter the content of a speaker’s&para;<br>message. See id., at 342–343.&para;<br>Second, any effect on speech that disclosure might have&para;<br>is minimal. The PRA does not necessarily make it more&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>difficult to circulate or obtain signatures on a petition, see&para;<br>Buckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc.,&para;<br>525 U. S. 182, 193–196 (1999); Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S.&para;<br>414, 422–423 (1988), or to communicate one’s views gen&para;<br>erally. Regardless of whether someone signs a referendum&para;<br>petition, that person remains free to say anything to any&para;<br>one at any time. If disclosure indirectly burdens a&para;<br>speaker, “the amount of speech covered” is small—only a&para;<br>single, narrow message conveying one fact in one place,&para;<br>Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v. Village of&para;<br>Stratton, 536 U. S. 150, 165 (2002); cf. Cox v. New Hamp&para;<br>shire, 312 U. S. 569 (1941). And while the democratic act&para;<br>of casting a ballot or signing a petition does serve an&para;<br>expressive purpose, the act does not involve any “interac&para;<br>tive communication,” Meyer, 486 U. S., at 422, and is “not&para;<br>principally” a method of “individual expression of political&para;<br>sentiment,” Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520&para;<br>U. S. 351, 373 (1997) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); cf. O’Brien,&para;<br>391 U. S., at 377.1&para;<br>Weighed against the possible burden on constitutional&para;<br>rights are the State’s justifications for its rule. In this&para;<br>case, the State has posited a perfectly adequate justifica&para;<br>tion: an interest in deterring and detecting petition fraud.2&para;<br>Given the pedigree of this interest and of similar regula&para;<br>tions, the State need not produce concrete evidence that&para;<br>the PRA is the best way to prevent fraud. See Crawford v.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Although&para;<br>&para;<br>a “petition” is a classic means of political expression, the&para;<br>type of petition at issue in this case is not merely a document on which&para;<br>people are expressing their views but rather is a state-created forum with&para;<br>a particular function: sorting those issues that have enough public&para;<br>support to warrant limited space on a referendum ballot. Cf. Widmar v.&para;<br>Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 278 (1981) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).&para;<br>2 Washington also points out that its disclosure policy informs voters&para;<br>about who supports the particular referendum. In certain election-law&para;<br>contexts, this informational rationale (among others) may provide a&para;<br>basis for regulation; in this case, there is no need to look beyond the&para;<br>State’s quite obvious antifraud interest.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

See, e.g., post, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment). But our&para;<br>decision in McIntyre posited no such freewheeling right.

That freedom can be burdened by a law that exposes&para;<br>the speaker to fines, as much as it can be burdened by a law that&para;<br>exposes a speaker to harassment, changes the content of his speech, or&para;<br>prejudices others against his message. See id., at 342. The right,&para;<br>however, is the right to speak, not the right to speak without being&para;<br>fined or the right to speak anonymously.&para;<br>5 A rare case may also arise in which the level of threat to any indi&para;<br>vidual is not quite so high but a State’s disclosure would substantially&para;<br>limit a group’s ability to “garner the number of signatures necessary to&para;<br>place [a] matter on the ballot,” thereby “limiting [its] ability to make&para;<br>the matter the focus of statewide discussion.” Meyer v.

In my view this is not a matter for judicial interest&para;<br>balancing. Our Nation’s longstanding traditions of legis&para;<br>lating and voting in public refute the claim that the First&para;<br>Amendment accords a right to anonymity in the perform&para;<br>ance of an act with governmental effect. “A governmental&para;<br>practice that has become general throughout the United&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Plaintiffs seem to disavow reliance on McIntyre v.

But McIntyre used the same shorthand. See 514&para;<br>U. S., at 357 (“[t]he right to remain anonymous”); id., at 342 (“[t]he&para;<br>freedom to publish anonymously”); see also ibid.

The Wash&para;<br>ington Constitution vests “[t]he legislative authority” of&para;<br>the State in the legislature, but “the people reserve to&para;<br>themselves the power . . . to approve or reject at the polls&para;<br>any act, item, section, or part of any bill, act, or law passed&para;<br>by the legislature.” Art. 2, §1. This “referendum” power of&para;<br>popular legislation is exercised by submitting a petition, in&para;<br>accordance with certain specifications, to the Washington&para;<br>secretary of state with valid signatures of registered vot&para;<br>ers in number equal to or exceeding four percent of the&para;<br>votes cast in the last gubernatorial election. §1(b); Wash.&para;<br>Rev. Code §29A.72.100, 130, 140, 150, 160 (2008).&para;<br>The filing of a referendum petition that satisfies these&para;<br>requirements has two legal effects: (1) It requires the&para;<br>secretary to place the measure referred to the people on&para;<br>the ballot at the next general election; and (2) it suspends&para;<br>operation of the measure, causing it only to have effect 30&para;<br>days after it is approved during that election. Art. 2,&para;<br>§1(d). See Brief for Respondent Sam Reed, Secretary of&para;<br>State of Washington 2–6. A voter who signs a referendum&para;<br>petition is therefore exercising legislative power because&para;<br>his signature, somewhat like a vote for or against a bill in&para;<br>the legislature, seeks to affect the legal force of the meas&para;<br>ure at issue.2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The Court notes that “only some petition signing has legal effect.”&para;<br>Ante, at 8, n. 1. That is true. Some petitions may never be submitted&para;<br>to the secretary; they are irrelevant here, since they will never be&para;<br>subject to the PRA. But some petitions that are submitted to the&para;<br>secretary may lack the requisite number of signatures. Even as to&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>Plaintiffs point to no precedent from this Court holding&para;<br>that legislating is protected by the First Amendment.3&para;<br>Nor do they identify historical evidence demonstrating&para;<br>that “the freedom of speech” the First Amendment codified&para;<br>encompassed a right to legislate without public disclosure.&para;<br>This should come as no surprise; the exercise of lawmak&para;<br>ing power in the United States has traditionally been&para;<br>public.&para;<br>The public nature of federal lawmaking is constitution&para;<br>ally required. Article I, §5, cl. 3 requires Congress to&para;<br>legislate in public: “Each House shall keep a Journal of its&para;<br>Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same,&para;<br>excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require&para;<br>Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either&para;<br>House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of&para;<br>those Present, be entered on the Journal.”4 State constitu&para;<br>——————&para;<br>those, the petition signer has exercised his portion of the legislative&para;<br>power when he signs the petition, much like a legislator who casts a&para;<br>losing vote.&para;<br>3 The Court quotes Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U. S. 765,&para;<br>788 (2002), which stated that a State “having ‘cho[sen] to tap the&para;<br>energy and the legitimizing power of the democratic process, . . . must&para;<br>accord the participants in that process the First Amendment rights&para;<br>that attach to their roles.’ ” Ante, at 6. That is correct, but it is not on&para;<br>point. White involved a prohibition on speaking as a condition of&para;<br>running for judicial office. I do not suggest that a State could require&para;<br>legislators (or the citizen-legislators who participate in a referendum)&para;<br>to give up First Amendment rights unconnected with their act of&para;<br>legislating. The electioneering disclosure cases the Court cites, ante, at&para;<br>7, are likewise not on point, since they involve disclosure requirements&para;<br>applied to political speech, not legislative action.&para;<br>4 The exception for “such Parts as may in their Judgment require&para;<br>Secrecy” was assuredly not designed to permit anonymous voting. It&para;<br>refers to details whose disclosure would threaten an important national&para;<br>interest. The similar clause in the Articles of Confederation created an&para;<br>exception to the journal requirement for parts of the proceedings&para;<br>“relating to treaties, alliances or military operations, as in [Congress’s]&para;<br>judgment require secresy.” Art. IX. The Constitution’s requirement is&para;<br>broader, but its object is obviously the same.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>tions enacted around the time of the founding had similar&para;<br>provisions. See, e.g., Ky. Const., Art. I, §20 (1792); Ga.&para;<br>Const., Art. I, §15 (1798). The desirability of public ac&para;<br>countability was obvious. “[A]s to the votes of representa&para;<br>tives and senators in Congress, no man has yet been bold&para;<br>enough to vindicate a secret or ballot vote, as either more&para;<br>safe or more wise, more promotive of independence in the&para;<br>members, or more beneficial to their constituents.” 1 J.&para;<br>Story, Commentaries on the Constitution §841, p. 591&para;<br>(4th ed. 1873).&para;<br>Moreover, even when the people asked Congress for&para;<br>legislative changes—by exercising their constitutional&para;<br>right “to petition the Government for a redress of griev&para;<br>ances,” U. S. Const., Amdt. 1—they did so publicly. The&para;<br>petition was read aloud in Congress. Mazzone, Freedom’s&para;<br>Associations, 77 Wash. L. Rev. 639, 726 (2002). The peti&para;<br>tioner’s name (when large groups were not involved), his&para;<br>request, and what action Congress had taken on the peti&para;<br>tion were consistently recorded in the House and Senate&para;<br>Journals. See, e.g., Journal of the Senate, June 18, 1790,&para;<br>1st Cong., 1st Sess., 163; Journal of the House of Repre&para;<br>sentatives, Nov. 24, 1820, 16th Cong., 2d Sess., 32. Even&para;<br>when the people exercised legislative power directly, they&para;<br>did so not anonymously, but openly in town hall meetings.&para;<br>See generally J. Zimmerman, The New England Town&para;<br>Meeting (1999).&para;<br>Petitioning the government and participating in the&para;<br>traditional town meeting were precursors of the modern&para;<br>initiative and referendum. Those innovations were mod&para;<br>eled after similar devices used by the Swiss democracy in&para;<br>the 1800’s, and were first used in the United States by&para;<br>South Dakota in 1898. See S. Piott, Giving Voters a Voice&para;<br>1–3, 16 (2003). The most influential advocate of the initia&para;<br>tive and referendum in the United States analogized the&para;<br>Swiss practice to the town meeting, because both “re&para;<br>quired open conduct of political affairs and free expression&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>of opinions.” Id., at 5 (discussing J. W. Sullivan, Direct&para;<br>Legislation by the Citizenship through the Initiative and&para;<br>Referendum (1892)). Plaintiffs’ argument implies that the&para;<br>public nature of these practices, so longstanding and&para;<br>unquestioned, violated the freedom of speech. There is no&para;<br>historical support for such a claim.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Legislating was not the only governmental act that was&para;<br>public in America. Voting was public until 1888 when the&para;<br>States began to adopt the Australian secret ballot. See&para;<br>Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 203 (1992) (plurality&para;<br>opinion). We have acknowledged the existence of a First&para;<br>Amendment interest in voting, see, e.g., Burdick v. Taku&para;<br>shi, 504 U. S. 428 (1992), but we have never said that it&para;<br>includes the right to vote anonymously. The history of&para;<br>voting in the United States completely undermines that&para;<br>claim.&para;<br>Initially, the Colonies mostly continued the English&para;<br>traditions of voting by a show of hands or by voice—viva&para;<br>voce voting. Burson, supra, at 200; E. Evans, A History of&para;<br>the Australian Ballot System in the United States 1–6&para;<br>(1917) (Evans). One scholar described the viva voce sys&para;<br>tem as follows:&para;<br>“ ‘The election judges, who were magistrates, sat upon&para;<br>a bench with their clerks before them. Where practi&para;<br>cable, it was customary for the candidates to be pre&para;<br>sent in person, and to occupy a seat at the side of the&para;<br>judges. As the voter appeared, his name was called&para;<br>out in a loud voice. The judges inquired, “John Jones&para;<br>(or Smith), for whom do you vote?”—for governor, or&para;<br>whatever was the office to be filled. He replied by&para;<br>proclaiming the name of his favorite. Then the clerks&para;<br>enrolled the vote, and the judges announced it as en&para;<br>rolled. The representative of the candidate for whom&para;<br>he voted arose, bowed, and thanked him aloud; and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>his partisans often applauded.’ ” Id., at 5 (quoting&para;<br>J. Wise, The End of An Era 55–56 (1899)).&para;<br>See also R. Dinkin, A Study of Elections in the Original&para;<br>Thirteen States, 1776–1789, p. 101 (1982) (Dinkin).&para;<br>Although there was variation, the election official would&para;<br>ordinarily compile a poll with the name and residence of&para;<br>each voter, and the name of the candidate for whom he&para;<br>voted. See C. Bishop, History of Elections in the American&para;<br>Colonies 160–64 (1893) (Bishop); P. Argersinger, Struc&para;<br>ture, Process, and Party: Essays in American Political&para;<br>History 47 (1992) (Argersinger). To prevent fraud, the&para;<br>Colonies in Rhode Island, New York, and New Jersey&para;<br>adopted the English rule that “copies of the poll must be&para;<br>delivered on demand to persons who were willing to pay a&para;<br>reasonable charge for the labor of writing them.” Bishop&para;<br>186. Some colonies allowed candidates to demand a copy&para;<br>of the poll, ibid., and required the legislature to examine&para;<br>the poll in a contested election, id., at 188–189. Thus, as&para;<br>in this case, the government not only publicly collected&para;<br>identifying information about who voted and for which&para;<br>candidate, it also disclosed that information to the public.&para;<br>Any suggestion that viva voce voting infringed the ac&para;<br>cepted understanding of the pre-existing freedom of&para;<br>speech to which the First Amendment’s text refers is&para;<br>refuted by the fact that several state constitutions that&para;<br>required or authorized viva voce voting also explicitly&para;<br>guaranteed the freedom of speech. See, e.g., Ky. Const.,&para;<br>Art. X, §7, Art. VI, §16 (1799); Ill. Const., Art. VIII, §22,&para;<br>Art. I, §28 (1818). Surely one constitutional provision did&para;<br>not render the other invalid.&para;<br>Of course the practice of viva voce voting was gradually&para;<br>replaced with the paper ballot, which was thought to&para;<br>reduce fraud and undue influence. See Evans 1–6; Dinkin&para;<br>101–106. There is no indication that the shift resulted&para;<br>from a sudden realization that public voting infringed&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>voters’ freedom of speech, and the manner in which it&para;<br>occurred suggests the contrary. States adopted the paper&para;<br>ballot at different times, and some States changed meth&para;<br>ods multiple times. New York’s 1777 Constitution, for&para;<br>example, explicitly provided for the State to switch be&para;<br>tween methods. Art. VI. Kentucky’s 1792 Constitution&para;<br>required paper ballots, Art. III, §2, but its 1799 Constitu&para;<br>tion required viva voce voting, Art. VI, §16. The different&para;<br>voting methods simply reflected different views about how&para;<br>democracy should function. One scholar described Vir&para;<br>ginia’s and Kentucky’s steadfast use of viva voce voting&para;<br>through the Civil War as follows: “[I]n the appeal to un&para;<br>flinching manliness at the polls these two states insisted&para;<br>still that every voter should show at the hustings the&para;<br>courage of his personal conviction.” Schouler, Evolution of&para;<br>the American Voter, 2 The American Historical Review&para;<br>665, 671 (1897). See also id., at 666–667 (“In Virginia and&para;<br>the other states in close affiliation with her this oral ex&para;<br>pression was vaunted as the privilege of the free-born&para;<br>voter, to show the faith that was in him by an outspoken&para;<br>announcement of his candidate”).&para;<br>The new paper ballots did not make voting anonymous.&para;<br>See Evans 10 (“[T]he ballot was not secret”); Argersinger&para;<br>48 (“Certainly there were no legal provisions to ensure&para;<br>secrecy”). Initially, many States did not regulate the form&para;<br>of the paper ballot. See Evans 10; Argersinger 48–49.&para;<br>Taking advantage of this, political parties began printing&para;<br>ballots with their candidates’ names on them. They used&para;<br>brightly colored paper and other distinctive markings so&para;<br>that the ballots could be recognized from a distance, mak&para;<br>ing the votes public. See Burson, supra, at 200–201;&para;<br>Evans 10–11. Abuse of these unofficial paper ballots was&para;<br>rampant. The polling place had become an “open auction&para;<br>place” where votes could be freely bought or coerced.&para;<br>Burson, supra, at 202. Employers threatened employees.&para;<br>Party workers kept voters from the other party away from&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Ballot peddlers paid voters and then&para;<br>watched them place the ballot in the box. See L. Fredman,&para;<br>The Australian Ballot: The Story of an American Reform&para;<br>22–29 (1968); Argersinger 48–50. Thus, although some&para;<br>state courts said that voting by ballot was meant to be&para;<br>more secret than the public act of viva voce voting; and&para;<br>although some state constitutional requirements of ballot&para;<br>voting were held to guarantee ballot secrecy, thus prohib&para;<br>iting the numbering of ballots for voter identification&para;<br>purposes, see Williams v. Stein, 38 Ind. 89 (1871); Brisbin&para;<br>v. Cleary, 26 Minn. 107, 1 N. W. 825 (1879); in general,&para;<br>voting by ballot was by no means secret. Most important&para;<br>of all for present purposes, I am aware of no assertion of&para;<br>ballot secrecy that relied on federal or state constitutional&para;<br>guarantees of freedom of speech.&para;<br>It was precisely discontent over the nonsecret nature of&para;<br>ballot voting, and the abuses that produced, which led to&para;<br>the States’ adoption of the Australian secret ballot. New&para;<br>York and Massachusetts began that movement in 1888,&para;<br>and almost 90 percent of the States had followed suit by&para;<br>1896. Burson, 504 U. S., at 203–205. But I am aware of&para;<br>no contention that the Australian system was required by&para;<br>the First Amendment (or the state counterparts). That&para;<br>would have been utterly implausible, since the inhabitants&para;<br>of the Colonies, the States, and the United States had&para;<br>found public voting entirely compatible with “the freedom&para;<br>of speech” for several centuries.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The long history of public legislating and voting contra&para;<br>dicts plaintiffs’ claim that disclosure of petition signatures&para;<br>having legislative effect violates the First Amendment. As&para;<br>I said in McIntyre, “[w]here the meaning of a constitu&para;<br>tional text (such as ‘the freedom of speech’) is unclear, the&para;<br>widespread and long-accepted practices of the American&para;<br>people are the best indication of what fundamental beliefs&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>it was intended to enshrine.” 514 U. S., at 378 (dissenting&para;<br>opinion). Just as the century-old practice of States’ pro&para;<br>hibiting anonymous electioneering was sufficient for me to&para;<br>reject the First Amendment claim to anonymity in McIn&para;<br>tyre, the many-centuries-old practices of public legislating&para;<br>and voting are sufficient for me to reject plaintiffs’ claim.&para;<br>Plaintiffs raise concerns that the disclosure of petition&para;<br>signatures may lead to threats and intimidation. Of&para;<br>course nothing prevents the people of Washington from&para;<br>keeping petition signatures secret to avoid that—just as&para;<br>nothing prevented the States from moving to the secret&para;<br>ballot. But there is no constitutional basis for this Court&para;<br>to impose that course upon the States—or to insist (as&para;<br>today’s opinion does) that it can only be avoided by the&para;<br>demonstration of a “sufficiently important governmental&para;<br>interest,” ante, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>And it may even be a bad idea to keep petition signatures&para;<br>secret. There are laws against threats and intimidation;&para;<br>and harsh criticism, short of unlawful action, is a price our&para;<br>people have traditionally been willing to pay for self&para;<br>governance. Requiring people to stand up in public for&para;<br>their political acts fosters civic courage, without which&para;<br>democracy is doomed. For my part, I do not look forward&para;<br>to a society which, thanks to the Supreme Court, cam&para;<br>paigns anonymously (McIntyre) and even exercises the&para;<br>direct democracy of initiative and referendum hidden from&para;<br>public scrutiny and protected from the accountability of&para;<br>criticism.

Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1, 4 (2006)&para;<br>(per curiam), so too is citizen participation in those proc&para;<br>esses, which necessarily entails political speech and asso&para;<br>ciation under the First Amendment. In my view, com&para;<br>pelled disclosure of signed referendum and initiative&para;<br>petitions1 under the Washington Public Records Act&para;<br>(PRA), Wash. Rev. Code §42.56.001, et seq. (2008), severely&para;<br>burdens those rights and chills citizen participation in the&para;<br>referendum process. Given those burdens, I would hold&para;<br>that Washington’s decision to subject all referendum&para;<br>petitions to public disclosure is unconstitutional because&para;<br>there will always be a less restrictive means by which&para;<br>Washington can vindicate its stated interest in preserving&para;<br>the integrity of its referendum process. I respectfully&para;<br>dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Generally speaking, in a referendum, voters approve or reject an Act&para;<br>already passed by the legislature. In an initiative, voters adopt or&para;<br>reject an entirely new law, either a statute or a constitutional amend&para;<br>ment. See T. Cronin, Direct Democracy: The Politics of Initiative,&para;<br>Referendum, and Recall 2 (1989).&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>This case concerns the interaction of two distinct sets of&para;<br>Washington statutes. The first set, codified in Washing&para;<br>ton’s Election Code, regulates the referendum and initia&para;<br>tive process. These statutes require, among other things,&para;<br>that referendum signers write their names and addresses&para;<br>on petition sheets, and mandate that this information&para;<br>be disclosed to Washington’s secretary of state for canvass&para;<br>ing and verification. See, e.g., §§29A.72.130, 29A.72.230&para;<br>(2008). Petitioners do not contend that these require&para;<br>ments violate their First Amendment rights; that is, they&para;<br>do not argue that the Constitution allows them to support&para;<br>a referendum measure without disclosing their names to&para;<br>the State.&para;<br>The second set of statutes—the PRA—is not a referen&para;<br>dum or election regulation. Rather, the PRA requires&para;<br>disclosure of all nonexempt “public records” upon request&para;<br>by any person. See §§42.56.010(2), 42.56.070. Washing&para;<br>ton has concluded that signed referendum petitions are&para;<br>“public records” subject to disclosure under the PRA, and&para;<br>has “routinely disclosed petitions in response to public&para;<br>records requests.” Brief for Respondent Reed 5–6.&para;<br>Petitioners do not challenge the constitutionality of the&para;<br>PRA generally. They contend only that Washington vio&para;<br>lates their First Amendment rights by construing the PRA&para;<br>to apply to signed referendum petitions. See Brief for&para;<br>Petitioners 35–39. As the Court notes, the parties dispute&para;<br>whether this challenge is best conceived as a facial chal&para;<br>lenge or an as-applied challenge. See ante, at 5. In my&para;<br>view, the Court correctly concludes that petitioners must&para;<br>“satisfy our standards for a facial challenge” because their&para;<br>claim, and the relief that they seek, “reach beyond” their&para;<br>“particular circumstances.” Ibid.&para;<br>We typically disfavor facial challenges. See Washington&para;<br>State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552&para;<br>U. S. 442, 449 (2008). They “often rest on speculation,”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>can lead courts unnecessarily to anticipate constitutional&para;<br>questions or formulate broad constitutional rules, and may&para;<br>prevent governmental officers from implementing laws “in&para;<br>a manner consistent with the Constitution.” Id., at 450–&para;<br>451. For those reasons, we rejected in Washington State&para;<br>Grange political parties’ pre-enforcement facial challenge&para;<br>to a Washington initiative that allowed candidates in a&para;<br>primary election to self-designate their political party&para;<br>preference on the primary election ballot. See id., at 458–&para;<br>459. Because the challenge was a pre-enforcement one,&para;<br>Washington “had no opportunity to implement” the initia&para;<br>tive, id., at 450, so the political parties’ arguments that it&para;<br>violated their association rights all depended “on the&para;<br>possibility that voters will be confused as to the meaning&para;<br>of the party-preference designation,” id., at 454. More&para;<br>over, a facial challenge was inappropriate because the&para;<br>regulation did “not on its face impose a severe burden on&para;<br>political parties’ associational rights.” Id., at 444.&para;<br>Those considerations point in the opposite direction&para;<br>here. Washington’s construction of the PRA “on its face&para;<br>impose[s] a severe burden,” ibid.—compelled disclosure of&para;<br>privacy in political association protected by the First&para;<br>Amendment, see infra, at 4–5—on all referendum signers.&para;<br>And Washington has had several “opportunit[ies] to im&para;<br>plement” the PRA’s disclosure requirements with respect&para;<br>to initiative petitions. Washington State Grange, supra, at&para;<br>450. Indeed, Washington admits that “[a]ll petitions for&para;<br>initiatives, referendum, recall, and candidate nomination&para;<br>are public records subject to disclosure.” Brief for Respon&para;<br>dent Reed 59; see also App. 26 (listing six completed re&para;<br>quests for disclosure of signed initiative petitions since&para;<br>2006). Washington thus has eliminated any “possibility”&para;<br>that referendum petition signers “will be confused as to”&para;<br>how the State will respond to a request under the PRA to&para;<br>disclose their names and addresses. Washington State&para;<br>Grange, 552 U. S., at 454.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Accordingly, I would consider petitioners’ facial chal&para;<br>lenge here. For purposes of this case, I will assume that to&para;<br>prevail, petitioners must satisfy our most rigorous stan&para;<br>dard, and show that there is “ ‘no set of circumstances . . .&para;<br>under which the’ ” PRA could be constitutionally applied to&para;<br>a referendum or initiative petition, “i.e., that the [PRA] is&para;<br>unconstitutional in all of its applications,” id., at 449&para;<br>(quoting United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745&para;<br>(1987)).&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Court correctly concludes that “an individual ex&para;<br>presses” a “political view” by signing a referendum peti&para;<br>tion. Ante, at 5. The Court also rightly rejects the base&para;<br>less argument that such expressive activity falls “outside&para;<br>the scope of the First Amendment” merely because “it has&para;<br>legal effect in the electoral process.” Ante, at 6. Yet, the&para;<br>Court does not acknowledge the full constitutional impli&para;<br>cations of these conclusions.&para;<br>The expressive political activity of signing a referendum&para;<br>petition is a paradigmatic example of “the practice of&para;<br>persons sharing common views banding together to&para;<br>achieve a common end.” Citizens Against Rent Con&para;<br>trol/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290,&para;<br>294 (1981). A referendum supported by only one person’s&para;<br>signature is a nullity; it will never be placed on the ballot.&para;<br>The Doe petitioners recognized as much when they—and&para;<br>more than 120,000 other Washingtonians, see ante, at 3—&para;<br>joined with petitioner Protect Marriage Washington, “a&para;<br>state political action committee” organized under&para;<br>§42.17.040, to effect Protect Marriage Washington’s “major&para;<br>purpose” of collecting enough valid signatures to place&para;<br>Referendum 71 on the general election ballot. App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 29a. For these reasons, signing a referendum&para;<br>petition amounts to “ ‘political association’ ” protected by&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the First Amendment. Citizens Against Rent Control,&para;<br>supra, at 295 (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 15&para;<br>(1976) (per curiam)).&para;<br>This Court has long recognized the “vital relationship&para;<br>between” political association “and privacy in one’s asso&para;<br>ciations,” NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S.&para;<br>449, 462 (1958), and held that “[t]he Constitution protects&para;<br>against the compelled disclosure of political associations&para;<br>and beliefs,” Brown v. Socialist Workers ’74 Campaign&para;<br>Comm. (Ohio), 459 U. S. 87, 91 (1982). This constitutional&para;<br>protection “yield[s] only to a subordinating interest of the&para;<br>State that is compelling, and then only if there is a sub&para;<br>stantial relation between the information sought and an&para;<br>overriding and compelling state interest.” Id., at 91–92&para;<br>(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omit&para;<br>ted). Thus, unlike the Court, I read our precedents to&para;<br>require application of strict scrutiny to laws that compel&para;<br>disclosure of protected First Amendment association.&para;<br>Buckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation, Inc.,&para;<br>525 U. S. 182, 206, 212 (1999) (ACLF) (THOMAS, J., con&para;<br>curring in judgment). Under that standard, a disclosure&para;<br>requirement passes constitutional muster only if it is&para;<br>narrowly tailored—i.e., the least restrictive means—to&para;<br>serve a compelling state interest. See id., at 206.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Washington’s application of the PRA to a referendum&para;<br>petition does not survive strict scrutiny.&para;<br>1&para;<br>Washington first contends that it has a compelling&para;<br>interest in “transparency and accountability,” which it&para;<br>claims encompasses several subordinate interests: pre&para;<br>serving the integrity of its election process, preventing&para;<br>corruption, deterring fraud, and correcting mistakes by&para;<br>the secretary of state or by petition signers. See Brief for&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent Reed 40–42; 57–59.&para;<br>It is true that a State has a substantial interest in regu&para;<br>lating its referendum and initiative processes “to protect&para;<br>the[ir] integrity and reliability.” ACLF, 525 U. S., at 191.&para;<br>But Washington points to no precedent from this Court&para;<br>recognizing “correcting errors” as a distinct compelling&para;<br>interest that could support disclosure regulations. And&para;<br>our cases strongly suggest that preventing corruption and&para;<br>deterring fraud bear less weight in this particular elec&para;<br>toral context: the signature-gathering stage of a referen&para;<br>dum or initiative drive. The Court has twice observed that&para;<br>“ ‘the risk of fraud or corruption, or the appearance&para;<br>thereof, is more remote at the petition stage of an initia&para;<br>tive than at the time of balloting.’ ” Id., at 203 (quoting&para;<br>Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 427 (1988)). Similarly,&para;<br>because “[r]eferenda are held on issues, not candidates for&para;<br>public office,” the “risk of corruption perceived in cases&para;<br>involving candidate elections simply is not present in a&para;<br>popular vote on a public issue.” First Nat. Bank of Boston&para;<br>v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 790 (1978) (citations omitted).&para;<br>We should not abandon those principles merely because&para;<br>Washington and its amici can point to a mere eight in&para;<br>stances of initiative-related fraud, see Brief for Respon&para;<br>dent Reed 42; Brief for State of Ohio et al. as Amici Curiae&para;<br>22–24, among the 809 initiative measures placed on&para;<br>state ballots in this country between 1988 and 2008,&para;<br>see Initiative and Referendum Institute, Initiative Use&para;<br>2 (Feb. 2009), online at http://www.iandrinstitute.org/&para;<br>IRI%20Initiative%20Use%20(1904-2008).pdf (as visited&para;<br>June 21, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).&para;<br>If anything, these meager figures reinforce the conclusion&para;<br>that the risks of fraud or corruption in the initiative and&para;<br>referendum process are remote and thereby undermine&para;<br>Washington’s claim that those two interests should be&para;<br>considered compelling for purposes of strict scrutiny.&para;<br>Thus, I am not persuaded that Washington’s interest in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>protecting the integrity and reliability of its referendum&para;<br>process, as the State has defined that interest, is compel&para;<br>ling. But I need not answer that question here. Even&para;<br>assuming the interest is compelling, on-demand disclosure&para;<br>of a referendum petition to any person under the PRA is “a&para;<br>blunderbuss approach” to furthering that interest, Colo&para;<br>rado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal&para;<br>Election Comm’n, 518 U. S. 604, 642 (1996) (THOMAS, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment and dissenting in part) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted), not the least restrictive means&para;<br>of doing so. The events that prompted petitioners’ com&para;<br>plaint in this case demonstrate as much.&para;<br>As Washington explained during oral argument, after&para;<br>the secretary of state receives signed referendum peti&para;<br>tions, his “first step . . . is to take them to his archiving&para;<br>section and to have them digitized. As soon as they’re&para;<br>digitized, they’re available on disks for anyone who re&para;<br>quests them” under the PRA. Tr. of Oral Arg. 30. In this&para;<br>case, two organizations announced their intention to&para;<br>obtain the digitized names and addresses of referendum&para;<br>signers and post them “online, in a searchable format.”&para;<br>Ante, at 3.&para;<br>There is no apparent reason why Washington must&para;<br>broadly disclose referendum signers’ names and addresses&para;<br>in this manner to vindicate the interest that it invokes&para;<br>here. Washington—which is in possession of that infor&para;<br>mation because of referendum regulations that petitioners&para;<br>do not challenge, see supra, at 2—could put the names and&para;<br>addresses of referendum signers into a similar electronic&para;<br>database that state employees could search without sub&para;<br>jecting the name and address of each signer to wholesale&para;<br>public disclosure. The secretary could electronically cross&para;<br>reference the referendum database against the “statewide&para;<br>voter registration list” contained in Washington’s “state&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>wide voter registration database,” §29A.08.651(1),2 to&para;<br>ensure that each referendum signer meets Washington’s&para;<br>residency and voter registration requirements, see&para;<br>§29A.72.130. Doing so presumably would drastically&para;<br>reduce or eliminate possible errors or mistakes that Wash&para;<br>ington argues the secretary might make, see Brief for&para;<br>Respondent Reed 42, since it would allow the secretary to&para;<br>verify virtually all of the signatures instead of the mere “3&para;<br>to 5%” he “ordinarily checks,” ante, at 9 (internal quota&para;<br>tion marks omitted).3&para;<br>An electronic referendum database would also enable&para;<br>the secretary to determine whether multiple entries corre&para;<br>spond to a single registered voter, thereby detecting&para;<br>whether a voter had signed the petition more than once.&para;<br>In addition, the database would protect victims of “for&para;<br>gery” or “ ‘bait and switch’ fraud.” Ibid. In Washington, “a&para;<br>unique identifier is assigned to each legally registered&para;<br>voter in the state.” §29A.08.651(4). Washington could&para;<br>create a Web site, linked to the electronic referendum&para;<br>database, where a voter concerned that his name had been&para;<br>fraudulently signed could conduct a search using his&para;<br>unique identifier to ensure that his name was absent from&para;<br>the database—without requiring disclosure of the names&para;<br>and addresses of all the voluntary, legitimate signers.&para;<br>Washington admits that creating this sort of electronic&para;<br>referendum database “could be done.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 51.&para;<br>Implementing such a system would not place a heavy&para;<br>burden on Washington; “the Secretary of State’s staff”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Under&para;<br>&para;<br>Washington law, this “computerized list must serve as the&para;<br>single system for storing and maintaining the official list of registered&para;<br>voters throughout the state” and “must contain the name and registra&para;<br>tion information of every legally registered voter in the state.” Wash.&para;<br>Rev. Code §§29A.08.651(2)–(3) (2008).&para;<br>3 See §29A.72.230 (permitting the secretary of state to verify and&para;<br>canvass referendum petitions using approved statistical sampling&para;<br>methods).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>already uses an “electronic voter registration database” in&para;<br>its “verification process.” Id., at 50.&para;<br>Washington nevertheless contends that its citizens must&para;<br>“have access to public records . . . to independently evalu&para;<br>ate whether the Secretary properly determined to certify&para;<br>or not to certify a referendum to the ballot.” Brief for&para;<br>Respondent Reed 41. “[W]ithout the access to signed&para;<br>petitions that the PRA provides,” Washington argues, its&para;<br>“citizens could not fulfill their role as the final judge of&para;<br>public business.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>But Washington’s Election Code already gives Washing&para;<br>ton voters access to referendum petition data. Under&para;<br>§29A.72.230, “[t]he verification and canvass of signatures&para;<br>on the [referendum] petition may be observed by persons&para;<br>representing the advocates and opponents of the proposed&para;<br>measure so long as they make no record of the names,&para;<br>addresses, or other information on the petitions or related&para;<br>records except upon” court order. Each side is entitled to&para;<br>at least two such observers, although the secretary may&para;<br>increase that number if, in his opinion, doing so would not&para;<br>“cause undue delay or disruption of the verification proc&para;<br>ess.” Ibid.&para;<br>Washington does not explain why this existing access,&para;<br>which petitioners do not challenge here, is insufficient to&para;<br>permit its citizens to oversee the verification process un&para;<br>der §29A.72.230, or to decide intelligently whether to&para;<br>pursue a court challenge under §29A.72.240. Moreover, if&para;<br>Washington had implemented the more narrowly tailored&para;<br>electronic referendum database discussed above, observers&para;<br>could see the secretary of state’s employees examine the&para;<br>data using exactly the same techniques they would use if&para;<br>the data were released to them under the PRA. Obtaining&para;<br>a digitized list to navigate on their own computer would&para;<br>not allow an observer to learn any additional information.&para;<br>Washington law also contains several other measures&para;<br>that preserve the integrity of the referendum process.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>First, it is a crime in Washington to forge a signature on a&para;<br>referendum petition, or to knowingly sign one more than&para;<br>once. See §29A.84.230. Second, referendum supporters&para;<br>must gather a large number of valid signatures—four&para;<br>percent of the votes cast for Governor in the immediately&para;<br>preceding gubernatorial election—to place a referendum&para;<br>petition on the ballot. §29A.72.150. Third, Washington’s&para;<br>required referendum petition form limits each petition to a&para;<br>single subject. See §29A.72.130. Fourth, a large, plainEnglish warning must appear at the top of the referendum&para;<br>petition, alerting signers to the law’s requirements. See&para;<br>§29A.72.140. Fifth, Washington prescribes the text of the&para;<br>declaration that a circulator must submit along with the&para;<br>signed petition sheets. See §29A.72.130. Sixth, Washing&para;<br>ton prescribes verification and canvassing methods. See&para;<br>§29A.72.230.&para;<br>The Court’s dismissive treatment of those provisions,&para;<br>see ante, at 9, is perplexing, given the analysis that the&para;<br>Court endorsed in ACLF. There, the Court held that two&para;<br>disclosure requirements governing Colorado’s initiative&para;<br>process were unconstitutional, see 525 U. S., at 186–187,&para;<br>specifically finding that they were “not warranted by the&para;<br>state interests (administrative efficiency, fraud detection,&para;<br>informing voters) alleged to justify” them, and emphasiz&para;<br>ing that its “judgment [wa]s informed by other means&para;<br>Colorado employs to accomplish its regulatory purposes.”&para;<br>Id., at 192. The entire last section of the Court’s opinion&para;<br>detailed those “less problematic measures” by which Colo&para;<br>rado “can and d[id] meet” its “substantial interests in&para;<br>regulating the ballot-initiative process.” Id., at 204 (em&para;<br>phasis added). With one exception—a law deeming an&para;<br>initiative void if the circulator violated any law applicable&para;<br>to the circulation process—those Colorado laws correspond&para;<br>exactly to the Washington regulatory requirements listed&para;<br>above. See id., at 205. Including the observer provision,&para;<br>§29A.72.230, and the provision permitting court review of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the secretary’s decision to certify (or not to certify) a refer&para;<br>endum petition, §29A.72.240, Washington thus appears to&para;<br>provide even more of the “less problematic measures” than&para;<br>Colorado did to “protect the integrity of the initiative&para;<br>process,” ACLF, supra, at 204, and I see no reason why&para;<br>Washington’s identical provisions should not “inform” the&para;<br>analysis here.&para;<br>It is readily apparent that Washington can vindicate its&para;<br>stated interest in “transparency and accountability”&para;<br>through a number of more narrowly tailored means than&para;<br>wholesale public disclosure. Accordingly, this interest&para;<br>cannot justify applying the PRA to a referendum petition.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Washington also contends that it has a compelling&para;<br>interest in “providing relevant information to Washington&para;<br>voters,” and that on-demand disclosure to the public is a&para;<br>narrowly tailored means of furthering that interest. Brief&para;<br>for Respondent Reed 44. This argument is easily dis&para;<br>patched, since this Court has already rejected it in a simi&para;<br>lar context.&para;<br>In McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 U. S. 334&para;<br>(1995), the Court held that an Ohio law prohibiting&para;<br>anonymous political pamphleting violated the First&para;<br>Amendment. One of the interests Ohio had invoked to&para;<br>justify that law was identical to Washington’s here: the&para;<br>“interest in providing the electorate with relevant infor&para;<br>mation.” Id., at 348. The Court called that interest&para;<br>“plainly insufficient to support the constitutionality of&para;<br>[Ohio’s] disclosure requirement.” Id., at 349. “The simple&para;<br>interest in providing voters with additional relevant in&para;<br>formation does not justify a state requirement that a&para;<br>writer make statements or disclosures she would other&para;<br>wise omit.” Id., at 348. “Don’t underestimate the common&para;<br>man,” we advised. Id., at 348, n. 11 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted).&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“People are intelligent enough to evaluate the source&para;<br>of an anonymous writing. They can see it is anony&para;<br>mous. They know it is anonymous. They can evalu&para;<br>ate its anonymity along with its message. . . . And&para;<br>then, once they have done so, it is for them to decide&para;<br>what is ‘responsible,’ what is valuable, and what is&para;<br>truth.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>See also Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 777 (“The inherent worth of&para;<br>the speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public&para;<br>does not depend upon the identity of its source”).&para;<br>This observation applies equally to referendum meas&para;<br>ures. People are intelligent enough to evaluate the merits&para;<br>of a referendum without knowing who supported it. Thus,&para;<br>just as this informational interest did not justify the Ohio&para;<br>law in McIntyre, it does not justify applying the PRA to&para;<br>referendum petitions.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The foregoing analysis applies in every case involving&para;<br>disclosure of a referendum measure’s supporters, as it&para;<br>must for petitioners’ facial challenge to succeed. See&para;<br>Washington State Grange, 552 U. S., at 449 (quoting&para;<br>Salerno, 481 U. S., at 745). Washington does not argue&para;<br>that the strength of its transparency and accountability&para;<br>interest rises or falls based on the topic of a referendum.&para;<br>Nor would such an argument be convincing. We have no&para;<br>basis to assume that Washington’s interest in maintaining&para;<br>the integrity of its referendum process is high for a char&para;<br>ter-school referendum but low for an unemployment in&para;<br>surance referendum, or that a library or land-use referen&para;<br>dum is more likely to be a target of fraud or corruption&para;<br>than a referendum on insurance coverage and benefits.&para;<br>See ante, at 11–12. The strength of Washington’s interest&para;<br>remains constant across all types of referendum measures.&para;<br>So too does the strength of a signer’s First Amendment&para;<br>interest. The First Amendment rights at issue here are&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>associational rights, and a long, unbroken line of this&para;<br>Court’s precedents holds that privacy of association is&para;<br>protected under the First Amendment. See supra, at 4–5.&para;<br>The loss of associational privacy that comes with disclos&para;<br>ing referendum petitions to the general public under the&para;<br>PRA constitutes the same harm as to each signer of each&para;<br>referendum, regardless of the topic. To be sure, a referen&para;<br>dum signer may be more willing to disclose to the general&para;<br>public his political association with persons signing cer&para;<br>tain referendum measures than his association with oth&para;<br>ers. But that choice belongs to the voter; the State may&para;<br>not make it for him by ascribing a lower level of First&para;<br>Amendment protection to an associational interest that&para;<br>some think a voter may be (or should be) more willing to&para;<br>disclose. Cf. Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of&para;<br>Va., 515 U. S. 819, 828 (1995) (“In the realm of private&para;<br>speech or expression, government regulation may not&para;<br>favor one speaker over another”).&para;<br>Finally, the less restrictive means available to vindicate&para;<br>Washington’s transparency and accountability interest&para;<br>can be employed for all referendum measures, regardless&para;<br>of topic. There is nothing measure-specific about an elec&para;<br>tronic database or additional observers. And the forgery&para;<br>prohibition and other existing requirements in Washing&para;<br>ton law that help “protect the integrity of the initiative&para;<br>process,” ACLF, 525 U. S., at 204, apply equally to all&para;<br>referendum measures.&para;<br>Because the strength of Washington’s interest in trans&para;<br>parency and a signer’s individual First Amendment inter&para;<br>est in privacy of political association remain constant&para;<br>across all referendum topics, and because less restrictive&para;<br>means to protect the integrity of the referendum process&para;<br>are not topic specific, I would hold that on-demand public&para;<br>disclosure of referendum petitions under the PRA is not&para;<br>narrowly tailored for any referendum.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>III&para;<br>Significant practical problems will result from requiring&para;<br>as-applied challenges to protect referendum signers’ con&para;<br>stitutional rights.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Court’s approach will “require substantial litigation&para;<br>over an extended time” before a potential signer of any&para;<br>referendum will learn whether, if he signs a referendum,&para;<br>his associational privacy right will remain intact. Citizens&para;<br>United v. Federal Election Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2010) (slip op., at 9). And the tenacious litigant’s reward&para;<br>for trying to protect his First Amendment rights? An&para;<br>“interpretive process [that] itself would create an inevita&para;<br>ble, pervasive, and serious risk of chilling protected speech&para;<br>pending the drawing of fine distinctions that, in the end,&para;<br>would themselves be questionable.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>9–10). The large number of such fine and questionable&para;<br>distinctions in these types of cases reinforces my view that&para;<br>as-applied challenges provide no more than “a hollow&para;<br>assurance” that referendum signers’ First Amendment&para;<br>rights will be protected. Id., at __ (slip op., at 5) (THOMAS,&para;<br>J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Consider&para;<br>just a few examples.&para;<br>In Washington, a referendum sponsor must file the&para;<br>proposed referendum with the secretary of state before&para;<br>collecting signatures. See §29A.72.010. May the sponsor&para;<br>seek an injunction against disclosure through an as&para;<br>applied challenge before filing the proposed measure, or&para;<br>simultaneously with its filing?&para;<br>Because signature&para;<br>gathering will not have started, the sponsor will not be&para;<br>able to present any evidence specific to signers or potential&para;<br>signers of that particular referendum showing “a reason&para;<br>able probability that the compelled disclosure [of personal&para;<br>information] will subject them to threats, harassment, or&para;<br>reprisals from either Government officials or private&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>parties.” Ante, at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Thus, to succeed at that stage of litigation, plaintiffs must&para;<br>point to (at least) one other instance of harassment arising&para;<br>from a similar referendum. The Court has never held that&para;<br>such evidence would be acceptable; but if it is, that neces&para;<br>sarily means that some signers, at some point, will have&para;<br>suffered actual “threats, harassment, and reprisals” for&para;<br>engaging in protected First Amendment activity.&para;<br>If the sponsor must wait at least until signature&para;<br>gathering has started on his referendum to file an as&para;<br>applied challenge, it is still unclear what sort of evidence&para;<br>of “threats, harassment, or reprisals” directed toward his&para;<br>supporters would satisfy the Court’s standard. How many&para;<br>instances of “threats, harassment or reprisals” must a&para;<br>signer endure before a court may grant relief on an as&para;<br>applied challenge? And how dispersed throughout the&para;<br>group of the necessary 120,000 signers, see ante, at 3,&para;<br>must these threats be?&para;<br>More importantly, the Court’s standard does not appear&para;<br>to require actual “threats, harassment, or reprisals,” but&para;<br>merely a “ ‘reasonable probability’ ” that disclosure of the&para;<br>signers’ names and addresses will lead to such activity.&para;<br>Ante, at 11 (emphasis added). What sort of evidence suf&para;<br>fices to satisfy this apparently more relaxed, though per&para;<br>haps more elusive, standard? Does one instance of actual&para;<br>harassment directed toward one signer mean that the&para;<br>“reasonable probability” requirement is met? And again,&para;<br>how widespread must this “reasonable probability” be?&para;<br>The Court does not answer any of these questions, leaving&para;<br>a vacuum to be filled on a case-by-case basis. This will, no&para;<br>doubt, result in the “drawing of” arbitrary and “question&para;<br>able” “fine distinctions” by even the most well-intentioned&para;<br>district or circuit judge. Citizens United, 558 U. S., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 9–10).&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v. REED &para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>&para;<br>In addition, as I have previously explained, the state of&para;<br>technology today creates at least some probability that&para;<br>signers of every referendum will be subjected to threats,&para;<br>harassment, or reprisals if their personal information is&para;<br>disclosed. “ ‘[T]he advent of the Internet’ enables” rapid&para;<br>dissemination of “ ‘the information needed’ to” threaten or&para;<br>harass every referendum signer. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6)&para;<br>(opinion of THOMAS, J.). “Thus, ‘disclosure permits citi&para;<br>zens . . . to react to the speech of [their political opponents]&para;<br>in a proper’—or undeniably improper—‘way’ long before a&para;<br>plaintiff could prevail on an as-applied challenge.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Court apparently disagrees, asserting that “there is&para;<br>no reason to assume that any burdens imposed by disclo&para;<br>sure of typical referendum petitions would be remotely&para;<br>like the burdens plaintiffs fear in this case.” Ante, at 12.&para;<br>That conclusion rests on the premise that some referen&para;<br>dum measures are so benign that the fact of public dis&para;<br>closure will not chill protected First Amendment activity.&para;<br>I am not convinced that this premise is correct.&para;<br>The historical evidence shows that the referendum and&para;<br>initiative process first gained popularity as a means of&para;<br>“provid[ing] an occasional safety valve for interests that&para;<br>failed to get a fair hearing in the legislatures.” T. Cronin,&para;<br>Direct Democracy: The Politics of Initiative, Referendum,&para;<br>and Recall 59 (1989). Unsurprisingly, such interests&para;<br>tended to be controversial by nature. Early examples&para;<br>include “the single tax, prohibition, women’s suffrage,&para;<br>prolabor legislation, and the graduated income tax.” Id.,&para;<br>at 58. And proponents of initiative measures tended to&para;<br>include politically marginalized groups such as the&para;<br>“Farmer’s Alliance” in rural states; “[t]housands of labor&para;<br>federations, notably the miners”; and “the Women’s Suf&para;<br>frage Association,” which “saw the initiative and referen&para;<br>dum as a possible new means to overcome” repeated failed&para;<br>attempts in state legislatures to secure for women the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Id., at 50–51.&para;<br>These characteristics of initiative and referendum&para;<br>drives persist today. Consider, for example, the goal of&para;<br>increasing ethics in government—a seemingly laudable&para;<br>and unobjectionable goal. So thought some citizens of&para;<br>Utah, who, frustrated with the state legislature’s failure to&para;<br>pass ethics laws commensurate with their preferences,&para;<br>filed a “21-page initiative target[ing] legislative conduct&para;<br>with a broad array of reforms that would significantly&para;<br>change how business gets done on Utah’s Capitol Hill.”&para;<br>McKitrick, Suit Demands Secrecy for Ethics Petition&para;<br>Signers, Salt Lake Tribune, Apr. 15, 2010, p. A4 (hereinaf&para;<br>ter Salt Lake Tribune). But Utah law provides that&para;<br>“[i]nitiative packets,” which contain the names and ad&para;<br>dresses (and, in some cases, birthdates) of petition signers,&para;<br>“are public once they are delivered to the county clerks”&para;<br>for verification and canvassing. Utah Code Ann. §20A–7–&para;<br>206(7) (2009 Lexis Supp. Pamphlet).&para;<br>The attorneys sponsoring that initiative moved for an&para;<br>injunction to prevent disclosure of the initiative packets&para;<br>under §20A–7–206(7) because, they claimed, “ ‘[t]he [state]&para;<br>Republican Party has said it will target our folks.’ ” Salt&para;<br>Lake Tribune, at A4. According to these attorneys, a&para;<br>facially benign initiative may well result in political retri&para;<br>bution and retaliation in a State where Republicans cur&para;<br>rently hold the offices of Governor, Lieutenant Governor,&para;<br>attorney general, state treasurer, state auditor, and a&para;<br>supermajority in both the Utah House of Representatives&para;<br>(71%) and the Utah Senate (72%), see State Yellow Book:&para;<br>Who’s Who in the Executive and Legislative Branches of&para;<br>the 50 State Governments 650–651, 1292–1294 (Spring&para;<br>2010), as well as four of the five seats in the State’s dele&para;<br>gation to the United States Congress, see GPO, 2009–2010&para;<br>Official Congressional Directory, 111th Cong., pp. 299, 307&para;<br>(2009).&para;<br>The difficulty in predicting which referendum measures&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>DOE v.
