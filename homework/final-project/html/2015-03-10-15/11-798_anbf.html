CITY&para;<br>OF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–798.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued April 16, 2013—Decided June 13, 2013&para;<br>&para;<br>The Port of Los Angeles, a division of the City of Los Angeles, is run by&para;<br>a Board of Harbor Commissioners pursuant to a municipal ordinance&para;<br>known as a tariff. The Port leases marine terminal facilities to operators that load cargo onto and unload it from docking ships. Federally licensed short-haul trucks, called “drayage trucks,” assist in those&para;<br>operations by moving cargo into and out of the Port. In 2007, in response to community concerns over the impact of a proposed port expansion on traffic, the environment, and safety, the Board implemented a Clean Truck Program. As part of that program, the Board&para;<br>devised a standard-form “concession agreement” to govern the relationship between the Port and drayage companies. The agreement&para;<br>requires a company to affix a placard on each truck with a phone&para;<br>number for reporting concerns, and to submit a plan listing off-street&para;<br>parking locations for each truck. Other requirements relate to a&para;<br>company’s financial capacity, its maintenance of trucks, and its employment of drivers. The concession agreement sets out penalties for&para;<br>violations, including possible suspension or revocation of the right to&para;<br>provide drayage services. The Board also amended the Port’s tariff to&para;<br>ensure that every drayage company would enter into the agreement.&para;<br>The amended tariff makes it a misdemeanor, punishable by fine or&para;<br>imprisonment, for a terminal operator to grant access to an unregistered drayage truck.&para;<br>Petitioner American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA), whose&para;<br>members include many of the drayage companies at the Port, sued&para;<br>the Port and City, seeking an injunction against the concession&para;<br>agreement’s requirements. ATA principally contended that the requirements are expressly preempted by the Federal Aviation Admin-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>istration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA), see 49 U. S. C.&para;<br>§14501(c)(1). ATA also argued that even if the requirements are valid, Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines, Inc., 348 U. S. 61, prevents the Port&para;<br>from enforcing the requirements by withdrawing a defaulting company’s right to operate at the Port. The District Court held that neither&para;<br>§14501(c)(1) nor Castle prevented the Port from proceeding with its&para;<br>program. The Ninth Circuit mainly affirmed, finding only the driveremployment provision preempted and rejecting petitioner’s Castle&para;<br>claim.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The FAAAA expressly preempts the concession agreement’s&para;<br>placard and parking requirements. Section 14501(c)(1) preempts a&para;<br>state “law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect&para;<br>of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . .&para;<br>with respect to the transportation of property.”&para;<br>49 U. S. C.&para;<br>§14501(c)(1). Because the parties agree that the Port’s placard and&para;<br>parking requirements relate to a motor carrier’s price, route, or service with respect to transporting property, the only disputed question&para;<br>is whether those requirements “hav[e] the force and effect of law.”&para;<br>Section 14501(c)(1) draws a line between a government’s exercise of&para;<br>regulatory authority and its own contract-based participation in a&para;<br>market. The statute’s “force and effect of law” language excludes&para;<br>from the clause’s scope contractual arrangements made by a State&para;<br>when it acts as a market participant, not as a regulator. See, e.g.,&para;<br>American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U. S. 219, 229. But here, the&para;<br>Port exercised classic regulatory authority in imposing the placard&para;<br>and parking requirements.&para;<br>It forced terminal operators—and&para;<br>through them, trucking companies—to alter their conduct by implementing a criminal prohibition punishable by imprisonment. That&para;<br>counts as action “having the force and effect of law” if anything does.&para;<br>The Port’s primary argument to the contrary focuses on motives rather than means. But the Port’s proprietary intentions do not control. When the government employs a coercive mechanism, available&para;<br>to no private party, it acts with the force and effect of law, whether or&para;<br>not it does so to turn a profit. Only if it forgoes the (distinctively governmental) exercise of legal authority may it escape §14501(c)(1)’s&para;<br>preemptive scope. That the criminal sanctions fall on terminal operators, not directly on the trucking companies, also makes no difference. See, e.g., Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., 552&para;<br>U. S. 364, 371–373. Pp. 6−10.&para;<br>2. This Court declines to decide in the case’s present, preenforcement posture whether Castle limits the way the Port can enforce the financial-capacity and truck-maintenance requirements upheld by the Ninth Circuit.

But Castle does not prevent a&para;<br>State from taking off the road a vehicle that is contemporaneously&para;<br>out of compliance with such regulations.

We hold that the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA) expressly&para;<br>preempts two of the contract’s provisions, which require&para;<br>such a company to develop an off-street parking plan and&para;<br>display designated placards on its vehicles. We decline to&para;<br>decide in the case’s present, pre-enforcement posture&para;<br>whether, under Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines, Inc., 348&para;<br>U. S. 61 (1954), federal law governing licenses for interstate motor carriers prevents the Port from using the&para;<br>agreement’s penalty clause to punish violations of other,&para;<br>non-preempted provisions.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Port of Los Angeles, a division of the City of Los&para;<br>Angeles, is the largest port in the country. The Port owns&para;<br>marine terminal facilities, which it leases to “terminal&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>operators” (such as shipping lines and stevedoring companies) that load cargo onto and unload it from docking&para;<br>ships. Short-haul trucks, called “drayage trucks,” move&para;<br>the cargo into and out of the Port. The trucking companies providing those drayage services are all federally&para;<br>licensed motor carriers. Before the events giving rise&para;<br>to this case, they contracted with terminal operators to&para;<br>transport cargo, but did not enter into agreements with&para;<br>the Port itself.&para;<br>The City’s Board of Harbor Commissioners runs the&para;<br>Port pursuant to a municipal ordinance known as a tariff,&para;<br>which sets out various regulations and charges. In the&para;<br>late 1990’s, the Board decided to enlarge the Port’s facilities to accommodate more ships. Neighborhood and environmental groups objected to the proposed expansion,&para;<br>arguing that it would increase congestion and air pollution&para;<br>and decrease safety in the surrounding area. A lawsuit&para;<br>they brought, and another they threatened, stymied the&para;<br>Board’s development project for almost 10 years.&para;<br>To address the community’s concerns, the Board implemented a Clean Truck Program beginning in 2007.&para;<br>Among other actions, the Board devised a standard-form&para;<br>“concession agreement” to govern the relationship between&para;<br>the Port and any trucking company seeking to operate on&para;<br>the premises. Under that contract, a company may&para;<br>transport cargo at the Port in exchange for complying with&para;<br>various requirements. The two directly at issue here&para;<br>compel the company to (1) affix a placard on each truck&para;<br>with a phone number for reporting environmental or&para;<br>safety concerns (You’ve seen the type: “How am I driving?&para;<br>213–867–5309”) and (2) submit a plan listing off-street&para;<br>parking locations for each truck when not in service.&para;<br>Three other provisions in the agreement, formerly disputed in this litigation, relate to the company’s financial&para;<br>capacity, its maintenance of trucks, and its employment of&para;<br>drivers.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The Board then amended the Port’s tariff to ensure that&para;<br>every company providing drayage services at the facility&para;<br>would enter into the concession agreement. The mechanism the Board employed is a criminal prohibition on&para;<br>terminal operators. The amended tariff provides that “no&para;<br>Terminal Operator shall permit access into any Terminal&para;<br>in the Port of Los Angeles to any Drayage Truck unless&para;<br>such Drayage Truck is registered under a Concession&para;<br>[Agreement].” App. 105. A violation of that provision—&para;<br>which occurs “each and every day” a terminal operator&para;<br>provides access to an unregistered truck—is a misdemeanor. Id., at 86. It is punishable by a fine of up to $500&para;<br>or a prison sentence of up to six months. Id., at 85–86.&para;<br>The concession agreement itself spells out penalties for&para;<br>any signatory trucking company that violates its requirements. When a company commits a “Minor Default,” the&para;<br>Port may issue a warning letter or order the company to&para;<br>undertake “corrective action,” complete a “course of . . .&para;<br>training,” or pay the costs of the Port’s investigation. Id.,&para;<br>at 81–82. When a company commits a “Major Default,”&para;<br>the Port may also suspend or revoke the company’s right&para;<br>to provide drayage services at the Port. Id., at 82. The&para;<br>agreement, however, does not specify which breaches of&para;<br>the contract qualify as “Major,” rather than “Minor.” And&para;<br>the parties agree that the Port has never suspended or&para;<br>revoked a trucking company’s license to operate at the&para;<br>Port for a prior violation of one of the contract provisions&para;<br>involved in this case.

(ATA),&para;<br>is a national trade association representing the trucking&para;<br>industry, including drayage companies that operate at the&para;<br>Port. ATA filed suit against the Port and City, seeking an&para;<br>injunction against the five provisions of the concession&para;<br>agreement discussed above. The complaint principally&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>contended that §14501(c)(1) of the FAAAA expressly&para;<br>preempts those requirements. That statutory section&para;<br>states:&para;<br>“[A] State [or local government] may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the&para;<br>force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property.” 49 U. S. C. §14501(c)(1).1&para;<br>ATA also offered a back-up argument: Even if the requirements are valid, ATA claimed, the Port may not&para;<br>enforce them by withdrawing a defaulting company’s right&para;<br>to operate at the Port. That argument rested on Castle v.&para;<br>Hayes Freight Lines, Inc., 348 U. S. 61 (1954), which held&para;<br>that Illinois could not bar a federally licensed motor carrier from its highways for prior violations of state safety&para;<br>regulations. We reasoned in Castle that the State’s action&para;<br>conflicted with federal law providing for certification of&para;<br>motor carriers; and ATA argued here that a similar conflict would inhere in applying the concession agreement to&para;<br>suspend or revoke a trucking company’s privileges. Following a bench trial, the District Court held that neither&para;<br>§14501(c)(1) nor Castle prevents the Port from proceeding&para;<br>with any part of its Clean Truck Program.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit mainly affirmed. Most important for our purposes, the court held&para;<br>that §14501(c)(1) does not preempt the agreement’s plac——————&para;<br>1 ATA also contended that a separate provision, 49 U. S. C. §14506(a),&para;<br>preempts the agreement’s placard requirement. That section bars state&para;<br>and local governments from enacting or enforcing “any law, rule,&para;<br>regulation[,] standard, or other provision having the force and effect of&para;<br>law” that obligates a motor carrier to display any form of identification&para;<br>other than those the Secretary of Transportation has required. Ibid.&para;<br>The just-quoted language is the only part of §14506(a) disputed here,&para;<br>and it is materially identical to language in §14501(c)(1). We focus on&para;<br>§14501(c)(1) for ease of reference, but everything we say about that&para;<br>provision also applies to §14506(a).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

The court reasoned that&para;<br>those requirements, rather than regulating the drayage&para;<br>market, advance the Port’s own “business interest” in&para;<br>“managing its facilities.” Id., at 401. Both provisions were&para;<br>“designed to address [a] specific proprietary problem[ ]”—&para;<br>the need to “increase the community good-will necessary&para;<br>to facilitate Port expansion.” Id., at 406–407; see id., at&para;<br>409.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit also held the agreement’s&para;<br>financial-capacity and truck-maintenance provisions not&para;<br>Section&para;<br>preempted, for reasons not relevant here.2&para;<br>14501(c)(1), the court decided, preempts only the contract’s&para;<br>employment provision. Finally, the Ninth Circuit rejected&para;<br>ATA’s claim that Castle bars the Port from applying the&para;<br>agreement’s penalty clause to withdraw a trucking company’s right to operate at the facility. The court thought&para;<br>Castle inapplicable because of the narrower exclusion in&para;<br>this case: “Unlike a ban on using all of a State’s freeways,”&para;<br>the court reasoned, “a limitation on access to a single Port&para;<br>does not prohibit motor carriers” from generally participating in interstate commerce. 660 F. 3d, at 403.&para;<br>We granted certiorari to resolve two questions: first,&para;<br>whether §14501(c)(1) of the FAAAA preempts the concession agreement’s placard and parking provisions; and&para;<br>second, whether Castle precludes reliance on the agreement’s penalty clause to suspend or revoke a trucking&para;<br>company’s privileges. See 568 U. S. ___ (2013). Contrary&para;<br>to the Ninth Circuit, we hold that the placard and parking&para;<br>requirements are preempted as “provision[s] having the&para;<br>force and effect of law.” That determination does not&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 For those curious, the court held that the financial-capacity requirement is not “ ‘related to a [motor carrier’s] price, route, or service,’ ”&para;<br>and that the truck-maintenance requirement falls within a statutory&para;<br>exception for safety regulation. 660 F. 3d, at 395, 403–406 (quoting&para;<br>§14501(c)(1)); see §14501(c)(2)(A) (safety exception).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>obviate the enforcement issue arising from Castle because&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit’s rulings upholding the agreement’s&para;<br>financial-capacity and truck-maintenance provisions have&para;<br>now become final;3 accordingly, the Port could try to apply&para;<br>its penalty provision to trucking companies that have&para;<br>violated those surviving requirements. But we nonetheless decline to address the Castle question because the&para;<br>case’s pre-enforcement posture obscures the nature of the&para;<br>agreement’s remedial scheme, rendering any decision at&para;<br>this point a shot in the dark.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Section 14501(c)(1), once again, preempts a state “law,&para;<br>regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of&para;<br>law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property.” All&para;<br>parties agree that the Port’s placard and parking requirements relate to a motor carrier’s price, route, or service&para;<br>with respect to transporting property. The only disputed&para;<br>question is whether those requirements “hav[e] the force&para;<br>and effect of law.” The Port claims that they do not, because the “concession contract is just [like] a private&para;<br>agreement,” made to advance the Port’s commercial and&para;<br>“proprietary interests.” Brief for Respondent City of Los&para;<br>Angeles et al. 19 (Brief for City of Los Angeles) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted).4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 ATA’s&para;<br>&para;<br>petition for certiorari did not seek review of the Ninth Circuit’s determination that the truck-maintenance provision is valid. The&para;<br>petition did ask us to consider the court’s ruling on the financialcapacity provision, but we declined to do so.&para;<br>4 The Port’s brief occasionally frames the issue differently—as whether&para;<br>a freestanding “market-participant exception” limits §14501(c)(1)’s&para;<br>express terms. See Brief for City of Los Angeles 24. But at oral argument, the Port emphasized that the supposed exception it invoked in&para;<br>fact derives from §14501(c)(1)’s “force and effect of law” language. See&para;<br>Tr. of Oral Arg. 31 (“[W]hat we are calling the market participant&para;<br>exception . . . is generally congruent with[ ] what is meant by Congress&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We can agree with the Port on this premise: Section&para;<br>14501(c)(1) draws a rough line between a government’s&para;<br>exercise of regulatory authority and its own contract-based&para;<br>participation in a market. We recognized that distinction&para;<br>in American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U. S. 219 (1995),&para;<br>when we construed another statute’s near-identical “force&para;<br>and effect of law” language. That phrase, we stated, “connotes official, government-imposed policies” prescribing&para;<br>“binding standards of conduct.” Id., at 229, n. 5 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). And we contrasted that quintessential regulatory action to “contractual commitment[s]&para;<br>voluntarily undertaken.” Id., at 229 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). In Wolens, we addressed a State’s enforcement of an agreement between two private parties.&para;<br>But the same reasoning holds if the government enters&para;<br>into a contract just as a private party would—for example,&para;<br>if a State (or City or Port) signs an agreement with a&para;<br>trucking company to transport goods at a specified price.&para;<br>See, e.g., Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council v. Associated&para;<br>Builders &amp; Contractors of Mass./R. I., Inc., 507 U. S. 218,&para;<br>233 (1993) (When a State acts as a purchaser of services,&para;<br>“it does not ‘regulate’ the workings of the market . . . ;&para;<br>it exemplifies them” (some internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted)). The “force and effect of law” language in&para;<br>§14501(c)(1) excludes such everyday contractual arrangements from the clause’s scope. That phrasing targets the&para;<br>State acting as a State, not as any market actor—or otherwise said, the State acting in a regulatory rather than&para;<br>proprietary mode.&para;<br>But that statutory reading gets the Port nothing, because it exercised classic regulatory authority—complete&para;<br>——————&para;<br>by the term ‘force and effect of law’ ”); id., at 39–40 (“I’m . . . relying on&para;<br>the language . . . force and effect of law,” which “invites a market&para;<br>participant analysis”). We therefore have no occasion to consider&para;<br>whether or when a preemption clause lacking such language would&para;<br>except a state or local government’s proprietary actions.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>with the use of criminal penalties—in imposing the placard and parking requirements at issue here. Consider&para;<br>again how those requirements work. They are, to be sure,&para;<br>contained in contracts between the Port and trucking&para;<br>companies. But those contracts do not stand alone, as the&para;<br>result merely of the parties’ voluntary commitments. The&para;<br>Board of Harbor Commissioners aimed to “require parties&para;<br>who access Port land and terminals for purposes of providing drayage services” to enter into concession agreements with the Port. App. 108 (Board’s “Findings”). And&para;<br>it accomplished that objective by amending the Port’s&para;<br>tariff—a form of municipal ordinance—to provide that “no&para;<br>Terminal Operator shall permit” a drayage truck to gain&para;<br>“access into any Terminal in the Port” unless the truck is&para;<br>“registered under” such a concession agreement. Id., at&para;<br>105. A violation of that tariff provision is a violation of&para;<br>criminal law. And it is punishable by a fine or a prison&para;<br>sentence of up to six months. Id., at 85–86. So the contract here functions as part and parcel of a governmental&para;<br>program wielding coercive power over private parties,&para;<br>backed by the threat of criminal punishment.&para;<br>That counts as action “having the force and effect of&para;<br>law” if anything does. The Port here has not acted as a&para;<br>private party, contracting in a way that the owner of an&para;<br>ordinary commercial enterprise could mimic. Rather, it&para;<br>has forced terminal operators—and through them, trucking companies—to alter their conduct by implementing a&para;<br>criminal prohibition punishable by time in prison. In&para;<br>some cases, the question whether governmental action has&para;<br>the force of law may pose difficulties; the line between&para;<br>regulatory and proprietary conduct has soft edges. But&para;<br>this case takes us nowhere near those uncertain boundaries. Contractual commitments resulting not from ordinary bargaining (as in Wolens), but instead from the&para;<br>threat of criminal sanctions manifest the government qua&para;<br>government, performing its prototypical regulatory role.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

The Port tells the identical&para;<br>story, emphasizing that private companies have similar&para;<br>business incentives to “adopt[ ] ‘green growth’ plans like&para;<br>the Port’s.” Brief for City of Los Angeles 30. We have no&para;<br>reason to doubt that account of events; we can assume the&para;<br>Port acted to enhance goodwill and improve the odds of&para;<br>achieving its business plan—just as a private company&para;<br>might. But the Port’s intentions are not what matters.&para;<br>That is because, as we just described, the Port chose a tool&para;<br>to fulfill those goals which only a government can wield:&para;<br>the hammer of the criminal law. See United Haulers&para;<br>Assn., Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth.,&para;<br>438 F. 3d 150, 157 (CA2 2006), aff ’d, 550 U.

S. 246, 255 (2004) (finding&para;<br>preemption under the Clean Air Act although the requirements directly targeted car buyers rather than&para;<br>sellers). The same goes here. The Port made its regulation of drayage trucks mandatory by imposing criminal&para;<br>penalties on the entities hiring all such trucks at the&para;<br>facility. Slice it or dice it any which way, the Port thus&para;<br>acted with the “force of law.”&para;<br>III&para;<br>Our rejection of the concession agreement’s placard and&para;<br>parking requirements does not conclude this case. Two&para;<br>other provisions of the agreement are now in effect: As&para;<br>noted earlier, the Ninth Circuit upheld the financialcapacity and truck-maintenance requirements, and that&para;<br>part of its decision has become final. See supra, at 5, and&para;<br>n. 2. ATA argues that our holding in Castle limits the way&para;<br>the Port can enforce those remaining requirements. According to ATA, the Port may not rely on the agreement’s&para;<br>penalty provision to suspend or revoke the right of noncomplying trucking companies to operate on the premises.&para;<br>As we have described, Castle rebuffed a State’s attempt&para;<br>to bar a federally licensed motor carrier from its highways&para;<br>for past infringements of state safety regulations. A federal statute, we explained, gave a federal agency the&para;<br>authority to license interstate motor carriers, as well as a&para;<br>carefully circumscribed power to suspend or terminate&para;<br>those licenses for violations of law. That statute, we held,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>implicitly prohibited a State from “tak[ing] action”—like a&para;<br>ban on the use of its highways—“amounting to a suspension or revocation of an interstate carrier’s [federally]&para;<br>granted right to operate.” 348 U. S., at 63–64.&para;<br>The parties here dispute whether Castle restricts the&para;<br>Port’s remedial authority. The Port echoes the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit’s view that banning a truck from “all of a State’s&para;<br>freeways” is meaningfully different from denying it “access&para;<br>to a single Port.” 660 F. 3d, at 403; see Brief for City of&para;<br>Los Angeles 49. ATA responds that because the Port is a&para;<br>“crucial channel of interstate commerce,” Castle applies to&para;<br>it just as much as to roads. Brief for Petitioner 18.&para;<br>But we see another question here: Does the Port’s enforcement scheme involve curtailing drayage trucks’ operations in the way Castle prohibits, even assuming that&para;<br>decision applies to facilities like this one? As just indicated, Castle puts limits on how a State or locality can punish&para;<br>an interstate motor carrier for prior violations of trucking regulations (like the concession agreement’s requirements). Nothing we said there, however, prevents a State&para;<br>from taking off the road a vehicle that is contemporaneously out of compliance with such regulations. Indeed,&para;<br>ATA filed an amicus brief in Castle explaining that a&para;<br>vehicle “that fails to comply with the state’s regulations&para;<br>may be barred from the state’s highways.” Brief for ATA,&para;<br>O. T 1954, No. 44, p. 12; see Brief for Respondent, id.,&para;<br>p. 23 (A State may “stop and prevent from continuing on&para;<br>the highway any motor vehicle which it finds not to be in&para;<br>compliance”). And ATA reiterates that view here, as does&para;<br>the United States as amicus curiae. See Reply Brief 22;&para;<br>Brief for United States 29–30. So the Port would not&para;<br>violate Castle if it barred a truck from operating at its&para;<br>facilities to prevent an ongoing violation of the agreement’s requirements.&para;<br>And at this juncture, we have no basis for finding that&para;<br>the Port will ever use the agreement’s penalty provision&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>for anything more than that. That provision, to be sure,&para;<br>might be read to give the Port broader authority: As noted&para;<br>earlier, the relevant text enables the Port to suspend&para;<br>or revoke a trucking company’s right to provide drayage services at the facility as a “[r]emedy” for a “Major&para;<br>Default.” App. 82; see supra, at 3. But the agreement&para;<br>nowhere states what counts as a “Major Default”—and&para;<br>specifically, whether a company’s breach of the financialcapacity or truck-maintenance requirements would qualify. And the Port has in fact never used its suspension or&para;<br>revocation power to penalize a past violation of those&para;<br>requirements. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 43, 50–51. Indeed, the&para;<br>Port’s brief states that “it does not claim[ ] the authority to&para;<br>punish past, cured violations of the requirements challenged here through suspension or revocation.” Brief for&para;<br>City of Los Angeles 62 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>So the kind of enforcement ATA fears, and believes inconsistent with Castle, might never come to pass at all.&para;<br>In these circumstances, we decide not to decide ATA’s&para;<br>Castle-based challenge. That claim, by its nature, attacks&para;<br>the Port’s enforcement scheme.&para;<br>But given the preenforcement posture of this case, we cannot tell what that&para;<br>scheme entails. It might look like the one forbidden in&para;<br>Castle (as ATA anticipates), or else it might not (as the&para;<br>Port assures us). We see no reason to take a guess now&para;<br>about what the Port will do later. There will be time&para;<br>enough to address the Castle question when, if ever, the&para;<br>Port enforces its agreement in a way arguably violating&para;<br>that decision.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Section 14501(c)(1) of the FAAAA preempts the placard&para;<br>and parking provisions of the Port’s concession agreement.&para;<br>We decline to decide on the present record ATA’s separate&para;<br>challenge, based on Castle, to that agreement’s penalty&para;<br>provision. Accordingly, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>is reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further&para;<br>proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

I write separately to&para;<br>highlight a constitutional concern regarding §601 of the&para;<br>Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994&para;<br>(FAAAA), 108 Stat. 1606, a statute the Court has now&para;<br>considered twice this Term. See Dan’s City Used Cars,&para;<br>Inc. v. Pelkey, 569 U. S. ___ (2013).&para;<br>The Constitution grants Congress authority “[t]o regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.” Art. I, §8,&para;<br>cl. 3 (emphasis added). Section 14501 of Title 49 is titled&para;<br>“Federal authority over intrastate transportation.” (Emphasis added.) The tension between §14501 and the&para;<br>Constitution is apparent, because the Constitution does&para;<br>not give Congress power to regulate intrastate commerce.&para;<br>United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 587, n. 2 (1995)&para;<br>Nevertheless, §14501(c)(1)&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., concurring).&para;<br>purports to pre-empt any state or local law “related to&para;<br>a price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with&para;<br>respect to the transportation of property.” By its terms,&para;<br>§14501(c) would pre-empt even a city ordinance establishing a uniform rate for most transportation services originating and ending inside city limits, so long as the services&para;<br>were provided by a motor carrier. Such an extraordinary&para;<br>assertion of congressional authority cannot be reconciled&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>with our constitutional system of enumerated powers.&para;<br>The Supremacy Clause provides the constitutional basis&para;<br>for the pre-emption of state laws. Art. VI, cl. 2 (“This&para;<br>Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which&para;<br>shall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land”). Because the Constitution and&para;<br>federal laws are supreme, conflicting state laws are without legal effect. See Crosby v. National Foreign Trade&para;<br>Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372 (2000). However, the constitutional text leaves no doubt that only federal laws made “in&para;<br>Pursuance” of the Constitution are supreme. See Gregory&para;<br>v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460 (1991) (“As long as it is&para;<br>acting within the powers granted it under the Constitution, Congress may impose its will on the States” (emphasis added)); Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 583–587 (2009)&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).&para;<br>Given this limitation, Congress cannot pre-empt a state&para;<br>law merely by promulgating a conflicting statute—the preempting statute must also be constitutional, both on its&para;<br>face and as applied. As relevant here, if Congress lacks&para;<br>authority to enact a law regulating a particular intrastate&para;<br>activity, it follows that Congress also lacks authority to&para;<br>pre-empt state laws regulating that activity. See U. S.&para;<br>Const., Amdt. 10 (“The powers not delegated to the United&para;<br>States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the&para;<br>States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to&para;<br>the people”).&para;<br>In this case, the Court concludes that “[s]ection&para;<br>14501(c)(1) . . . preempts the placard and parking provisions of the Port’s concession agreement.” Ante, at 12.&para;<br>Although respondents waived any argument that Congress lacks authority to regulate the placards and parking&para;<br>arrangements of drayage trucks using the port, I doubt&para;<br>that Congress has such authority. The Court has identified three categories of activity that Congress may&para;<br>regulate under the Commerce Clause: (1) the use of the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>channels of interstate commerce; (2) the instrumentalities&para;<br>of interstate commerce, and persons or things in interstate&para;<br>commerce; and (3) “activities having a substantial relation&para;<br>to interstate commerce . . . i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.” Lopez, supra, at&para;<br>558–559. Drayage trucks that carry cargo into and out of&para;<br>the Port of Los Angeles undoubtedly operate within the&para;<br>“channels of interstate commerce”—for that is what a port&para;<br>is. Congress can therefore regulate conduct taking place&para;<br>within the port. But it is doubtful whether Congress has&para;<br>the power to decide where a drayage truck should park&para;<br>once it has left the port or what kind of placard the truck&para;<br>should display while offsite. Even under the “substantial&para;<br>effects” test, which I have rejected as a “ ‘rootless and&para;<br>malleable standard’ at odds with the constitutional design,” Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 67 (dissenting opinion) (quoting United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598,&para;<br>627 (2000) (THOMAS, J., concurring)), it is difficult to say&para;<br>that placards and parking arrangements substantially affect interstate commerce. Congress made no findings&para;<br>indicating that offsite parking—conduct that falls within&para;<br>the scope of the States’ traditional police powers—&para;<br>substantially affects interstate commerce. And I doubt&para;<br>that it could. Nevertheless, because respondents did not&para;<br>preserve a constitutional challenge to the FAAAA and&para;<br>because I agree that the provisions in question have the&para;<br>“force and effect of law,” I join the Court’s opinion.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
