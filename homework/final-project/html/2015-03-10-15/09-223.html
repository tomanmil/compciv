COMMERCE&para;<br>ENERGY, INC., ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–223.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 22, 2010—Decided June 1, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Historically, all Ohio natural gas consumers purchased gas from a local&para;<br>distribution company (LDC), the public utility serving their geo&para;<br>graphic area. Today, however, consumers in Ohio’s major metropoli&para;<br>tan areas can alternatively contract with independent marketers&para;<br>(IMs) that compete with LDCs for retail sales of natural gas. Re&para;<br>spondents, mainly IMs offering to sell natural gas to Ohio consumers,&para;<br>sued petitioner Ohio Tax Commissioner (Commissioner) in federal&para;<br>court, alleging discriminatory taxation of IMs and their patrons in&para;<br>violation of the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses. They&para;<br>sought declaratory and injunctive relief invalidating three tax ex&para;<br>emptions Ohio grants exclusively to LDCs. The court initially held&para;<br>that respondents’ suit was not blocked by the Tax Injunction Act&para;<br>(TIA), which prohibits lower federal courts from restraining “the as&para;<br>sessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain,&para;<br>speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State,”&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §1341. Nevertheless, the court dismissed the suit based&para;<br>on the more embracive comity doctrine, which restrains federal&para;<br>courts from entertaining claims that risk disrupting state tax ad&para;<br>ministration, see Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v.&para;<br>McNary, 454 U. S. 100. The Sixth Circuit agreed with the District&para;<br>Court’s TIA holding, but reversed the court’s comity ruling, and re&para;<br>manded for adjudication of the merits. A footnote in Hibbs v. Winn,&para;<br>542 U. S. 88, 107, n. 9, the Court of Appeals believed, foreclosed an&para;<br>expansive reading of this Court’s comity precedents. The footnote&para;<br>stated that the Court “has relied upon ‘principles of comity’ to pre&para;<br>clude original federal-court jurisdiction only when plaintiffs have&para;<br>sought district-court aid in order to arrest or countermand state tax&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LEVIN v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>collection.” Respondents challenged only a few limited exemptions,&para;<br>the Sixth Circuit observed, therefore their success on the merits&para;<br>would not significantly intrude upon Ohio’s administration of its tax&para;<br>system.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Under the comity doctrine, a taxpayer’s complaint of allegedly&para;<br>discriminatory state taxation, even when framed as a request to in&para;<br>crease a competitor’s tax burden, must proceed originally in state&para;<br>court. Pp. 5–17.&para;<br>(a) The comity doctrine reflects a proper respect for the States and&para;<br>their institutions. E.g., Fair Assessment, 454 U. S., at 112. Comity’s&para;<br>constraint has particular force when lower federal courts are asked to&para;<br>pass on the constitutionality of state taxation of commercial activity.&para;<br>States rely chiefly on taxation to fund their governments’ operations,&para;<br>therefore their tax-enforcement methods should not be interfered&para;<br>with absent strong cause. See Dows v. Chicago, 11 Wall. 108, 110.&para;<br>The TIA was enacted specifically to constrain the issuance of federal&para;<br>injunctions in state-tax cases, see Fair Assessment, 454 U. S., at 129,&para;<br>and is best understood as but a partial codification of the federal re&para;<br>luctance to interfere with state taxation, National Private Truck&para;<br>Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm’n, 515 U. S. 582, 590. Pp. 5–8.&para;<br>(b) Hibbs does not restrict comity’s compass. Plaintiffs in Hibbs&para;<br>were Arizona taxpayers who challenged, as violative of the Estab&para;<br>lishment Clause, a tax credit that allegedly served to support paro&para;<br>chial schools. Their federal-court suit for declaratory and injunctive&para;<br>relief did not implicate in any way their own tax liability, and the re&para;<br>lief they sought would not deplete the State’s treasury. Rejecting&para;<br>Arizona’s plea that the TIA barred the suit, the Court found that the&para;<br>case was “not rationally distinguishable” from pathmarking civil&para;<br>rights controversies in which federal courts had entertained chal&para;<br>lenges to state tax credits without conceiving of the TIA as a jurisdic&para;<br>tional barrier. 542 U. S., at 93–94, 110–112. The Court also dis&para;<br>patched Arizona’s comity argument in the footnote that moved the&para;<br>Sixth Circuit here to reverse the District Court’s comity-based dis&para;<br>missal. Id., at 107, n. 9. Neither Hibbs nor any other decision of this&para;<br>Court, however, has considered the comity doctrine’s application to&para;<br>cases of the kind presented here. Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(c) Respondents contend that state action “selects [them] out for&para;<br>discriminatory treatment by subjecting [them] to taxes not imposed&para;<br>on others of the same class.” Hillsborough v. Cromwell, 326 U. S.&para;<br>620, 623. When economic legislation does not employ classifications&para;<br>subject to heightened scrutiny or impinge on fundamental rights,&para;<br>courts generally view constitutional challenges with the skepticism&para;<br>due respect for legislative choices demands. See, e.g., Hodel v. Indi&para;<br>ana, 452 U. S. 314, 331–332. And “in taxation, even more than in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classifica&para;<br>tion.” Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U. S. 83, 88. Of key importance,&para;<br>when unlawful discrimination infects tax classifications or other leg&para;<br>islative prescriptions, the Constitution simply calls for equal treat&para;<br>ment. How equality is accomplished—by extension or invalidation of&para;<br>the unequally distributed benefit or burden, or some other measure—&para;<br>is a matter on which the Constitution is silent. See, e.g., Heckler v.&para;<br>Mathews, 465 U. S. 728, 740. On finding unlawful discrimination,&para;<br>courts may attempt, within the bounds of their institutional compe&para;<br>tence, to implement what the legislature would have willed had it&para;<br>been apprised of the constitutional infirmity. E.g., id., at 739, n. 5.&para;<br>With the State’s legislative prerogative firmly in mind, this Court,&para;<br>upon finding impermissible discrimination in a State’s tax measure,&para;<br>generally remands the case, leaving the interim remedial choice to&para;<br>state courts. See, e.g., McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Bever&para;<br>ages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18,&para;<br>39–40. If lower federal courts were to consider the merits of suits al&para;<br>leging uneven state tax burdens, however, recourse to state court for&para;<br>the interim remedial determination would be unavailable, for federal&para;<br>tribunals lack authority to remand to state court an action initiated&para;<br>in federal court. Federal judges, moreover, are bound by the TIA,&para;<br>which generally precludes relief that would diminish state revenues,&para;<br>even if such relief is the remedy least disruptive of the state legisla&para;<br>ture’s design. These limitations on the remedial competence of lower&para;<br>federal courts counsel that they refrain from taking up cases of this&para;<br>genre, so long as state courts are equipped fairly to adjudicate them.&para;<br>Pp. 10–13.&para;<br>(d) Comity considerations warrant dismissal of respondents’ suit.&para;<br>If Ohio’s scheme is unconstitutional, the Ohio courts are better posi&para;<br>tioned to determine—unless and until the Ohio Legislature weighs&para;<br>in—how to comply with the mandate of equal treatment. See Davis&para;<br>v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 817–818. The unelabo&para;<br>rated comity footnote in Hibbs does not counsel otherwise. Hardly a&para;<br>run-of-the-mine tax case, Hibbs was essentially an attack on the allo&para;<br>cation of state resources for allegedly unconstitutional purposes.&para;<br>Plaintiffs there were third parties whose own tax liability was not a&para;<br>relevant factor. Here, by contrast, the very premise of respondents’&para;<br>suit is that they are taxed differently from LDCs. The Hibbs footnote&para;<br>is most sensibly read to affirm that, just as that case was a poor fit&para;<br>under the TIA, so it was a poor fit for comity. Respondents’ argu&para;<br>ment that this case is fit for federal-court adjudication because of the&para;<br>simplicity of the relief sought is unavailing. Even if their claims had&para;<br>merit, respondents would not be entitled to their preferred remedy.&para;<br>In Hibbs, however, if the District Court found the Arizona tax credit&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>LEVIN v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>impermissible under the Establishment Clause, only one remedy&para;<br>would redress the plaintiffs’ grievance: invalidation of the tax credit&para;<br>at issue. Pp. 13–15.&para;<br>(e) In sum, a confluence of factors in this case, absent in Hibbs,&para;<br>leads to the conclusion that the comity doctrine controls here. First,&para;<br>respondents seek federal-court review of commercial matters over&para;<br>which Ohio enjoys wide regulatory latitude; their suit does not in&para;<br>volve any fundamental right or classification that attracts heightened&para;<br>judicial scrutiny. Second, while respondents portray themselves as&para;<br>third-party challengers to an allegedly unconstitutional tax scheme,&para;<br>they are in fact seeking federal-court aid in an endeavor to improve&para;<br>their competitive position. Third, the Ohio courts are better posi&para;<br>tioned than their federal counterparts to correct any violation be&para;<br>cause they are more familiar with state legislative preferences and&para;<br>because the TIA does not constrain their remedial options. Individu&para;<br>ally, these considerations may not compel forbearance by federal dis&para;<br>trict courts; in combination, however, they demand deference to the&para;<br>state adjudicative process. Pp. 15–16.&para;<br>(f) The Sixth Circuit’s concern that application of the comity doc&para;<br>trine here would render the TIA effectively superfluous overlooks&para;<br>Congress’ aim, in enacting the TIA, to secure the comity doctrine&para;<br>against diminishment. Comity, moreover, is a prudential doctrine.&para;<br>“If the State voluntarily chooses to submit to a federal forum, princi&para;<br>ples of comity do not demand that the federal court force the case&para;<br>back into the State’s own system.” Ohio Bureau of Employment&para;<br>Servs. v. Hodory, 431 U. S. 471, 480. P. 16.&para;<br>(g) In light of the foregoing, the Court need not decide whether the&para;<br>TIA would itself block this suit. Pp. 16–17.&para;<br>&para;<br>554 F. 3d 1094, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

LEVIN, TAX COMMISSIONER OF OHIO,&para;<br>PETITIONER v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC., ET AL.&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>[June 1, 2010]&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>This case presents the question whether a federal dis­&para;<br>trict court may entertain a complaint of allegedly dis­&para;<br>criminatory state taxation, framed as a request to increase&para;<br>a commercial competitor’s tax burden. Relevant to our&para;<br>inquiry is the Tax Injunction Act (TIA or Act), 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1341, which prohibits lower federal courts from restrain­&para;<br>ing “the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under&para;<br>State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may&para;<br>be had in the courts of such State.” More embracive than&para;<br>the TIA, the comity doctrine applicable in state taxation&para;<br>cases restrains federal courts from entertaining claims for&para;<br>relief that risk disrupting state tax administration. See&para;<br>Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary, 454&para;<br>U. S. 100 (1981). The comity doctrine, we hold, requires&para;<br>that a claim of the kind here presented proceed originally&para;<br>in state court. In so ruling, we distinguish Hibbs v. Winn,&para;<br>542 U. S. 88 (2004), in which the Court held that neither&para;<br>the TIA nor the comity doctrine barred a federal district&para;<br>court from adjudicating an Establishment Clause chal­&para;<br>lenge to a state tax credit that allegedly funneled public&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LEVIN v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>funds to parochial schools.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Historically, all natural gas consumers in Ohio pur­&para;<br>chased gas from the public utility, known as a local distri­&para;<br>bution company (LDC), serving their geographic area. In&para;<br>addition to selling gas as a commodity, LDCs own and&para;<br>operate networks of distribution pipelines to transport and&para;<br>deliver gas to consumers. LDCs offer customers a single,&para;<br>bundled product comprising both gas and delivery.&para;<br>Today, consumers in Ohio’s major metropolitan areas&para;<br>can alternatively contract with an independent marketer&para;<br>(IM) that competes with LDCs for retail sales of natural&para;<br>gas. IMs do not own or operate distribution pipelines;&para;<br>they use LDCs’ pipelines. When a customer goes with an&para;<br>IM, therefore, she purchases two “unbundled” products:&para;<br>gas (from the IM) and delivery (from the LDC).&para;<br>Ohio treats LDCs and IMs differently for tax purposes.&para;<br>Relevant here, Ohio affords LDCs three tax exemptions&para;<br>that IMs do not receive. First, LDCs’ natural gas sales are&para;<br>exempt from sales and use taxes. Ohio Rev. Code Ann.&para;<br>§5739.02(B)(7) (Lexis Supp. 2010); §§5739.021(E), .023(G),&para;<br>.026(F) (Lexis 2008); §§5741.02(C), .021(A), .022(A),&para;<br>.023(A) (Lexis 2008). LDCs owe instead a gross receipts&para;<br>excise tax, §5727.24, which is lower than the sales and use&para;<br>taxes IMs must collect. Second, LDCs are not subject to&para;<br>the commercial activities tax imposed on IMs’ taxable&para;<br>gross receipts. §§5751.01(E)(2), .02 (Lexis Supp. 2010).&para;<br>Finally, Ohio law excludes inter-LDC natural gas sales&para;<br>from the gross receipts tax, which IMs must pay when&para;<br>they purchase gas from LDCs. §5727.33(B)(4) (Lexis&para;<br>2008).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Plaintiffs-respondents Commerce Energy, Inc., a Cali­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Plaintiff-respondent Gregory Slone is&para;<br>an Ohio citizen who has purchased natural gas from In­&para;<br>terstate Gas Supply since 1999. Alleging discriminatory&para;<br>taxation of IMs and their patrons in violation of the Com­&para;<br>merce and Equal Protection Clauses, Complaint ¶¶35–39,&para;<br>App. 11–13, respondents sued Richard A. Levin, Tax&para;<br>Commissioner of Ohio (Commissioner), in the U. S. Dis­&para;<br>trict Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Invoking&para;<br>that court’s federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1331, Complaint ¶6, App. 3, respondents sought declara­&para;<br>tory and injunctive relief invalidating the three tax ex­&para;<br>emptions LDCs enjoy and ordering the Commissioner to&para;<br>stop “recognizing and/or enforcing” the exemptions. Id., at&para;<br>20–21. Respondents named the Commissioner as sole&para;<br>defendant; they did not extend the litigation to include the&para;<br>LDCs whose tax burden their suit aimed to increase.1&para;<br>The District Court granted the Commissioner’s motion&para;<br>to dismiss the complaint. The TIA did not block the suit,&para;<br>the District Court initially held, because respondents, like&para;<br>the plaintiffs in Hibbs, were “third-parties challenging the&para;<br>constitutionality of [another’s] tax benefit,” and their&para;<br>requested relief “would not disrupt the flow of tax reve­&para;<br>nue” to the State. App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a.&para;<br>Nevertheless, the District Court “decline[d] to exercise&para;<br>jurisdiction” as a matter of comity. Id., at 32a. Ohio’s&para;<br>Legislature, the District Court observed, chose to provide&para;<br>the challenged tax exemptions to LDCs. Respondents&para;<br>requested relief that would “requir[e] Ohio to collect taxes&para;<br>which its legislature has not seen fit to impose.” Ibid.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 In moving to dismiss the complaint, the Commissioner urged, inter&para;<br>alia, that the LDCs were parties necessary to a just adjudication. See&para;<br>Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19. Ruling for the Commissioner on comity&para;<br>grounds, the District Court did not reach the question whether the&para;<br>LDCs were indispensable parties. App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a, 32a–33a.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>LEVIN v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). Such relief, the court&para;<br>said, would draw federal judges into “a particularly inap­&para;<br>propriate involvement in a state’s management of its fiscal&para;<br>operations.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). A&para;<br>state court, the District Court recognized, could extend the&para;<br>exemptions to IMs, but the TIA proscribed this revenue­&para;<br>reducing relief in federal court. “Where there would be&para;<br>two possible remedies,” the Court concluded, a federal&para;<br>court should not “impose its own judgment on the state&para;<br>legislature mandating which remedy is appropriate.” Ibid.&para;<br>The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit re­&para;<br>versed. 554 F. 3d 1094 (2009). While agreeing that the&para;<br>TIA did not bar respondents’ suit, the Sixth Circuit re­&para;<br>jected the District Court’s comity ruling. A footnote in&para;<br>Hibbs, the Court of Appeals believed, foreclosed the Dis­&para;<br>trict Court’s “expansive reading” of this Court’s comity&para;<br>precedents. 554 F. 3d, at 1098. The footnote stated that&para;<br>the Court “has relied upon ‘principles of comity’ to pre­&para;<br>clude original federal-court jurisdiction only when plain­&para;<br>tiffs have sought district-court aid in order to arrest or&para;<br>countermand state tax collection.” Hibbs, 542 U. S., at&para;<br>107, n. 9 (citation omitted). A broad view of the comity&para;<br>cases, the Sixth Circuit feared, would render the TIA&para;<br>“effectively superfluous,” and would “sub silentio overrule&para;<br>a series of important cases” presenting challenges to state&para;<br>tax measures. 554 F. 3d, at 1099, 1102 (citing Milliken v.&para;<br>Bradley, 433 U. S. 267 (1977); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S.&para;<br>388 (1983)); 554 F. 3d, at 1099–1100.&para;<br>In so ruling, the Sixth Circuit agreed with the Seventh&para;<br>and Ninth Circuits, which had similarly read Hibbs to rein&para;<br>in the comity doctrine, see Levy v. Pappas, 510 F. 3d 755&para;<br>(CA7 2007); Wilbur v. Locke, 423 F. 3d 1101 (CA9 2005),&para;<br>and it disagreed with the Fourth Circuit, which had con­&para;<br>cluded that Hibbs left comity doctrine untouched, see&para;<br>DIRECTV, Inc. v. Tolson, 513 F. 3d 119 (2008). Noting&para;<br>that respondents “challenge[d] only a few limited exemp­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tions,” and satisfied, therefore, that “[respondents’] suc­&para;<br>cess would not significantly intrude upon traditional&para;<br>matters of state taxation,” the Sixth Circuit remanded the&para;<br>case for adjudication of the merits. 554 F. 3d, at 1102.&para;<br>After unsuccessfully moving for rehearing en banc, App.&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert. 1a–2a, the Commissioner petitioned for&para;<br>certiorari. By then, the First Circuit had joined the Sixth,&para;<br>Seventh, and Ninth Circuits in holding that Hibbs sharply&para;<br>limited the scope of the comity bar. Coors Brewing Co. v.&para;<br>Méndez-Torres, 562 F. 3d 3 (2009). We granted the Com­&para;<br>missioner’s petition, 558 U. S. ___ (2009), to resolve the&para;<br>disagreement among the Circuits.&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Comity considerations, the Commissioner dominantly&para;<br>urges, preclude the exercise of lower federal-court adjudi­&para;<br>catory authority over this controversy, given that an ade­&para;<br>quate state-court forum is available to hear and decide&para;<br>respondents’ constitutional claims. We agree.&para;<br>The comity doctrine counsels lower federal courts to&para;<br>resist engagement in certain cases falling within their&para;<br>jurisdiction. The doctrine reflects&para;<br>“a proper respect for state functions, a recognition of&para;<br>the fact that the entire country is made up of a Union&para;<br>of separate state governments, and a continuance of&para;<br>the belief that the National Government will fare best&para;<br>if the States and their institutions are left free to per­&para;<br>form their separate functions in separate ways.” Fair&para;<br>Assessment, 454 U. S., at 112 (quoting Younger v.&para;<br>Harris, 401 U. S. 37, 44 (1971)).&para;<br>Comity’s constraint has particular force when lower fed­&para;<br>eral courts are asked to pass on the constitutionality of&para;<br>state taxation of commercial activity. For “[i]t is upon&para;<br>taxation that the several States chiefly rely to obtain the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>LEVIN v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>means to carry on their respective governments, and it is&para;<br>of the utmost importance to all of them that the modes&para;<br>adopted to enforce the taxes levied should be interfered&para;<br>with as little as possible.” Dows v. Chicago, 11 Wall. 108,&para;<br>110 (1871).&para;<br>“An examination of [our] decisions,” this Court wrote&para;<br>more than a century ago, “shows that a proper reluctance&para;<br>to interfere by prevention with the fiscal operations of the&para;<br>state governments has caused [us] to refrain from so doing&para;<br>in all cases where the Federal rights of the persons could&para;<br>otherwise be preserved unimpaired.” Boise Artesian Hot&para;<br>&amp; Cold Water Co. v. Boise City, 213 U. S. 276, 282 (1909).&para;<br>Accord Matthews v. Rodgers, 284 U. S. 521, 525–526&para;<br>(1932) (So long as the state remedy was “plain, adequate,&para;<br>and complete,” the “scrupulous regard for the rightful&para;<br>independence of state governments which should at all&para;<br>times actuate the federal courts, and a proper reluctance&para;<br>to interfere by injunction with their fiscal operations,&para;<br>require that such relief should be denied in every case&para;<br>where the asserted federal right may be preserved without&para;<br>it.”).2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Justice Brennan cogently explained, in practical terms, “the special&para;<br>reasons justifying the policy of federal noninterference with state tax&para;<br>collection”:&para;<br>“The procedures for mass assessment and collection of state taxes and&para;<br>for administration and adjudication of taxpayers’ disputes with tax&para;<br>officials are generally complex and necessarily designed to operate&para;<br>according to established rules. State tax agencies are organized to&para;<br>discharge their responsibilities in accordance with the state procedures.&para;<br>If federal declaratory relief were available to test state tax assess­&para;<br>ments, state tax administration might be thrown into disarray, and&para;<br>taxpayers might escape the ordinary procedural requirements imposed&para;<br>by state law. During the pendency of the federal suit the collection of&para;<br>revenue under the challenged law might be obstructed, with consequent&para;<br>damage to the State’s budget, and perhaps a shift to the State of the&para;<br>risk of taxpayer insolvency. Moreover, federal constitutional issues are&para;<br>likely to turn on questions of state tax law, which, like issues of state&para;<br>regulatory law, are more properly heard in the state courts.” Perez v.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Writing six years after the TIA’s&para;<br>passage, we emphasized the Act’s animating concerns: A&para;<br>“federal court of equity,” we reminded, “may in an appro­&para;<br>priate case refuse to give its special protection to private&para;<br>rights when the exercise of its jurisdiction would be preju­&para;<br>dicial to the public interest, [and] should stay its hand in&para;<br>the public interest when it reasonably appears that pri­&para;<br>vate interests will not suffer.” Id., at 297–298 (citations&para;<br>omitted). In enacting the TIA, we noted, “Congress recog­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Ledesma, 401 U. S. 82, 128, n. 17 (1971) (opinion concurring in part and&para;<br>dissenting in part).&para;<br>3 Two features of federal equity practice accounted for the courts’&para;<br>willingness to grant injunctive relief. First, the Court had held that,&para;<br>although “equity jurisdiction does not lie where there exists an ade­&para;<br>quate legal remedy[,] . . . the ‘adequate legal remedy’ must be one&para;<br>cognizable in federal court.” Fair Assessment, 454 U. S., at 129, n. 15&para;<br>(Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (emphasis in original). Second,&para;<br>federal courts, “construing strictly the requirement that the remedy&para;<br>available at law be ‘plain, adequate and complete,’ had frequently&para;<br>concluded that the procedures provided by the State were not ade­&para;<br>quate.” Ibid.

Id., at 299,&para;<br>301–302.4&para;<br>Decades later, in Fair Assessment, we ruled, based on&para;<br>comity concerns, that 42 U. S. C. §1983 does not permit&para;<br>federal courts to award damages in state taxation cases&para;<br>when state law provides an adequate remedy. 454 U. S.,&para;<br>at 116. We clarified in Fair Assessment that “the principle&para;<br>of comity which predated the Act was not restricted by its&para;<br>passage.” Id., at 110. And in National Private Truck&para;<br>Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm’n, 515 U. S. 582, 590&para;<br>(1995), we said, explicitly, that “the [TIA] may be best&para;<br>understood as but a partial codification of the federal&para;<br>reluctance to interfere with state taxation.”&para;<br>B&para;<br>Although our precedents affirm that the comity doctrine&para;<br>is more embracive than the TIA, several Courts of Ap­&para;<br>peals, including the Sixth Circuit in the instant case, have&para;<br>comprehended Hibbs to restrict comity’s compass. See&para;<br>supra, at 4–5. Hibbs, however, has a more modest reach.&para;<br>Plaintiffs in Hibbs were Arizona taxpayers who chal­&para;<br>lenged a state law authorizing tax credits for payments to&para;<br>organizations that disbursed scholarship grants to chil­&para;<br>dren attending private schools. 542 U.

As we&para;<br>explain below, however, the two cases differ markedly in&para;<br>ways bearing on the comity calculus. We have had no&para;<br>prior occasion to consider, under the comity doctrine, a&para;<br>taxpayer’s complaint about allegedly discriminatory state&para;<br>taxation framed as a request to increase a competitor’s tax&para;<br>burden. Now squarely presented with the question, we&para;<br>hold that comity precludes the exercise of original federal­&para;<br>court jurisdiction in cases of the kind presented here.&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondents complain that they are taxed unevenly in&para;<br>comparison to LDCs and their customers. Under either an&para;<br>equal protection or dormant Commerce Clause theory,&para;<br>respondents’ root objection is the same: State action,&para;<br>respondents contend, “selects [them] out for discrimina­&para;<br>tory treatment by subjecting [them] to taxes not imposed&para;<br>on others of the same class.” Hillsborough v. Cromwell,&para;<br>326 U. S. 620, 623 (1946) (equal protection); see Dennis v.&para;<br>Higgins, 498 U. S. 439, 447–448 (1991) (dormant Com­&para;<br>merce Clause).&para;<br>When economic legislation does not employ classifica­&para;<br>tions subject to heightened scrutiny or impinge on funda­&para;<br>mental rights,5 courts generally view constitutional chal­&para;<br>lenges with the skepticism due respect for legislative&para;<br>choices demands. See, e.g., Hodel v. Indiana, 452 U. S.&para;<br>314, 331–332 (1981); Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla.,&para;<br>Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 488–489 (1955).

With&para;<br>the State’s legislative prerogative firmly in mind, this&para;<br>Court, upon finding impermissible discrimination in a&para;<br>State’s allocation of benefits or burdens, generally re­&para;<br>mands the case, leaving the remedial choice in the hands&para;<br>of state authorities.

Assuming,&para;<br>arguendo, that respondents could prevail on the merits of&para;<br>the suit,9 the most obvious way to achieve parity would be&para;<br>to reduce respondents’ tax liability. Respondents did not&para;<br>seek such relief, for the TIA stands in the way of any&para;<br>decree that would “enjoin . . . collection of [a] tax under&para;<br>State law.” 28 U. S. C. §1341.10 A more ambitious solu­&para;<br>tion would reshape the relevant provisions of Ohio’s tax&para;<br>code. Were a federal court to essay such relief, however,&para;<br>the court would engage in the very interference in state&para;<br>taxation the comity doctrine aims to avoid. Cf. State&para;<br>Railroad Tax Cases, 92 U. S. 575, 614–615 (1876). Re­&para;<br>spondents’ requested remedy, an order invalidating the&para;<br>exemptions enjoyed by LDCs, App. 20–21, may be far from&para;<br>——————&para;<br>ings by adopting “narrowing constructions that might obviate the&para;<br>constitutional problem and intelligently mediate federal constitutional&para;<br>concerns and state interests.” Moore v.

Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803,&para;<br>817–818 (1989).11&para;<br>As earlier noted, our unelaborated footnote on comity in&para;<br>Hibbs, see supra, at 9, led the Sixth Circuit to conclude&para;<br>that we had diminished the force of that doctrine and&para;<br>made it inapplicable here. We intended no such conse­&para;<br>quential ruling. Hibbs was hardly a run-of-the-mine tax&para;<br>case. It was essentially an attack on the allocation of state&para;<br>resources for allegedly unconstitutional purposes. In&para;<br>Hibbs, the charge was state aid in alleged violation of the&para;<br>Establishment Clause; in other cases of the same genre,&para;<br>the attack was on state allocations to maintain racially&para;<br>segregated schools. See Hibbs, 542 U. S., at 93–94, 110–&para;<br>112. The plaintiffs in Hibbs were outsiders to the tax&para;<br>expenditure, “third parties” whose own tax liability was&para;<br>not a relevant factor. In this case, by contrast, the very&para;<br>premise of respondents’ suit is that they are taxed differ­&para;<br>ently from LDCs. Unlike the Hibbs plaintiffs, respondents&para;<br>do object to their own tax situation, measured by the&para;<br>allegedly more favorable treatment accorded LDCs.&para;<br>Hibbs held that the TIA did not preclude a federal chal­&para;<br>lenge by a third party who objected to a tax credit received&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 Respondents note that “[o]nce the district court grants the minimal&para;<br>relief requested—to disallow the exemptions—it will be up to the Ohio&para;<br>General Assembly to balance its own interests and determine how best&para;<br>to recast the tax laws, within constitutional restraints.” Brief for&para;<br>Respondents 41.

In context, we&para;<br>clarify, the Hibbs footnote comment on comity is most&para;<br>sensibly read to affirm that, just as the case was a poor fit&para;<br>under the TIA, so it was a poor fit for comity. The Court,&para;<br>in other words, did not deploy the footnote to recast the&para;<br>comity doctrine; it intended the note to convey only that&para;<br>the Establishment Clause-grounded case cleared both the&para;<br>TIA and comity hurdles.&para;<br>Respondents steadfastly maintain that this case is fit for&para;<br>federal-court adjudication because of the simplicity of the&para;<br>relief they seek, i.e., invalidation of exemptions accorded&para;<br>the LDCs. But as we just explained, even if respondents’&para;<br>Commerce Clause and equal protection claims had merit,&para;<br>respondents would have no entitlement to their preferred&para;<br>remedy. See supra, at 11. In Hibbs, however, if the Dis­&para;<br>trict Court found the Arizona tax credit impermissible&para;<br>under the Establishment Clause, only one remedy would&para;<br>redress the plaintiffs’ grievance: invalidation of the credit,&para;<br>which inevitably would increase the State’s tax receipts.&para;<br>Notably, redress in state court similarly would be limited&para;<br>to an order ending the allegedly impermissible state sup­&para;<br>port for parochial schools.12 Because state courts would&para;<br>have no greater leeway than federal courts to cure the&para;<br>alleged violation, nothing would be lost in the currency of&para;<br>comity or state autonomy by permitting the Hibbs suit to&para;<br>proceed in a federal forum.&para;<br>Comity, in sum, serves to ensure that “the National&para;<br>Government, anxious though it may be to vindicate and&para;<br>protect federal rights and federal interests, always en­&para;<br>deavors to do so in ways that will not unduly interfere&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 No refund suit (or other taxpayer mechanism) was open to the&para;<br>plaintiffs in Hibbs, who were financially disinterested “third parties”;&para;<br>they did not, therefore, improperly bypass any state procedure.

A confluence of factors in this case, absent in&para;<br>Hibbs, leads us to conclude that the comity doctrine con­&para;<br>trols here. First, respondents seek federal-court review of&para;<br>commercial matters over which Ohio enjoys wide regula­&para;<br>tory latitude; their suit does not involve any fundamental&para;<br>right or classification that attracts heightened judicial&para;<br>scrutiny. Second, while respondents portray themselves&para;<br>as third-party challengers to an allegedly unconstitutional&para;<br>tax scheme, they are in fact seeking federal-court aid in an&para;<br>endeavor to improve their competitive position. Third, the&para;<br>Ohio courts are better positioned than their federal coun­&para;<br>terparts to correct any violation because they are more&para;<br>familiar with state legislative preferences and because the&para;<br>TIA does not constrain their remedial options. Individu­&para;<br>ally, these considerations may not compel forbearance on&para;<br>the part of federal district courts; in combination, how­&para;<br>ever, they demand deference to the state adjudicative&para;<br>process.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The Sixth Circuit expressed concern that application of&para;<br>the comity doctrine here would render the TIA “effectively&para;<br>superfluous.” 554 F. 3d, at 1099; see id., at 1102.

See supra, at 7,&para;<br>and n. 3. By closing these loopholes, Congress secured the&para;<br>doctrine against diminishment. Comity, we further note,&para;<br>is a prudential doctrine. “If the State voluntarily chooses&para;<br>to submit to a federal forum, principles of comity do not&para;<br>demand that the federal court force the case back into the&para;<br>State’s own system.” Ohio Bureau of Employment Servs.&para;<br>v.

Winn, 542 U. S. 88&para;<br>(2004), seems to me still doubtful. Nothing in the Court’s&para;<br>opinion today expands Hibbs’ holding further, however,&para;<br>and on that understanding I join the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>1&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>_________________&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 09–223&para;<br>_________________&para;<br>&para;<br>RICHARD A. LEVIN, TAX COMMISSIONER OF OHIO,&para;<br>PETITIONER v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC., ET AL.&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>[June 1, 2010]&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins,&para;<br>concurring in the judgment.&para;<br>Although I, too, remain skeptical of the Court’s decision&para;<br>in Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88 (2004), see ante, at 1&para;<br>(KENNEDY, J., concurring), I agree that it is not necessary&para;<br>for us to revisit that decision to hold that this case belongs&para;<br>in state court. As the Court rightly concludes, Hibbs&para;<br>permits not just the application of comity principles to the&para;<br>litigation here, but also application of the Tax Injunction&para;<br>Act (TIA or Act), 28 U. S. C. §1341. See ante, at 17. I&para;<br>concur only in the judgment because where, as here, the&para;<br>same analysis supports both jurisdictional and nonjuris&para;<br>dictional grounds for dismissal (the TIA imposes a juris&para;<br>dictional bar, see, e.g., Hibbs, supra, at 104), the “proper&para;<br>course” under our precedents is to dismiss for lack of&para;<br>jurisdiction. Sinochem Int’l Co. v. Malaysia Int’l Shipping&para;<br>Corp., 549 U. S. 422, 435 (2007).&para;<br>Congress enacted the TIA’s prohibition on federal juris&para;<br>diction over certain cases involving state tax issues be&para;<br>cause federal courts had proved unable to exercise juris&para;<br>diction over such cases in the restrained manner that&para;<br>comity requires. See ante, at 7. As the Court explains,&para;<br>Congress’ decision to prohibit federal jurisdiction over&para;<br>cases within the Act’s scope did not disturb that jurisdic&para;<br>tion, or the comity principles that guide its exercise, in&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LEVIN v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>cases outside the Act’s purview. See ante, at 7−8; 12−17. I&para;<br>therefore agree with the Court that nothing in the Act or&para;<br>in Hibbs affects the application of comity principles to&para;<br>cases not covered by the Act. I disagree that this conclu&para;<br>sion moots the need for us to decide “whether the TIA&para;<br>would itself block th[is] suit.” Ante, at 16.&para;<br>The Court posits that because comity is available as a&para;<br>ground for dismissal even where the Act is not, the Act’s&para;<br>application to this case is irrelevant if comity would also&para;<br>support sending the case to state court. See ante, at&para;<br>16−17. The Court rests this analysis on our recent holding&para;<br>in Sinochem that a court may dismiss a case on a nonmer&para;<br>its ground such as comity without first resolving an ac&para;<br>companying jurisdictional issue. See ante, at 16−17 (citing&para;<br>549 U. S., at 425). The Court’s reliance on Sinochem is&para;<br>misplaced, however, because it confuses the fact that a&para;<br>court may do that with whether, and when, it should. As&para;<br>Sinochem itself explains, courts should not dismiss cases&para;<br>on nonjurisdictional grounds where “jurisdiction . . . ‘in&para;<br>volve[s] no arduous inquiry’ ” and deciding it would not&para;<br>substantially undermine “judicial economy.” 549 U. S., at&para;<br>436 (quoting Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U. S.&para;<br>574, 587−588 (1999)). In such circumstances, Sinochem&para;<br>reiterates the settled rule that “the proper course” is to&para;<br>dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. 549 U. S., at 436. That is&para;<br>the proper course here.&para;<br>The TIA prohibits federal courts from exercising juris&para;<br>diction over any action that would “suspend or restrain the&para;<br>assessment, levy or collection of [a] tax under State law.”&para;<br>§1341. As the Court appears to agree, see ante, at 17,&para;<br>n. 13, this is such a case even under the crabbed construc&para;<br>tion of the Act in Hibbs, which the Court accurately de&para;<br>scribes as holding only that the Act does “not preclude a&para;<br>federal challenge by a third party who object[s] to a tax&para;<br>credit received by others, but in no way object[s] to her&para;<br>own liability under any revenue-raising tax provision,”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>ante, at 14−15 (emphasizing that the “plaintiffs in Hibbs&para;<br>were outsiders to the tax expenditure, ‘third parties’&para;<br>whose own tax liability was not a relevant factor”). This is&para;<br>not such a case, because the respondents here are in no&para;<br>sense “outsiders” to the revenue-raising state-tax regime&para;<br>they ask the federal courts to restrain. Ibid.; see also&para;<br>Hibbs, supra, at 104. Respondents compete with entities&para;<br>who receive tax exemptions under that regime in provid&para;<br>ing services whose cost is affected by the exemptions.&para;<br>Respondents thus do object to their own liability in a very&para;<br>real and economically significant way: The liability the&para;<br>state tax regime imposes on them but not on their com&para;<br>petitors makes it more difficult for respondents to match&para;<br>or beat their competitors’ prices. The fact that they raise&para;<br>this objection through the expedient of contesting their&para;<br>competitors’ exemptions is plainly not enough to qualify&para;<br>them as Hibbs-like “outsiders” to the state revenue-raising&para;<br>scheme they wish to enjoin. If it were, application of the&para;<br>Act’s jurisdictional bar would depend on little more than a&para;<br>pleading game. The Act would bar a federal suit challeng&para;<br>ing a state tax scheme that requires the challenger to pay&para;<br>more taxes than his competitor if the challenger styles the&para;<br>suit as an objection to his own tax liability, but would not&para;<br>bar the suit if he styles it as an objection to the competi&para;<br>tor’s exemption.&para;<br>Because the Court appears to agree that even Hibbs&para;<br>does not endorse such a narrow view of the Act’s jurisdic&para;<br>tional bar, see ante, at 14−15, 17, n. 13, the “proper&para;<br>course” is to dismiss this suit under the statute and not&para;<br>reach the comity principles that the Court correctly holds&para;<br>independently support the same result, Sinochem, supra,&para;<br>at 436. Here, unlike in Sinochem, there is no economy to&para;<br>deciding the case on the nonjurisdictional ground: The&para;<br>same analysis that supports dismissal for comity reasons&para;<br>subjects this case to the Act’s jurisdictional prohibition,&para;<br>even as construed in Hibbs. Compare ante, at 5–17, with&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>LEVIN v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>Sinochem, supra, at 435–436 (approving dismissal of a&para;<br>suit on forum non conveniens grounds because dismissal&para;<br>on personal jurisdiction grounds would have required the&para;<br>“expense and delay” of a minitrial on forum contacts).&para;<br>Given this, I see only one explanation for the Court’s&para;<br>decision to dismiss on a “prudential” ground (comity), ante,&para;<br>at 16−17, rather than a mandatory one (jurisdiction): The&para;<br>Court wishes to leave the door open to doing in future&para;<br>cases what it did in Hibbs, namely, retain federal jurisdic&para;<br>tion over constitutional claims that the Court simply does&para;<br>not believe Congress should have entrusted to state judges&para;<br>under the Act, see 542 U. S., at 113–128 (KENNEDY, J.,&para;<br>dissenting).&para;<br>That is not a legitimate approach to this important area&para;<br>of the law, see ibid., and the Court’s assertion that our&para;<br>civil rights precedents require it does not withstand scru&para;<br>tiny. If it is indeed true (which it may have been in the&para;<br>civil rights cases) that federal jurisdiction is necessary to&para;<br>ensure a fair forum in which to litigate an allegedly un&para;<br>constitutional state tax scheme, the Act itself permits&para;<br>federal courts to retain jurisdiction on the ground that “a&para;<br>plain, speedy and efficient remedy” cannot be had in state&para;<br>court. §1341. But where, as here and in Hibbs, such a&para;<br>remedy can be had in state court, the Court should apply&para;<br>the Act as written. See 542 U. S., at 113–128 (KENNEDY,&para;<br>J., dissenting).&para;<br>Because I believe the Act forbids the approach to federal&para;<br>jurisdiction over state tax issues that the Court adopted in&para;<br>Hibbs, I would not decide this case in a way that leaves&para;<br>the door open to it even if the Court could find a doorstop&para;<br>that accords with, rather than upends, the settled princi&para;<br>ple that judges presented with multiple nonmerits&para;<br>grounds for dismissal should dismiss on jurisdictional&para;<br>grounds first. But the tension the Court’s decision creates&para;<br>with this settled principle should be enough to convince&para;<br>even those who do not share my view of the TIA that the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.
