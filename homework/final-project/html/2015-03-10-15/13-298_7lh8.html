In particular, the patent claims are designed to facilitate the&para;<br>exchange of financial obligations between two parties by using a&para;<br>computer system as a third-party intermediary. The patents in suit&para;<br>claim (1) a method for exchanging financial obligations, (2) a computer system configured to carry out the method for exchanging obligations, and (3) a computer-readable medium containing program code&para;<br>for performing the method of exchanging obligations.&para;<br>Respondents (together, CLS Bank), who operate a global network&para;<br>that facilitates currency transactions, filed suit against petitioner,&para;<br>arguing that the patent claims at issue are invalid, unenforceable, or&para;<br>not infringed. Petitioner counterclaimed, alleging infringement. After Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U. S. 593, was decided, the District Court&para;<br>held that all of the claims were ineligible for patent protection under&para;<br>35 U. S. C. §101 because they are directed to an abstract idea. The&para;<br>en banc Federal Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: Because the claims are drawn to a patent-ineligible abstract idea,&para;<br>they are not patent eligible under §101. Pp. 5–17.&para;<br>(a) The Court has long held that §101, which defines the subject&para;<br>matter eligible for patent protection, contains an implicit exception&para;<br>for ‘ “[l]aws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas.’ ” Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., 569 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___. In applying the §101 exception, this Court must distinguish&para;<br>patents that claim the “ ‘buildin[g] block[s]’ ” of human ingenuity,&para;<br>which are ineligible for patent protection, from those that integrate&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT’L&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>the building blocks into something more, see Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 566 U. S. ___, ___, thereby&para;<br>“transform[ing]” them into a patent-eligible invention, id., at ___.&para;<br>Pp. 5–6.&para;<br>(b) Using this framework, the Court must first determine whether&para;<br>the claims at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept. 566&para;<br>U. S., at ___. If so, the Court then asks whether the claim’s elements,&para;<br>considered both individually and “as an ordered combination,” “transform the nature of the claim” into a patent-eligible application. Id.,&para;<br>at ___. Pp. 7–17.&para;<br>(1) The claims at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept:&para;<br>the abstract idea of intermediated settlement. Under “the longstanding rule that ‘[a]n idea of itself is not patentable,’ ” Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 67, this Court has found ineligible patent claims&para;<br>involving an algorithm for converting binary-coded decimal numerals&para;<br>into pure binary form, id., at 71–72; a mathematical formula for computing “alarm limits” in a catalytic conversion process, Parker v.&para;<br>Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 594–595; and, most recently, a method for hedging against the financial risk of price fluctuations, Bilski, 561 U. S, at&para;<br>599. It follows from these cases, and Bilski in particular, that the&para;<br>claims at issue are directed to an abstract idea. On their face, they&para;<br>are drawn to the concept of intermediated settlement, i.e., the use of&para;<br>a third party to mitigate settlement risk. Like the risk hedging in&para;<br>Bilski, the concept of intermediated settlement is “ ‘a fundamental&para;<br>economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce,’ ” ibid.,&para;<br>and the use of a third-party intermediary (or “clearing house”) is a&para;<br>building block of the modern economy. Thus, intermediated settlement, like hedging, is an “abstract idea” beyond §101’s scope. Pp. 7–&para;<br>10.&para;<br>(2) Turning to the second step of Mayo’s framework: The method&para;<br>claims, which merely require generic computer implementation, fail&para;<br>to transform that abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.&para;<br>Pp. 10–16.&para;<br>(i) “Simply appending conventional steps, specified at a high&para;<br>level of generality,” to a method already “well known in the art” is not&para;<br>“enough” to supply the “ ‘inventive concept’ ” needed to make this&para;<br>transformation. Mayo, supra, at ___, ___. The introduction of a computer into the claims does not alter the analysis. Neither stating an&para;<br>abstract idea “while adding the words ‘apply it,’ ” Mayo, supra, at ___,&para;<br>nor limiting the use of an abstract idea “ ‘to a particular technological&para;<br>environment,’ ” Bilski, supra, at 610–611, is enough for patent eligibility. Stating an abstract idea while adding the words “apply it with&para;<br>a computer” simply combines those two steps, with the same deficient&para;<br>result. Wholly generic computer implementation is not generally the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>sort of “additional featur[e]” that provides any “practical assurance&para;<br>that the process is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize&para;<br>the [abstract idea] itself.” Mayo, supra, at ___. Pp. 11–14.&para;<br>(ii) Here, the representative method claim does no more than&para;<br>simply instruct the practitioner to implement the abstract idea of intermediated settlement on a generic computer. Taking the claim elements separately, the function performed by the computer at each&para;<br>step—creating and maintaining “shadow” accounts, obtaining data,&para;<br>adjusting account balances, and issuing automated instructions—is&para;<br>“[p]urely ‘conventional. ’ ” Mayo, 566 U. S., at ___. Considered “as an&para;<br>ordered combination,” these computer components “ad[d] nothing . . .&para;<br>that is not already present when the steps are considered separately.” Id., at ___. Viewed as a whole, these method claims simply recite&para;<br>the concept of intermediated settlement as performed by a generic&para;<br>computer. They do not, for example, purport to improve the functioning of the computer itself or effect an improvement in any other technology or technical field. An instruction to apply the abstract idea of&para;<br>intermediated settlement using some unspecified, generic computer&para;<br>is not “enough” to transform the abstract idea into a patent-eligible&para;<br>invention. Id., at ___. Pp. 14–16.&para;<br>(3) Because petitioner’s system and media claims add nothing of&para;<br>substance to the underlying abstract idea, they too are patent ineligible under §101. Petitioner conceded below that its media claims rise&para;<br>or fall with its method claims. And the system claims are no different in substance from the method claims. The method claims recite&para;<br>the abstract idea implemented on a generic computer; the system&para;<br>claims recite a handful of generic computer components configured to&para;<br>implement the same idea. This Court has long “warn[ed] . . . against”&para;<br>interpreting §101 “in ways that make patent eligibility ‘depend simply on the draftsman’s art.’ ” Mayo, supra, at ___. Holding that the&para;<br>system claims are patent eligible would have exactly that result.&para;<br>Pp. 16–17.&para;<br>717 F. 3d 1269, affirmed.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

See id., at 1274 (Lourie, J., concurring);&para;<br>id., at 1312–1313 (Rader, C. J., concurring in part and&para;<br>dissenting in part). With respect to petitioner’s system&para;<br>claims, the en banc Federal Circuit affirmed the District&para;<br>Court’s judgment by an equally divided vote. Id., at 1273.&para;<br>Writing for a five-member plurality, Judge Lourie concluded that all of the claims at issue are patent ineligible.&para;<br>In the plurality’s view, under this Court’s decision in Mayo&para;<br>Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc.,&para;<br>566 U.

The plurality concluded that&para;<br>petitioner’s claims “draw on the abstract idea of reducing&para;<br>settlement risk by effecting trades through a third-party&para;<br>intermediary,” and that the use of a computer to maintain,&para;<br>adjust, and reconcile shadow accounts added nothing of&para;<br>substance to that abstract idea. Ibid.&para;<br>Chief Judge Rader concurred in part and dissented in&para;<br>part. In a part of the opinion joined only by Judge Moore,&para;<br>Chief Judge Rader agreed with the plurality that petitioner’s method and media claims are drawn to an abstract&para;<br>idea.

It provides:&para;<br>“Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful&para;<br>process, machine, manufacture, or composition of&para;<br>matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof,&para;<br>may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions&para;<br>and requirements of this title.” 35 U.

Myriad Genetics, Inc., 569&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 11) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks and brackets omitted). We have interpreted §101&para;<br>and its predecessors in light of this exception for more&para;<br>than 150 years. Bilski, supra, at 601–602; see also&para;<br>O’Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, 112–120 (1854); Le Roy v.&para;<br>Tatham, 14 How. 156, 174–175 (1853).&para;<br>We have described the concern that drives this exclusionary principle as one of pre-emption. See, e.g., Bilski,&para;<br>supra, at 611–612 (upholding the patent “would pre-empt&para;<br>use of this approach in all fields, and would effectively&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT’L&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>grant a monopoly over an abstract idea”). Laws of nature,&para;<br>natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are “ ‘ “the basic&para;<br>tools of scientific and technological work.” ’ ” Myriad,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11). “[M]onopolization of those&para;<br>tools through the grant of a patent might tend to impede&para;<br>innovation more than it would tend to promote it,” thereby&para;<br>thwarting the primary object of the patent laws. Mayo,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2); see U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl.&para;<br>8 (Congress “shall have Power . . . To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts”). We have “repeatedly&para;<br>emphasized this . . . concern that patent law not inhibit&para;<br>further discovery by improperly tying up the future use&para;<br>of ” these building blocks of human ingenuity. Mayo,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (citing Morse, supra, at 113).&para;<br>At the same time, we tread carefully in construing this&para;<br>exclusionary principle lest it swallow all of patent law.&para;<br>Mayo, 566 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). At some level, “all&para;<br>inventions . . . embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply&para;<br>laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas.”&para;<br>Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2). Thus, an invention is not rendered ineligible for patent simply because it involves an&para;<br>abstract concept. See Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175,&para;<br>187 (1981). “[A]pplication[s]” of such concepts “ ‘to a new&para;<br>and useful end,’ ” we have said, remain eligible for patent&para;<br>protection. Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 67 (1972).&para;<br>Accordingly, in applying the §101 exception, we must&para;<br>distinguish between patents that claim the “ ‘buildin[g]&para;<br>block[s]’ ” of human ingenuity and those that integrate the&para;<br>building blocks into something more, Mayo, 566 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 20), thereby “transform[ing]” them into a&para;<br>patent-eligible invention, id., at ___ (slip op., at 3). The&para;<br>former “would risk disproportionately tying up the use of&para;<br>the underlying” ideas, id., at ___ (slip op., at 4), and are&para;<br>therefore ineligible for patent protection. The latter pose&para;<br>no comparable risk of pre-emption, and therefore remain&para;<br>eligible for the monopoly granted under our patent laws.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014) &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>III&para;<br>&para;<br>In Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 566 U. S. ___ (2012), we set forth a framework&para;<br>for distinguishing patents that claim laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas from those that claim&para;<br>patent-eligible applications of those concepts. First, we&para;<br>determine whether the claims at issue are directed to one&para;<br>of those patent-ineligible concepts. Id., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>8). If so, we then ask, “[w]hat else is there in the claims&para;<br>before us?” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9). To answer that&para;<br>question, we consider the elements of each claim both&para;<br>individually and “as an ordered combination” to determine&para;<br>whether the additional elements “transform the nature of&para;<br>the claim” into a patent-eligible application. Id., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 10, 9). We have described step two of this&para;<br>analysis as a search for an “ ‘inventive concept’ ”—i.e., an&para;<br>element or combination of elements that is “sufficient to&para;<br>ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly&para;<br>more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself.”&para;<br>Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3).3&para;<br>A&para;<br>We must first determine whether the claims at issue are&para;<br>directed to a patent-ineligible concept. We conclude that&para;<br>they are: These claims are drawn to the abstract idea of&para;<br>intermediated settlement.&para;<br>The “abstract ideas” category embodies “the longstanding rule that ‘[a]n idea of itself is not patentable.’ ” Benson, supra, at 67 (quoting Rubber-Tip Pencil Co. v. Howard, 20 Wall. 498, 507 (1874)); see also Le Roy, supra, at&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Because the approach we made explicit in Mayo considers all claim&para;<br>elements, both individually and in combination, it is consistent with the&para;<br>general rule that patent claims “must be considered as a whole.”&para;<br>Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 188 (1981); see Parker v. Flook, 437&para;<br>U. S. 584, 594 (1978) (“Our approach . . . is . . . not at all inconsistent&para;<br>with the view that a patent claim must be considered as a whole”).&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT’L&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>175 (“A principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth;&para;<br>an original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as&para;<br>no one can claim in either of them an exclusive right ”). In&para;<br>Benson, for example, this Court rejected as ineligible&para;<br>patent claims involving an algorithm for converting binarycoded decimal numerals into pure binary form, holding&para;<br>that the claimed patent was “in practical effect . . . a patent on the algorithm itself.” 409 U. S., at 71–72. And in&para;<br>Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 594–595 (1978), we held&para;<br>that a mathematical formula for computing “alarm limits”&para;<br>in a catalytic conversion process was also a patentineligible abstract idea.&para;<br>We most recently addressed the category of abstract&para;<br>ideas in Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U. S. 593 (2010). The claims&para;<br>at issue in Bilski described a method for hedging against&para;<br>the financial risk of price fluctuations. Claim 1 recited a&para;<br>series of steps for hedging risk, including: (1) initiating a&para;<br>series of financial transactions between providers and&para;<br>consumers of a commodity; (2) identifying market participants that have a counterrisk for the same commodity;&para;<br>and (3) initiating a series of transactions between those&para;<br>market participants and the commodity provider to balance the risk position of the first series of consumer transactions. Id., at 599. Claim 4 “pu[t] the concept articulated&para;<br>in claim 1 into a simple mathematical formula.” Ibid. The&para;<br>remaining claims were drawn to examples of hedging in&para;<br>commodities and energy markets.&para;<br>“[A]ll members of the Court agree[d]” that the patent at&para;<br>issue in Bilski claimed an “abstract idea.” Id., at 609; see&para;<br>also id., at 619 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).&para;<br>Specifically, the claims described “the basic concept of&para;<br>hedging, or protecting against risk.” Id., at 611. The&para;<br>Court explained that “ ‘[h]edging is a fundamental economic&para;<br>practice long prevalent in our system of commerce and&para;<br>taught in any introductory finance class.’ ” Ibid. “The&para;<br>concept of hedging” as recited by the claims in suit was&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>therefore a patent-ineligible “abstract idea, just like the&para;<br>algorithms at issue in Benson and Flook.” Ibid.&para;<br>It follows from our prior cases, and Bilski in particular,&para;<br>that the claims at issue here are directed to an abstract&para;<br>idea. Petitioner’s claims involve a method of exchanging&para;<br>financial obligations between two parties using a thirdparty intermediary to mitigate settlement risk. The intermediary creates and updates “shadow” records to reflect the value of each party’s actual accounts held at&para;<br>“exchange institutions,” thereby permitting only those&para;<br>transactions for which the parties have sufficient resources. At the end of each day, the intermediary issues&para;<br>irrevocable instructions to the exchange institutions to&para;<br>carry out the permitted transactions.&para;<br>On their face, the claims before us are drawn to the&para;<br>concept of intermediated settlement, i.e., the use of a third&para;<br>party to mitigate settlement risk. Like the risk hedging in&para;<br>Bilski, the concept of intermediated settlement is “ ‘a&para;<br>fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our&para;<br>system of commerce.’ ” Ibid.; see, e.g., Emery, Speculation&para;<br>on the Stock and Produce Exchanges of the United States,&para;<br>in 7 Studies in History, Economics and Public Law 283,&para;<br>346–356 (1896) (discussing the use of a “clearing-house” as&para;<br>an intermediary to reduce settlement risk). The use of a&para;<br>third-party intermediary (or “clearing house”) is also a&para;<br>building block of the modern economy. See, e.g., Yadav,&para;<br>The Problematic Case of Clearinghouses in Complex Markets, 101 Geo. L. J. 387, 406–412 (2013); J. Hull, Risk&para;<br>Management and Financial Institutions 103–104 (3d ed.&para;<br>2012). Thus, intermediated settlement, like hedging, is an&para;<br>“abstract idea” beyond the scope of §101.&para;<br>Petitioner acknowledges that its claims describe intermediated settlement, see Brief for Petitioner 4, but rejects&para;<br>the conclusion that its claims recite an “abstract idea.”&para;<br>Drawing on the presence of mathematical formulas in&para;<br>some of our abstract-ideas precedents, petitioner contends&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT’L&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that the abstract-ideas category is confined to “preexisting, fundamental truth[s]” that “ ‘exis[t ] in principle apart&para;<br>from any human action.’ ” Id., at 23, 26 (quoting Mayo,&para;<br>566 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8)).&para;<br>Bilski belies petitioner’s assertion. The concept of risk&para;<br>hedging we identified as an abstract idea in that case&para;<br>cannot be described as a “preexisting, fundamental truth.”&para;<br>The patent in Bilski simply involved a “series of steps&para;<br>instructing how to hedge risk.” 561 U. S., at 599. Although hedging is a longstanding commercial practice, id.,&para;<br>at 599, it is a method of organizing human activity, not a&para;<br>“truth” about the natural world “ ‘that has always existed,’ ”&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 22 (quoting Flook, supra, at 593,&para;<br>n. 15). One of the claims in Bilski reduced hedging to a&para;<br>mathematical formula, but the Court did not assign any&para;<br>special significance to that fact, much less the sort of&para;<br>talismanic significance petitioner claims. Instead, the&para;<br>Court grounded its conclusion that all of the claims at&para;<br>issue were abstract ideas in the understanding that risk&para;<br>hedging was a “ ‘fundamental economic practice.’ ” 561&para;<br>U. S., at 611.&para;<br>In any event, we need not labor to delimit the precise&para;<br>contours of the “abstract ideas” category in this case. It is&para;<br>enough to recognize that there is no meaningful distinction between the concept of risk hedging in Bilski and the&para;<br>concept of intermediated settlement at issue here. Both&para;<br>are squarely within the realm of “abstract ideas” as we&para;<br>have used that term.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Because the claims at issue are directed to the abstract&para;<br>idea of intermediated settlement, we turn to the second&para;<br>step in Mayo’s framework. We conclude that the method&para;<br>claims, which merely require generic computer implementation, fail to transform that abstract idea into a patenteligible invention.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>1&para;<br>At Mayo step two, we must examine the elements of the&para;<br>claim to determine whether it contains an “ ‘inventive&para;<br>concept’ ” sufficient to “transform” the claimed abstract&para;<br>idea into a patent-eligible application. 566 U. S., at ___,&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 3, 11). A claim that recites an abstract&para;<br>idea must include “additional features” to ensure “that the&para;<br>[claim] is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the [abstract idea].” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8–9). Mayo&para;<br>made clear that transformation into a patent-eligible&para;<br>application requires “more than simply stat[ing] the [abstract idea] while adding the words ‘apply it.’ ” Id., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 3).&para;<br>Mayo itself is instructive. The patents at issue in Mayo&para;<br>claimed a method for measuring metabolites in the bloodstream in order to calibrate the appropriate dosage of&para;<br>thiopurine drugs in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4–6). The respondent in that&para;<br>case contended that the claimed method was a patenteligible application of natural laws that describe the relationship between the concentration of certain metabolites&para;<br>and the likelihood that the drug dosage will be harmful or&para;<br>ineffective. But methods for determining metabolite levels&para;<br>were already “well known in the art,” and the process at&para;<br>issue amounted to “nothing significantly more than an&para;<br>instruction to doctors to apply the applicable laws when&para;<br>treating their patients.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).&para;<br>“Simply appending conventional steps, specified at a high&para;<br>level of generality,” was not “enough” to supply an “ ‘inventive concept.’ ” Id., at ___, ___, ___ (slip op., at 14, 8, 3).&para;<br>The introduction of a computer into the claims does not&para;<br>alter the analysis at Mayo step two. In Benson, for example, we considered a patent that claimed an algorithm&para;<br>implemented on “a general-purpose digital computer.” 409&para;<br>U. S., at 64. Because the algorithm was an abstract idea,&para;<br>see supra, at 8, the claim had to supply a “ ‘new and use-&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT’L&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ful’ ” application of the idea in order to be patent eligible.&para;<br>409 U. S., at 67. But the computer implementation did&para;<br>not supply the necessary inventive concept; the process&para;<br>could be “carried out in existing computers long in use.”&para;<br>Ibid. We accordingly “held that simply implementing a&para;<br>mathematical principle on a physical machine, namely a&para;<br>computer, [i]s not a patentable application of that principle.” Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (citing Benson,&para;<br>supra, at 64).&para;<br>Flook is to the same effect. There, we examined a computerized method for using a mathematical formula to&para;<br>adjust alarm limits for certain operating conditions (e.g.,&para;<br>temperature and pressure) that could signal inefficiency or&para;<br>danger in a catalytic conversion process. 437 U. S., at&para;<br>585–586. Once again, the formula itself was an abstract&para;<br>idea, see supra, at 8, and the computer implementation&para;<br>was purely conventional. 437 U. S., at 594 (noting that&para;<br>the “use of computers for ‘automatic monitoringalarming’ ” was “well known”). In holding that the process&para;<br>was patent ineligible, we rejected the argument that&para;<br>“implement[ing] a principle in some specific fashion” will&para;<br>“automatically fal[l] within the patentable subject matter&para;<br>of §101.” Id., at 593. Thus, “Flook stands for the proposition that the prohibition against patenting abstract ideas&para;<br>cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of&para;<br>[the idea] to a particular technological environment.”&para;<br>Bilski, 561 U. S., at 610–611 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>In Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, by contrast, we held that a&para;<br>computer-implemented process for curing rubber was&para;<br>patent eligible, but not because it involved a computer.&para;<br>The claim employed a “well-known” mathematical equation, but it used that equation in a process designed to&para;<br>solve a technological problem in “conventional industry&para;<br>practice.” Id., at 177, 178. The invention in Diehr used a&para;<br>“thermocouple” to record constant temperature measure-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ments inside the rubber mold—something “the industry&para;<br>ha[d] not been able to obtain.” Id., at 178, and n. 3. The&para;<br>temperature measurements were then fed into a computer,&para;<br>which repeatedly recalculated the remaining cure time&para;<br>by using the mathematical equation. Id., at 178–179.&para;<br>These additional steps, we recently explained, “transformed the process into an inventive application of the&para;<br>formula.” Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 12). In other&para;<br>words, the claims in Diehr were patent eligible because&para;<br>they improved an existing technological process, not because they were implemented on a computer.&para;<br>These cases demonstrate that the mere recitation of a&para;<br>generic computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible&para;<br>abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention. Stating an&para;<br>abstract idea “while adding the words ‘apply it’ ” is not&para;<br>enough for patent eligibility. Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 3). Nor is limiting the use of an abstract idea “ ‘to a&para;<br>particular technological environment.’ ” Bilski, supra, at&para;<br>610–611. Stating an abstract idea while adding the words&para;<br>“apply it with a computer” simply combines those two&para;<br>steps, with the same deficient result. Thus, if a patent’s&para;<br>recitation of a computer amounts to a mere instruction to&para;<br>“implemen[t]” an abstract idea “on . . . a computer,” Mayo,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16), that addition cannot impart&para;<br>patent eligibility. This conclusion accords with the preemption concern that undergirds our §101 jurisprudence.&para;<br>Given the ubiquity of computers, see 717 F. 3d, at 1286&para;<br>(Lourie, J., concurring), wholly generic computer implementation is not generally the sort of “additional featur[e]”&para;<br>that provides any “practical assurance that the process is&para;<br>more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the&para;<br>[abstract idea] itself.” Mayo, 566 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>8–9).&para;<br>The fact that a computer “necessarily exist[s] in the&para;<br>physical, rather than purely conceptual, realm,” Brief for&para;<br>Petitioner 39, is beside the point. There is no dispute that&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT’L&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>a computer is a tangible system (in §101 terms, a “machine”), or that many computer-implemented claims are&para;<br>formally addressed to patent-eligible subject matter. But&para;<br>if that were the end of the §101 inquiry, an applicant could&para;<br>claim any principle of the physical or social sciences by&para;<br>reciting a computer system configured to implement the&para;<br>relevant concept. Such a result would make the determination of patent eligibility “depend simply on the draftsman’s art,” Flook, supra, at 593, thereby eviscerating the&para;<br>rule that “ ‘[l]aws of nature, natural phenomena, and&para;<br>abstract ideas are not patentable,’ ” Myriad, 569 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 11).&para;<br>2&para;<br>The representative method claim in this case recites the&para;<br>following steps: (1) “creating” shadow records for each&para;<br>counterparty to a transaction; (2) “obtaining” start-of-day&para;<br>balances based on the parties’ real-world accounts at&para;<br>exchange institutions; (3) “adjusting” the shadow records&para;<br>as transactions are entered, allowing only those transactions for which the parties have sufficient resources; and&para;<br>(4) issuing irrevocable end-of-day instructions to the exchange institutions to carry out the permitted transactions. See n. 2, supra. Petitioner principally contends that&para;<br>the claims are patent eligible because these steps “require&para;<br>a substantial and meaningful role for the computer.” Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 48. As stipulated, the claimed method&para;<br>requires the use of a computer to create electronic records,&para;<br>track multiple transactions, and issue simultaneous instructions; in other words, “[t]he computer is itself the&para;<br>intermediary.” Ibid. (emphasis deleted).&para;<br>In light of the foregoing, see supra, at 11–14, the relevant question is whether the claims here do more than&para;<br>simply instruct the practitioner to implement the abstract&para;<br>idea of intermediated settlement on a generic computer.&para;<br>They do not.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Taking the claim elements separately, the function&para;<br>performed by the computer at each step of the process is&para;<br>“[p]urely conventional.” Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>10) (internal quotation marks omitted). Using a computer&para;<br>to create and maintain “shadow” accounts amounts to&para;<br>electronic recordkeeping—one of the most basic functions&para;<br>of a computer. See, e.g., Benson, 409 U. S., at 65 (noting&para;<br>that a computer “operates . . . upon both new and previously stored data”). The same is true with respect to the&para;<br>use of a computer to obtain data, adjust account balances,&para;<br>and issue automated instructions; all of these computer&para;<br>functions are “well-understood, routine, conventional&para;<br>activit[ies]” previously known to the industry. Mayo, 566&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). In short, each step does no&para;<br>more than require a generic computer to perform generic&para;<br>computer functions.&para;<br>Considered “as an ordered combination,” the computer&para;<br>components of petitioner’s method “ad[d] nothing . . . that&para;<br>is not already present when the steps are considered&para;<br>separately.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10). Viewed as a&para;<br>whole, petitioner’s method claims simply recite the concept&para;<br>of intermediated settlement as performed by a generic&para;<br>computer. See 717 F. 3d, at 1286 (Lourie, J., concurring)&para;<br>(noting that the representative method claim “lacks any&para;<br>express language to define the computer’s participation”).&para;<br>The method claims do not, for example, purport to improve&para;<br>the functioning of the computer itself. See ibid. (“There is&para;<br>no specific or limiting recitation of . . . improved computer&para;<br>technology . . . ”); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae&para;<br>28–30. Nor do they effect an improvement in any other&para;<br>technology or technical field. See, e.g., Diehr, 450 U. S., at&para;<br>177–178. Instead, the claims at issue amount to “nothing&para;<br>significantly more” than an instruction to apply the abstract idea of intermediated settlement using some unspecified, generic computer. Mayo, 566 U. S., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 10). Under our precedents, that is not “enough” to&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>ALICE CORP. v. CLS BANK INT’L&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>transform an abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.&para;<br>Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8).&para;<br>C&para;<br>Petitioner’s claims to a computer system and a computerreadable medium fail for substantially the same reasons. Petitioner conceded below that its media claims rise&para;<br>or fall with its method claims. En Banc Response Brief for&para;<br>Defendant-Appellant in No. 11–1301 (CA Fed.) p. 50, n. 3.&para;<br>As to its system claims, petitioner emphasizes that those&para;<br>claims recite “specific hardware” configured to perform&para;<br>“specific computerized functions.” Brief for Petitioner 53.&para;<br>But what petitioner characterizes as specific hardware—a&para;<br>“data processing system” with a “communications controller” and “data storage unit,” for example, see App. 954,&para;<br>958, 1257—is purely functional and generic. Nearly every&para;<br>computer will include a “communications controller” and&para;<br>“data storage unit” capable of performing the basic calculation, storage, and transmission functions required by the&para;<br>method claims. See 717 F. 3d, at 1290 (Lourie, J., concurring). As a result, none of the hardware recited by the&para;<br>system claims “offers a meaningful limitation beyond&para;<br>generally linking ‘the use of the [method] to a particular&para;<br>technological environment,’ that is, implementation via&para;<br>computers.” Id., at 1291 (quoting Bilski, 561 U. S., at&para;<br>610–611).&para;<br>Put another way, the system claims are no different&para;<br>from the method claims in substance. The method claims&para;<br>recite the abstract idea implemented on a generic computer;&para;<br>the system claims recite a handful of generic computer&para;<br>components configured to implement the same idea. This&para;<br>Court has long “warn[ed] . . . against” interpreting §101&para;<br>“in ways that make patent eligibility ‘depend simply on&para;<br>the draftsman’s art.’ ” Mayo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3)&para;<br>(quoting Flook, 437 U.

Holding that the system claims are&para;<br>patent eligible would have exactly that result.&para;<br>Because petitioner’s system and media claims add nothing of substance to the underlying abstract idea, we hold&para;<br>that they too are patent ineligible under §101.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals for the Federal Circuit is affirmed.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.
