ANTHONY CARDELL &para;<br>&para;<br>HAYNES &para;<br>&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED&para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 09–273.&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided February 22, 2010 &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>This case presents the question whether any decision of&para;<br>this Court “clearly establishes” that a judge, in ruling on&para;<br>an objection to a peremptory challenge under Batson v.&para;<br>Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), must reject a demeanor&para;<br>based explanation for the challenge unless the judge per&para;<br>sonally observed and recalls the aspect of the prospective&para;<br>juror’s demeanor on which the explanation is based. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals appears to have concluded that either&para;<br>Batson itself or Snyder v. Louisiana, 552 U. S. 472 (2008),&para;<br>clearly established such a rule, but the Court of Appeals&para;<br>read far too much into those decisions, and its holding, if&para;<br>allowed to stand, would have important implications. We&para;<br>therefore grant the petition for certiorari, grant respon&para;<br>dent’s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and reverse&para;<br>the judgment of the Court of Appeals.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Respondent was tried in a Texas state court for the&para;<br>murder of a police officer, and the State sought the death&para;<br>penalty. During voir dire, two judges presided at different&para;<br>stages. Judge Harper presided when the attorneys ques&para;<br>tioned the prospective jurors individually, but Judge&para;<br>Wallace took over when peremptory challenges were exer&para;<br>cised. When the prosecutor struck an African-American&para;<br>juror named Owens, respondent’s attorney raised a Batson&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>THALER v. HAYNES&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>objection. Judge Wallace determined that respondent had&para;<br>made out a prima facie case under Batson, and the prose&para;<br>cutor then offered a race-neutral explanation that was&para;<br>based on Owens’ demeanor during individual questioning.&para;<br>Specifically, the prosecutor asserted that Owens’ de&para;<br>meanor had been “somewhat humorous” and not “serious”&para;<br>and that her “body language” had belied her “true feeling.”&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 187. Based on his observations of&para;<br>Owens during questioning by respondent’s attorney, the&para;<br>prosecutor stated, he believed that she “had a predisposi&para;<br>tion” and would not look at the possibility of imposing a&para;<br>death sentence “in a neutral fashion.” Id., at 188. Re&para;<br>spondent’s attorney did not dispute the prosecutor’s char&para;<br>acterization of Owens’ demeanor, but he asserted that her&para;<br>answers on the jury questionnaire “show[ed] that she was&para;<br>a juror who [was] leaning towards the State’s case.” Ibid.&para;<br>After considering the prosecutor’s explanation and the&para;<br>arguments of defense counsel, Judge Wallace stated that&para;<br>the prosecutor’s reason for the strike was “race-neutral”&para;<br>and denied the Batson objection without further explana&para;<br>tion. Id., at 189.&para;<br>The case proceeded to trial, respondent was convicted&para;<br>and sentenced to death, and the Texas Court of Criminal&para;<br>Appeals affirmed the conviction. Rejecting respondent’s&para;<br>argument that “a trial judge who did not witness the&para;<br>actual voir dire cannot, as a matter of law, fairly evaluate&para;<br>a Batson challenge,” id., at 173, the Court of Criminal&para;<br>Appeals wrote:&para;<br>“There are many factors which a trial judge—even one&para;<br>who did not preside over the voir dire examinations—&para;<br>can consider in determining whether the opponent of&para;<br>the peremptory strikes has met his burden. These in&para;<br>clude the nature and strength of the parties’ argu&para;<br>ments during the Batson hearing and the attorneys’&para;<br>demeanor and credibility. And, when necessary, a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>trial judge who has not witnessed the voir dire may&para;<br>refer to the record,” id., at 173–174 (footnote omitted).&para;<br>With respect to the strike of juror Owens, the court held&para;<br>that Judge Wallace’s acceptance of the prosecutor’s expla&para;<br>nation was not clearly erroneous and noted that “[t]he&para;<br>record does reflect that Owens was congenial and easygo&para;<br>ing during voir dire and that her attitude was less formal&para;<br>than that of other veniremembers.” Id., at 172. This&para;<br>Court denied respondent’s petition for a writ of certiorari.&para;<br>Haynes v. Texas, 535 U. S. 999 (2002).&para;<br>After the Texas courts denied his application for state&para;<br>habeas relief, respondent filed a federal habeas petition.&para;<br>The District Court denied the petition and observed that&para;<br>this Court had never held that the deference to state-court&para;<br>factual determinations that is mandated by the federal&para;<br>habeas statute is inapplicable when the judge ruling on a&para;<br>Batson objection did not observe the jury selection. App.&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert. 80, n. 10.&para;<br>A panel of the Court of Appeals granted a certificate of&para;<br>appealability with respect to respondent’s Batson objec&para;<br>tions concerning Owens and one other prospective juror.&para;<br>Haynes v. Quarterman, 526 F. 3d 189, 202 (CA5 2008). In&para;<br>its opinion granting the certificate, the panel discussed&para;<br>our opinion in Snyder at length and then concluded:&para;<br>“Under Snyder’s application of Batson, . . . an appel&para;<br>late court applying Batson arguably should find clear&para;<br>error when the record reflects that the trial court was&para;<br>not able to verify the aspect of the juror’s demeanor&para;<br>upon which the prosecutor based his or her peremp&para;<br>tory challenge.” 526 F. 3d, at 199.&para;<br>When the same panel later ruled on the merits of re&para;<br>spondent’s Batson claim regarding juror Owens,1 the court&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Because the panel held that the strike of Owens violated Batson, the&para;<br>panel did not rule on the legitimacy of the other strike as to which a&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>THALER v. HAYNES&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>adopted the rule that it had previously termed “ar&para;<br>guabl[e].” See 526 F. 3d, at 199; Haynes v. Quarterman,&para;<br>561 F. 3d 535, 541 (CA5 2009). The court concluded that&para;<br>the decisions of the state courts were not owed “AEDPA&para;<br>deference” in this case “because the state courts engaged&para;<br>in pure appellate fact-finding for an issue that turns en&para;<br>tirely on demeanor.” Ibid. The court then held that&para;<br>“no court, including ours, can now engage in a proper&para;<br>adjudication of the defendant’s demeanor-based Bat&para;<br>son challenge as to prospective juror Owens because&para;<br>we will be relying solely on a paper record and would&para;<br>thereby contravene Batson and its clearly-established&para;<br>‘factual inquiry’ requirement. See, e.g., Snyder, [552&para;<br>U. S., at 477]; Batson, [476 U. S., at 95].” Ibid. (foot&para;<br>note omitted).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Respondent cannot obtain federal habeas relief under 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) unless he can show that the decision&para;<br>of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals “was contrary to,&para;<br>or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab&para;<br>lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.”&para;<br>A legal principle is “clearly established” within the mean&para;<br>ing of this provision only when it is embodied in a holding&para;<br>of this Court. See Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70, 74&para;<br>(2006); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000).&para;<br>Under §2254(d)(1), a habeas petitioner may obtain relief&para;<br>(1) “if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to&para;<br>that reached by this Court on a question of law or if the&para;<br>state court decides a case differently than this Court has&para;<br>on a set of materially indistinguishable facts”; or (2) “if the&para;<br>state court identifies the correct governing legal principle&para;<br>from this Court’s decisions but unreasonably applies that&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>certificate of appealability had been issued.

S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>principle to the facts of the prisoner’s case.” Id., at 413.&para;<br>III&para;<br>In holding that respondent is entitled to a new trial, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals cited two decisions of this Court, Batson&para;<br>and Snyder, but neither of these cases held that a de&para;<br>meanor-based explanation for a peremptory challenge&para;<br>must be rejected unless the judge personally observed&para;<br>and recalls the relevant aspect of the prospective juror’s&para;<br>demeanor.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals appears to have concluded that&para;<br>Batson supports its decision because Batson requires a&para;<br>judge ruling on an objection to a peremptory challenge to&para;<br>“ ‘undertake “a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial&para;<br>and direct evidence of intent as may be available.” ’ ” 561&para;<br>F. 3d, at 540 (quoting Batson, 476 U. S., at 93, in turn&para;<br>quoting Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Devel&para;<br>opment Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266 (1977)). This general&para;<br>requirement, however, did not clearly establish the rule on&para;<br>which the Court of Appeals’ decision rests. Batson noted&para;<br>the need for a judge ruling on an objection to a peremptory&para;<br>challenge to “tak[e] into account all possible explanatory&para;<br>factors in the particular case,” 476 U. S., at 95 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). See also Miller-El v. Dretke,&para;<br>545 U. S. 231, 239 (2005); Johnson v. California, 545 U. S.&para;<br>162, 170 (2005). Thus, where the explanation for a per&para;<br>emptory challenge is based on a prospective juror’s de&para;<br>meanor, the judge should take into account, among other&para;<br>things, any observations of the juror that the judge was&para;<br>able to make during the voir dire. But Batson plainly did&para;<br>not go further and hold that a demeanor-based explana&para;<br>tion must be rejected if the judge did not observe or cannot&para;<br>recall the juror’s demeanor.&para;<br>Nor did we establish such a rule in Snyder.2 In that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Even&para;<br>&para;<br>if Snyder did alter or add to Batson’s rule (as the Court of&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>THALER v. HAYNES&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>case, the judge who presided over the voir dire also ruled&para;<br>on the Batson objections, and thus we had no occasion to&para;<br>consider how Batson applies when different judges preside&para;<br>over these two stages of the jury selection process. Sny&para;<br>der, 552 U. S., at 475–478. The part of Snyder on which&para;<br>the Court of Appeals relied concerned a very different&para;<br>problem. The prosecutor in that case asserted that he had&para;<br>exercised a peremptory challenge for two reasons, one of&para;<br>which was based on demeanor (i.e., that the juror had&para;<br>appeared to be nervous), and the trial judge overruled the&para;<br>Batson objection without explanation. 552 U. S., at 478–&para;<br>479. We concluded that the record refuted the explanation&para;<br>that was not based on demeanor and, in light of the par&para;<br>ticular circumstances of the case, we held that the per&para;<br>emptory challenge could not be sustained on the de&para;<br>meanor-based ground, which might not have figured in the&para;<br>trial judge’s unexplained ruling. Id., at 479–486. Nothing&para;<br>in this analysis supports the blanket rule on which the&para;<br>decision below appears to rest.&para;<br>The opinion in Snyder did note that when the explana&para;<br>tion for a peremptory challenge “invoke[s] a juror’s de&para;<br>meanor,” the trial judge’s “first hand observations” are of&para;<br>great importance. Id., at 477. And in explaining why we&para;<br>could not assume that the trial judge had credited the&para;<br>claim that the juror was nervous, we noted that, because&para;<br>the peremptory challenge was not exercised until some&para;<br>time after the juror was questioned, the trial judge might&para;<br>not have recalled the juror’s demeanor. Id., at 479. These&para;<br>observations do not suggest that, in the absence of a per&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Appeals seems to have concluded), Snyder could not have constituted&para;<br>“clearly established Federal law as determined by” this Court for&para;<br>purposes of respondent’s habeas petition because we decided Snyder&para;<br>nearly six years after his conviction became final and more than six&para;<br>years after the relevant state-court decision. See Williams v. Taylor,&para;<br>529 U. S. 362, 390 (2000) (opinion for the Court by STEVENS, J.); id., at&para;<br>412 (opinion for the Court by O’Connor, J.).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>sonal recollection of the juror’s demeanor, the judge could&para;<br>not have accepted the prosecutor’s explanation. Indeed,&para;<br>Snyder quoted the observation in Hernandez v. New York,&para;<br>500 U. S. 352, 365 (1991) (plurality opinion), that the best&para;<br>evidence of the intent of the attorney exercising a strike is&para;<br>often that attorney’s demeanor. See 552 U. S., at 477.&para;<br>Accordingly, we hold that no decision of this Court&para;<br>clearly establishes the categorical rule on which the Court&para;<br>of Appeals appears to have relied, and we therefore re&para;<br>verse the judgment and remand the case for proceedings&para;<br>consistent with this opinion. Our decision does not man&para;<br>date the rejection of respondent’s Batson claim regarding&para;<br>juror Owens. On remand, the Court of Appeals may con&para;<br>sider whether the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals’ de&para;<br>termination may be overcome under the federal habeas&para;<br>statute’s standard for reviewing a state court’s resolution&para;<br>of questions of fact.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
