MARVIN VERNIS SMITH&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 13–946&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided October 6, 2014&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>When a state prisoner seeks federal habeas relief on the&para;<br>ground that a state court, in adjudicating a claim on the&para;<br>merits, misapplied federal law, a federal court may grant&para;<br>relief only if the state court’s decision was “contrary to, or&para;<br>involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court&para;<br>of the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). We have&para;<br>emphasized, time and again, that the Antiterrorism and&para;<br>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat.&para;<br>1214, prohibits the federal courts of appeals from relying on their own precedent to conclude that a particular&para;<br>constitutional principle is “clearly established.” See, e.g.,&para;<br>Marshall v. Rodgers, 569 U. S. __, __ (2013) (per curiam)&para;<br>(slip op. at 6). Because the Ninth Circuit failed to comply&para;<br>with this rule, we reverse its decision granting habeas&para;<br>relief to respondent Marvin Smith.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Respondent was arrested for the murder of his wife,&para;<br>Minnie Smith. On December 15, 2005, Mrs. Smith was&para;<br>found dead in the home she shared with respondent, and&para;<br>it was determined that she was killed by a massive blow to&para;<br>the head from a fireplace log roller. The home appeared to&para;<br>have been ransacked, and valuable jewelry was missing.&para;<br>The State charged respondent with first-degree murder&para;<br>and offered substantial incriminating evidence at trial.&para;<br>The prosecution presented evidence that respondent “was&para;<br>unfaithful to his wife for many years, that his wife was&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LOPEZ v. SMITH&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>threatening to divorce him, and that he told one of his&para;<br>former employees . . . that the ‘only way’ he or his wife&para;<br>would get out of their marriage was ‘to die,’ because he&para;<br>was ‘not going to give [Mrs. Smith] half of what [he] got so&para;<br>some other man can live off of it.’ ” 731 F. 3d 859, 862–863&para;<br>(CA9 2013) (second alteration in original). Respondent’s&para;<br>DNA was also found on the murder weapon, pieces of duct&para;<br>tape found near the body, and a burned matchstick that&para;<br>was found in the bedroom and that may have been used to&para;<br>inflict burns on the body. See id., at 863; see also People v.&para;<br>Smith, 2010 WL 4975500, *1–*2 (Cal. App., Dec. 8, 2010).&para;<br>The missing jewelry was discovered in the trunk of respondent’s car, wrapped in duct tape from the same roll&para;<br>that had provided the pieces found near the body. See 731&para;<br>F. 3d, at 863. Respondent’s DNA was found on the duct&para;<br>tape in his trunk. See Smith, 2010 WL 4975500, at *2. In&para;<br>addition, a criminologist testified that the ransacking of&para;<br>the Smiths’ home appeared to have been staged. See 731&para;<br>F. 3d, at 863.&para;<br>Respondent defended in part on the basis that he could&para;<br>not have delivered the fatal blow due to rotator cuff surgery several weeks before the murder. See ibid. (He&para;<br>mounted this defense despite the fact that police had&para;<br>observed him wielding a 6-foot-long 2 by 4 to pry something out of a concrete slab at a construction site the week&para;<br>after the murder. See Smith, 2010 WL 4975500, at *1.)&para;<br>The defense also suggested that one of respondent’s former&para;<br>employees had committed the crime to obtain money to&para;<br>pay a debt he owed respondent. See 731 F. 3d, at 863.&para;<br>At the close of evidence, the prosecution requested an&para;<br>aiding-and-abetting instruction, and the trial court agreed&para;<br>to give such an instruction. During closing argument, the&para;<br>prosecutor contended that respondent was physically able&para;<br>to wield the log roller that had killed Mrs. Smith, but he&para;<br>also informed the jury that, even if respondent had not&para;<br>delivered the fatal blow, he could still be convicted on an&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>aiding-and-abetting theory. See id., at 864. The jury&para;<br>convicted respondent of first-degree murder without specifying which theory of guilt it adopted.&para;<br>After a series of state-court proceedings not relevant&para;<br>here, the California Court of Appeal affirmed respondent’s&para;<br>conviction. The state court rejected respondent’s assertion&para;<br>that he had inadequate notice of the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory. The court explained that “ ‘an accusatory pleading charging a defendant with murder need not specify the theory of murder on&para;<br>which the prosecution intends to rely,’ ” and noted that the&para;<br>“information charged defendant with murder in compliance with the governing statutes.” Smith, 2010 WL&para;<br>4975500, at *6–*7. Furthermore, the court held that “even&para;<br>if this case required greater specificity concerning the&para;<br>basis of defendant’s liability, the evidence presented at his&para;<br>preliminary examination provided it.” Id., at *7. The&para;<br>upshot was that “the information and preliminary examination testimony adequately notified defendant he could&para;<br>be prosecuted for murder as an aider and abettor.” Id., at&para;<br>*8. The California Supreme Court denied respondent’s&para;<br>petition for review.&para;<br>Respondent filed a petition for habeas relief with the&para;<br>United States District Court for the Central District of&para;<br>California. The Magistrate Judge recommended granting&para;<br>relief, and the District Court summarily adopted the&para;<br>Magistrate Judge’s recommendation.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit affirmed. The court acknowledged&para;<br>that the “information charging [respondent] with firstdegree murder was initially sufficient to put him on notice&para;<br>that he could be convicted either as a principal or as an&para;<br>aider-and-abettor,” because under California law “aiding&para;<br>and abetting a crime is the same substantive offense as&para;<br>perpetrating the crime.” 731 F. 3d, at 868. But the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit nevertheless concluded that respondent’s Sixth&para;<br>Amendment and due process right to notice had been&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>LOPEZ v. SMITH&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>violated because it believed the prosecution (until it requested the aiding-and-abetting jury instruction) had tried&para;<br>the case only on the theory that respondent himself had&para;<br>delivered the fatal blow. See id., at 869.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit did not purport to identify any case in&para;<br>which we have found notice constitutionally inadequate&para;<br>because, although the defendant was initially adequately&para;<br>apprised of the offense against him, the prosecutor focused&para;<br>at trial on one potential theory of liability at the expense&para;<br>of another. Rather, it found the instant case to be “indistinguishable from” the Ninth Circuit’s own decision in&para;<br>Sheppard v. Rees, 909 F. 2d 1234 (1989), which the court&para;<br>thought “faithfully applied the principles enunciated by&para;<br>the Supreme Court.” 731 F. 3d, at 868. The court also&para;<br>rejected, as an “unreasonable determination of the facts,”&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2), the California Court of Appeal’s&para;<br>conclusion that preliminary examination testimony and&para;<br>the jury instructions conference put respondent on notice&para;<br>of the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting&para;<br>theory. See id., at 871–872.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit held, and respondent does not dispute, that respondent initially received adequate notice of&para;<br>the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting&para;<br>theory. The question is therefore whether habeas relief is&para;<br>warranted because the State principally relied at trial on&para;<br>the theory that respondent himself delivered the fatal&para;<br>blow.&para;<br>Assuming, arguendo, that a defendant is entitled to&para;<br>notice of the possibility of conviction on an aiding-andabetting theory, the Ninth Circuit’s grant of habeas relief&para;<br>may be affirmed only if this Court’s cases clearly establish&para;<br>that a defendant, once adequately apprised of such a&para;<br>possibility, can nevertheless be deprived of adequate&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>notice by a prosecutorial decision to focus on another&para;<br>theory of liability at trial. The Ninth Circuit pointed to no&para;<br>case of ours holding as much. Instead, the Court of Appeals cited three older cases that stand for nothing more&para;<br>than the general proposition that a defendant must have&para;<br>adequate notice of the charges against him. See 731 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 866–867 (citing Russell v. United States, 369 U. S. 749,&para;<br>763–764 (1962); In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, 273–274&para;<br>(1948); Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U. S. 196, 201 (1948)).&para;<br>This proposition is far too abstract to establish clearly&para;<br>the specific rule respondent needs. We have before cautioned the lower courts—and the Ninth Circuit in particular—against “framing our precedents at such a high level&para;<br>of generality.” Nevada v. Jackson, 569 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2013) (per curiam) (slip op., at 7). None of our decisions&para;<br>that the Ninth Circuit cited addresses, even remotely, the&para;<br>specific question presented by this case. See Russell,&para;<br>supra, at 752 (indictment for “refus[ing] to answer any&para;<br>question pertinent to [a] question under [congressional]&para;<br>inquiry,” 2 U. S. C. §192, failed to “identify the subject&para;<br>under congressional subcommittee inquiry”); In re Oliver,&para;<br>supra, at 259 (instantaneous indictment, conviction, and&para;<br>sentence by judge acting as grand jury with no prior notice&para;<br>of charge to defendant); Cole, supra, at 197 (affirmance of&para;<br>criminal convictions “under a . . . statute for violation of&para;<br>which [defendants] had not been charged”).1&para;<br>Because our case law does not clearly establish the legal&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Respondent claims that our decision in Lankford v. Idaho, 500 U. S.&para;<br>110 (1991), although not cited by the Ninth Circuit, clearly establishes&para;<br>the legal principle he needs. But Lankford is of no help to respondent.&para;<br>That case addressed whether a defendant had adequate notice of the&para;<br>possibility of imposition of the death penalty—a far different question&para;<br>from whether respondent had adequate notice of the particular theory&para;<br>of liability. See id., at 111. In Lankford, moreover, the trial court itself&para;<br>made specific statements that encouraged the defendant to believe that&para;<br>the death penalty was off the table. See id., at 116–117.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>LOPEZ v. SMITH&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>proposition needed to grant respondent habeas relief, the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit was forced to rely heavily on its own decision in Sheppard, supra. Of course, AEDPA permits&para;<br>habeas relief only if a state court’s decision is “contrary to,&para;<br>or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law” as determined by this Court, not by&para;<br>the courts of appeals. 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). The Ninth&para;<br>Circuit attempted to evade this barrier by holding that&para;<br>Sheppard “faithfully applied the principles enunciated by&para;<br>the Supreme Court in Cole, Oliver, and Russell.” 731&para;<br>F. 3d, at 868. But Circuit precedent cannot “refine or&para;<br>sharpen a general principle of Supreme Court jurisprudence into a specific legal rule that this Court has not&para;<br>announced.” Marshall, 569 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 6).&para;<br>Sheppard is irrelevant to the question presented by this&para;<br>case: whether our case law clearly establishes that a prosecutor’s focus on one theory of liability at trial can render&para;<br>earlier notice of another theory of liability inadequate.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit also disagreed with what it termed&para;<br>the state court’s “determination of the facts”—principally,&para;<br>the state court’s holding that preliminary examination&para;<br>testimony and the prosecutors’ request for an aiding-andabetting jury instruction shortly before closing arguments&para;<br>adequately put respondent on notice of the prosecution’s&para;<br>aiding-and-abetting theory. 731 F. 3d, at 871 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit therefore&para;<br>granted relief under §2254(d)(2), which permits habeas&para;<br>relief where the state-court “decision . . . was based on an&para;<br>unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the&para;<br>evidence presented in the State court proceeding.” That&para;<br>holding cannot be sustained.&para;<br>In purporting to reject the state court’s “determination&para;<br>of the facts,” the Ninth Circuit focused on preliminary&para;<br>examination testimony by an investigator about conversa-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>tions between respondent and his cellmate. According to&para;<br>the investigator, the cellmate stated that respondent told&para;<br>him that respondent “had to get rid of his wife because she&para;<br>was standing in the way of his future plans; that she was&para;<br>threatening to divorce him and he wasn’t going to give up&para;<br>half of his property”; that respondent made his house look&para;<br>like the site of a home invasion robbery; and that, when he&para;<br>left for work the morning of the murder, he left the window open and did not set the alarm. Smith, 2010 WL&para;<br>4975500, at *7. The investigator also testified that the&para;<br>cellmate did not “ ‘know any of the details of the homicide&para;<br>itself and how it was carried out,’ ” and that respondent&para;<br>“ ‘never told [the cellmate] specifically who’ ” committed the&para;<br>homicide. Ibid. The California Court of Appeal held that&para;<br>these statements, taken together, suggested that respondent was involved in planning and facilitating the crime but&para;<br>that the fatal blow might have been delivered by an accomplice. Ibid. Thus, the California court believed that&para;<br>even assuming that the information by itself was not&para;<br>sufficient, this testimony naturally lent itself to conviction&para;<br>on an aiding-and-abetting theory and so gave respondent&para;<br>even greater notice of such a possibility. Ibid.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit also focused on the jury instructions&para;<br>conference, which occurred after the defense rested but&para;<br>before the parties’ closing arguments. During that conference, prosecutors requested an aiding-and-abetting instruction, which further provided notice to respondent.&para;<br>The California Court of Appeal concluded that this case is&para;<br>distinguishable from Sheppard v. Rees, 909 F. 2d 1234,&para;<br>because, unlike that case, the conference here did not&para;<br>occur immediately before closing arguments. The Ninth&para;<br>Circuit disagreed, holding that because “defense counsel&para;<br>had only the lunch recess to formulate a response” to the&para;<br>aiding-and-abetting instruction, this case “is indistinguishable from Sheppard,” where the prosecution also&para;<br>“requested the new instruction the same day as closing.”&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>LOPEZ v. SMITH&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>731 F. 3d, at 868, 870.&para;<br>Although the Ninth Circuit claimed its disagreement&para;<br>with the state court was factual in nature, in reality its&para;<br>grant of relief was based on a legal conclusion about the&para;<br>adequacy of the notice provided. The Ninth Circuit believed that the events detailed above, even when taken&para;<br>together with the information filed against respondent,&para;<br>failed to measure up to the standard of notice applicable in&para;<br>cases like this. That ranked as a legal determination&para;<br>governed by §2254(d)(1), not one of fact governed by&para;<br>§2254(d)(2). But, as we have explained, the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>cited only its own precedent for establishing the appropriate standard. Absent a decision of ours clearly establishing the relevant standard, the Ninth Circuit had nothing&para;<br>against which it could assess, and deem lacking, the notice&para;<br>afforded respondent by the information and proceedings.&para;<br>It therefore had no basis to reject the state court’s assessment that respondent was adequately apprised of the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory.2&para;<br>The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The&para;<br>judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for&para;<br>further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Because&para;<br>&para;<br>we reverse the Ninth Circuit’s decision on the foregoing&para;<br>grounds, we need not opine on the correctness of that court’s discussion&para;<br>of Griffin v. United States, 502 U. S. 46 (1991), or Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993).&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
