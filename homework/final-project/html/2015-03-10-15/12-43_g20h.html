COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL &para;<br>&para;<br>REVENUE&para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–43. Argued February 20, 2013—Decided May 20, 2013&para;<br>In 1997, the United Kingdom (U. K.), newly under Labour Party rule,&para;<br>imposed a one-time “windfall tax” on 32 U. K. companies privatized&para;<br>between 1984 and 1996 by the Conservative government. The companies had been sold to private parties through an initial sale of&para;<br>shares, known as a “flotation.” Some of the companies were required&para;<br>to continue providing services for a fixed period at the same rates&para;<br>they had offered under government control. Many of those companies&para;<br>became dramatically more efficient and earned substantial profits in&para;<br>the process.&para;<br>Petitioner PPL Corporation (PPL), part owner of a privatized U. K.&para;<br>company subject to the windfall tax, claimed a credit for its share of&para;<br>the bill in its 1997 federal income-tax return, relying on Internal&para;<br>Revenue Code §901(b)(1), which states that any “income, war profits,&para;<br>and excess profits taxes” paid overseas are creditable against U. S.&para;<br>income taxes. Treasury Regulation §1.901–2(a)(1) interprets this section to mean that a foreign tax is creditable if its “predominant character” “is that of an income tax in the U. S. sense.” The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) rejected PPL’s claim, but the&para;<br>Tax Court held that the U. K. windfall tax was creditable for U. S.&para;<br>tax purposes under §901. The Third Circuit reversed.&para;<br>Held: The U. K. tax is creditable under §901. Pp. 4–14.&para;<br>(a) Treasury Regulation §1.901–2, which codifies longstanding doctrine dating back to Biddle v. Commissioner, 302 U. S. 573, 578–579&para;<br>(1938), provides the relevant legal standard. First, a tax’s “predominant character,” or the normal manner in which a tax applies, is controlling. See id., at 579. Thus, a foreign tax that operates as an income, war profits, or excess profits tax for most taxpayers is generally&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>creditable. Second, foreign tax creditability depends not on the way a&para;<br>foreign government characterizes its tax but on whether the tax, if&para;<br>enacted in the U. S., would be an income, war profits, or excess profits tax. See §1.901–2(a)(1)(ii). Giving further form to these principles, §1.901–2(a)(3)(i) explains that a foreign tax’s predominant character is that of a U. S. income tax “[i]f . . . the foreign tax is likely to&para;<br>reach net gain in the normal circumstances in which it applies.”&para;<br>Three tests set forth in the regulations provide guidance in making&para;<br>this assessment, see §1.901–2(b)(1). The tests indicate that net gain&para;<br>consists of realized gross receipts reduced by significant costs and expenses attributable to such gross receipts, in combination known as&para;<br>net income. A foreign tax that reaches net income, or profits, is creditable. Pp. 4–7.&para;<br>(b) The U. K. windfall tax’s predominant character is that of an excess profits tax, a category of income tax in the U. S. sense. The Labour government’s conception of “profit-making value” as a backwardlooking analysis of historic profits is not a typical valuation&para;<br>method. Rather, it is a tax on realized net income disguised as a&para;<br>tax on the difference between two values, one of which is a fictitious&para;<br>value calculated using an imputed price-to-earnings ratio. The substance of the windfall tax confirms this conclusion. When rearranged, the U. K’s formula demonstrates that the windfall tax is economically equivalent to the difference between the profits each&para;<br>company actually earned and the amount the Labour government believed it should have earned given its flotation value. For most of the&para;<br>relevant companies, the U. K. formula’s substantive effect was to impose a 51.71 percent tax on all profits above a threshold, a classic excess profits tax. The Commissioner claims that any algebraic rearrangement is improper because U. S. courts must take the foreign tax&para;<br>rate as written and accept whatever tax base the foreign tax purports&para;<br>to adopt. But such a rigid construction cannot be squared with the&para;<br>black-letter principle that “tax law deals in economic realities, not legal abstractions.” Commissioner v. Southwest Exploration Co., 350&para;<br>U. S. 308, 315. Given the artificiality of the U. K.’s calculation method, this Court follows substance over form and recognizes that the&para;<br>windfall tax is nothing more than a tax on actual profits above a&para;<br>threshold. Pp. 7–11.&para;<br>(c) The Commissioner’s additional arguments in support of his position are similarly unpersuasive.

As a result, the companies could only increase&para;<br>profits during this period by operating more efficiently.&para;<br>Responding to market incentives, many of the companies&para;<br>became dramatically more efficient and earned substantial&para;<br>profits in the process.&para;<br>The U.

In part&para;<br>because of campaign promises to tax what it characterized&para;<br>as undue profits, the Labour Party defeated the Conserva­&para;<br>tive Party at the polls in 1997. Prior to coming to power,&para;<br>Labour Party leaders hired accounting firm Arthur Ander­&para;<br>sen to structure a tax that would capture excess, or “wind­&para;<br>fall,” profits earned during the initial years in which the&para;<br>companies were prohibited from increasing rates.

S. 573, 578–579 (1938), and pro­&para;<br>vides the relevant legal standard.&para;<br>The regulation establishes several principles relevant to&para;<br>our inquiry. First, the “predominant character” of a tax,&para;<br>or the normal manner in which a tax applies, is control­&para;<br>ling. See id., at 579 (“We are here concerned only with&para;<br>the ‘standard’ or normal tax”). Under this principle, a for­&para;<br>eign tax that operates as an income, war profits, or excess&para;<br>profits tax in most instances is creditable, even if it may&para;<br>affect a handful of taxpayers differently. Creditability is&para;<br>an all or nothing proposition. As the Treasury Regula­&para;<br>tions confirm, “a tax either is or is not an income tax, in its&para;<br>entirety, for all persons subject to the tax.” 26 CFR&para;<br>§1.901–2(a)(1).&para;<br>Second, the way a foreign government characterizes its&para;<br>tax is not dispositive with respect to the U. S. creditability&para;<br>analysis. See §1.901–2(a)(1)(ii) (foreign tax creditable if&para;<br>predominantly “an income tax in the U. S. sense”). In&para;<br>Biddle, the Court considered the creditability of certain&para;<br>U. K. taxes on stock dividends under the substantively&para;<br>identical predecessor to §901. The Court recognized that&para;<br>“there is nothing in [the statute’s] language to suggest&para;<br>that in allowing the credit for foreign tax payments, a&para;<br>shifting standard was adopted by reference to foreign&para;<br>characterizations and classifications of tax legislation.”&para;<br>302 U. S., at 578–579. See also United States v. Goodyear&para;<br>Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 493 U. S. 132, 145 (1989) (noting in&para;<br>interpreting 26 U. S. C. §902 that Biddle is particularly&para;<br>applicable “where a contrary interpretation would leave”&para;<br>tax interpretation “to the varying tax policies of foreign&para;<br>tax authorities”); Heiner v. Mellon, 304 U. S. 271, 279, and&para;<br>n. 7 (1938) (state-law definitions generally not controlling&para;<br>in federal tax context). Instead of the foreign govern­&para;<br>ment’s characterization of the tax, the crucial inquiry is&para;<br>the tax’s economic effect. See Biddle, supra, at 579 (in­&para;<br>quiry is “whether [a tax] is the substantial equivalent of&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>payment of the tax as those terms are used in our own&para;<br>statute”). In other words, foreign tax creditability depends&para;<br>on whether the tax, if enacted in the U. S., would be an&para;<br>income, war profits, or excess profits tax.&para;<br>Giving further form to these principles, Treasury Regu­&para;<br>lation §1.901–2(a)(3)(i) explains that a foreign tax’s pre­&para;<br>dominant character is that of a U. S. income tax “[i]f . . .&para;<br>the foreign tax is likely to reach net gain in the normal&para;<br>circumstances in which it applies.” The regulation then&para;<br>sets forth three tests for assessing whether a foreign tax&para;<br>reaches net gain. A tax does so if, “judged on the basis of&para;<br>its predominant character, [it] satisfies each of the realiza­&para;<br>tion, gross receipts, and net income requirements set forth&para;<br>in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3) and (b)(4), respectively, of this&para;<br>section.” §1.901–2(b)(1).3 The tests indicate that net gain&para;<br>(also referred to as net income) consists of realized gross&para;<br>receipts reduced by significant costs and expenses attrib­&para;<br>utable to such gross receipts.

K.’s “windfall tax” formula. See Brief for Respondent&para;<br>23 (“The windfall tax takes into account a company’s prof­&para;<br>its during its four-year initial period”). Indeed, annual&para;<br>profit is a variable in the tax formula. U. K. Windfall Tax&para;<br>Act, sched. 1, §1, cls. 2(2) and 5. It is also undisputed that&para;<br>there is no meaningful difference for our purposes in the&para;<br>accounting principles by which the U. K. and the U. S.&para;<br>calculate profits. See Brief for Petitioners 47. The dis­&para;<br>agreement instead centers on how to characterize the tax&para;<br>formula the Labour Party adopted.&para;<br>The Third Circuit, following the Commissioner’s lead,&para;<br>believed it could look no further than the tax formula that&para;<br>the Parliament enacted and the way in which the Labour&para;<br>government characterized it. Under that view, the wind­&para;<br>fall tax must be considered a tax on the difference between&para;<br>a company’s flotation value (the total amount investors&para;<br>paid for the company when the government sold it) and&para;<br>an imputed “profit-making value,” defined as a company’s&para;<br>“average annual profit during its ‘initial period’ . . . times&para;<br>9, the assumed price-to-earnings ratio.” 665 F. 3d, at 65.&para;<br>So characterized, the tax captures a portion of the differ­&para;<br>ence between the price at which each company was sold&para;<br>and the price at which the Labour government believed&para;<br>each company should have been sold given the actual&para;<br>profits earned during the initial period. Relying on this&para;<br>characterization, the Third Circuit believed the windfall&para;<br>tax failed at least the Treasury Regulation’s realization&para;<br>and gross receipts tests because it reached some artificial&para;<br>form of valuation instead of profits. See id., at 67, and&para;<br>n. 3.&para;<br>In contrast, PPL’s position is that the substance of the&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>windfall tax is that of an income tax in the U. S. sense.&para;<br>While recognizing that the tax ostensibly is based on the&para;<br>difference between two values, it argues that every “vari­&para;<br>able” in the windfall tax formula except for profits and&para;<br>flotation value is fixed (at least with regard to 27 of the 32&para;<br>companies). PPL emphasizes that the only way the La­&para;<br>bour government was able to calculate the imputed “profit­&para;<br>making value” at which it claimed companies should have&para;<br>been privatized was by looking after the fact at the actual&para;<br>profits earned by each company. In PPL’s view, it matters&para;<br>not how the U. K. chose to arrange the formula or what it&para;<br>claimed to be taxing, because a tax based on profits above&para;<br>some threshold is an excess profits tax, regardless of how&para;<br>it is mathematically arranged or what labels foreign law&para;<br>places on it. PPL, thus, contends that the windfall taxes it&para;<br>paid meet the Treasury Regulation’s tests and are credit­&para;<br>able under §901.&para;<br>We agree with PPL and conclude that the predominant&para;<br>character of the windfall tax is that of an excess profits&para;<br>tax, a category of income tax in the U. S. sense. It is&para;<br>important to note that the Labour government’s concep­&para;<br>tion of “profit-making value” as a backward-looking analy­&para;<br>sis of historic profits is not a recognized valuation method;&para;<br>instead, it is a fictitious value calculated using an imputed&para;<br>price-to-earnings ratio. At trial, one of PPL’s expert wit­&para;<br>nesses explained that “ ‘9 is not an accurate P/E multiple,&para;<br>and it is not applied to current or expected future earn­&para;<br>ings.’ ” 135 T. C., at 326, n. 17 (quoting testimony). In­&para;<br>stead, the windfall tax is a tax on realized net income&para;<br>disguised as a tax on the difference between two values,&para;<br>one of which is completely fictitious. See App. 251, Report&para;<br>¶1.7 (“[T]he value in profit making terms described in the&para;<br>wording of the act . . . is not a real value: it is rather a&para;<br>construct based on realised profits that would not have&para;<br>been known at the date of privatisation”).&para;<br>The substance of the windfall tax confirms the accuracy&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

As a result, the Commissioner claims that&para;<br>the analysis begins and ends with the Labour govern­&para;<br>ment’s choice to characterize its tax base as the difference&para;<br>between “profit-making value” and flotation value. Such a&para;<br>rigid construction is unwarranted.

First, the Commissioner attempts to buttress&para;<br>the argument that the windfall tax is a tax on value by&para;<br>noting that some U. S. gift and estate taxes use actual,&para;<br>past profits to estimate value. Brief for Respondent 17–18&para;<br>(citing 26 CFR §20.2031–3 (2012) and 26 U. S. C. §2032A).&para;<br>This argument misses the point. In the case of valuation&para;<br>for gift and estate taxes, past income may be used to esti­&para;<br>mate future income streams. But, it is future revenue­&para;<br>earning potential, reduced to market value, that is subject&para;<br>to taxation. The windfall profits tax, by contrast, undis­&para;<br>putedly taxed past, realized net income alone.&para;<br>The Commissioner contends that the U. K. was not&para;<br>trying to establish valuation as of the 1997 date on which&para;<br>the windfall tax was enacted but instead was attempting&para;<br>to derive a proper flotation valuation as of each company’s&para;<br>flotation date. Brief for Respondent 21. The Commissioner&para;<br>asserts that there was no need to estimate future income (as in the case of the gift or estate recipient) because&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>actual revenue numbers for the privatized companies were&para;<br>available. Ibid. That argument also misses the mark. It&para;<br>is true, of course, that the companies might have been&para;<br>privatized at higher flotation values had the government&para;<br>recognized how efficient—and thus how profitable—the&para;<br>companies would become. But, the windfall tax requires&para;<br>an underlying concept of value (based on actual ex post&para;<br>earnings) that would be alien to any valuer. Taxing ac­&para;<br>tual, realized net income in hindsight is not the same as&para;<br>considering past income for purposes of estimating future&para;<br>earning potential.&para;<br>The Commissioner’s reliance on Example 3 to the&para;<br>Treasury Regulation’s gross receipts test is also misplaced.&para;<br>Id., at 37–38; 26 CFR §1.901–2(b)(3)(ii), Ex. 3. That ex­&para;<br>ample posits a petroleum tax in which “gross receipts from&para;<br>extraction income are deemed to equal 105 percent of the&para;<br>fair market value of petroleum extracted. This computa­&para;<br>tion is designed to produce an amount that is greater than&para;<br>the fair market value of actual gross receipts.” Ibid.&para;<br>Under the example, a tax based on inflated gross receipts&para;<br>is not creditable.&para;<br>The Third Circuit believed that the same type of alge­&para;<br>braic rearrangement used above could also be used to&para;<br>rearrange a tax imposed on Example 3. It hypothesized:&para;<br>“Say that the tax rate on the hypothetical extraction&para;<br>tax is 20%. It is true that a 20% tax on 105% of re­&para;<br>ceipts is mathematically equivalent to a 21% tax on&para;<br>100% of receipts, the latter of which would satisfy the&para;<br>gross receipts requirement. PPL proposes that we&para;<br>make the same move here, increasing the tax rate&para;<br>from 23% to 51.75% so that there is no multiple of re­&para;<br>ceipts in the tax base. But if the regulation allowed&para;<br>us to do that, the example would be a nullity.

Brief for Respondent 37–38.&para;<br>There are three basic problems with this approach. As&para;<br>the Fifth Circuit correctly recognized, there is a difference&para;<br>between imputed and actual receipts. “Example 3 hypoth­&para;<br>esizes a tax on the extraction of petroleum where the&para;<br>income value of the petroleum is deemed to be . . . deliber­&para;<br>ately greater than actual gross receipts.” Entergy Corp.,&para;<br>683 F. 3d, at 238. In contrast, the windfall tax depends&para;<br>on actual figures. Ibid. (“There was no need to calculate&para;<br>imputed gross receipts; gross receipts were actually&para;<br>known”). Example 3 simply addresses a different foreign&para;<br>taxation issue.&para;<br>The argument also incorrectly equates imputed gross&para;<br>receipts under Example 3 with net income. See 665 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 67 (“[a]ny tax on a multiple of receipts or profits”). As&para;<br>noted, a tax is creditable only if it applies to realized gross&para;<br>receipts reduced by significant costs and expenses attributable to such gross receipts. 26 CFR §1.901–2(b)(4)(i). A&para;<br>tax based solely on gross receipts (like the Third Circuit’s&para;<br>analysis) would be noncreditable because it would fail the&para;<br>Treasury Regulation’s net income requirement.&para;<br>Finally, even if expenses were subtracted from imputed&para;<br>gross receipts before a tax was imposed, the effect of in­&para;<br>flating only gross receipts would be to inflate revenue&para;<br>while holding expenses (the other component of net in­&para;<br>come) constant. A tax imposed on inflated income minus&para;<br>actual expenses is not the same as a tax on net income.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Mathematically,&para;<br>&para;<br>the Third Circuit’s hypothetical was incomplete. It&para;<br>should have been:&para;<br>20% [ 105% (Gross Receipts) − Expenses ] = Tax&para;<br>But 105% of gross receipts minus expenses is not net income.

Whether a foreign&para;<br>tax falls within one of these categories depends on whether&para;<br>its “predominant character . . . is that of an income tax&para;<br>in the U.

One way to understand this language is&para;<br>that for a tax to be classed as a creditable income tax,&para;<br>its predominant character must be that of an income tax&para;<br>with respect to “all persons subject to the tax.” Of course,&para;<br>among the many persons subject to a tax, some may face&para;<br>tax burdens different from the majority of affected taxpayers.

This situation often arises when a tax relies on imperfect&para;<br>estimates and assumptions in attempting to calculate net gain. Such a&para;<br>tax strives to treat similarly situated taxpayers the same but fails to do&para;<br>so only because the estimated component inadvertently affects some&para;<br>taxpayers differently.

In contrast, here both of the rate and&para;<br>threshold components vary from company to company&para;<br>according to the D variable.3&para;<br>Seen through this lens, the windfall tax is really a tax&para;<br>on average profits. See Alstott Brief 28–30. Under the&para;<br>parties’ stipulated form of the windfall tax, each company&para;<br>pays a fixed tax rate of 23% on a base that is calculated by&para;<br>first multiplying a company’s daily average profits during&para;<br>its initial period (i.e.,	(&para;<br>ܲ/‫&para;<br>)ܦ‬, or total profits over the initial&para;<br>period divided by the length of the initial period) by a fixed&para;<br>price-to-earnings ratio; and then subtracting that company’s flotation value (‫) ܸܨ‬.

But if a tax only needs to be an income tax for&para;<br>“a substantial number of taxpayers” and does not have to&para;<br>“satisfy the predominant character test in its application&para;<br>to all taxpayers,” Exxon Corp. v. Commissioner, 113 T. C.&para;<br>338, 352 (1999), then this average profits argument cannot&para;<br>get off the ground. Under this reading, the regulations tell&para;<br>courts to treat outliers like Railtrack Group as flukes.&para;<br>At oral argument, the Government apparently rejected&para;<br>the notion that “outliers” like Railtrack Group are relevant&para;<br>to creditability analysis. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35–39. The&para;<br>Government also did not argue these outliers’ relevance&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Petitioners suggested at oral argument that because some of the&para;<br>outlier taxpayers may have been subject to a more favorable regulatory&para;<br>regime in the wake of their privatization, their outsized tax rates are&para;<br>less meaningful because they could recoup their windfall tax burdens.&para;<br>See id., at 16–17. Even accepting the premise of this argument, it still&para;<br>does not change that fact that in “substance,” ante, at 9, the tax functioned as value tax for these companies.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>before the Court of Appeals, ante, at 14, n. 6, and so this&para;<br>argument, and the regulatory interpretation it depends&para;<br>upon, has only been presented to this Court by amici, see&para;<br>Alstott Brief 17–18, 28–30. We are not barred from considering statutory and regulatory interpretations raised in&para;<br>an amicus brief, but we should be “reluctant to do so,”&para;<br>Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452, 457, n. (1994), when&para;<br>the issue is one of first impression and the Federal Government has staked out what appears to be a contrary&para;<br>position. Thus, while I find this argument persuasive, I do&para;<br>not base my analysis of this case on it and therefore concur in the Court’s opinion.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
