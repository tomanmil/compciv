UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–62. Argued February 26, 2013—Decided June 10, 2013&para;<br>Petitioner Peugh was convicted of five counts of bank fraud for conduct&para;<br>that occurred in 1999 and 2000. At sentencing, he argued that the&para;<br>Ex Post Facto Clause required that he be sentenced under the 1998&para;<br>version of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of&para;<br>his offenses rather than under the 2009 version in effect at the time&para;<br>of sentencing. Under the 1998 Guidelines, Peugh’s sentencing range&para;<br>was 30 to 37 months, but the 2009 Guidelines assigned more severe&para;<br>consequences to his acts, yielding a range of 70 to 87 months. The&para;<br>District Court rejected Peugh’s ex post facto claim and sentenced him&para;<br>to 70 months’ imprisonment. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.&para;<br>675 F. 3d 736, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to&para;<br>Part III–C, concluding that the Ex Post Facto Clause is violated when&para;<br>a defendant is sentenced under Guidelines promulgated after he&para;<br>committed his criminal acts and the new version provides a higher&para;<br>sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense.&para;<br>Pp. 4–13, 15–20.&para;<br>(a) Though no longer mandatory, see United States v. Booker, 543&para;<br>U. S. 220, the Guidelines still play an important role in sentencing&para;<br>procedures. A district court must begin “by correctly calculating the&para;<br>applicable Guidelines range,” Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49,&para;<br>and then consider the parties’ arguments and factors specified in 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §3553(a). 552 U. S., at 49–50. The court “may not presume&para;<br>that the Guidelines range is reasonable,” id., at 50, and must explain&para;<br>the basis for its sentence on the record, ibid. On appeal, a sentence is&para;<br>reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PEUGH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Id., at 51. A district court is to apply the Guidelines “in effect on the&para;<br>date the defendant is sentenced,” §3553(a)(4)(A)(ii), but, per the&para;<br>Guidelines, is to use the Guidelines in effect on the date the offense&para;<br>was committed should the Guidelines in effect on the sentencing date&para;<br>be found to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Pp. 4–7.&para;<br>(b) The Constitution forbids the passage of ex post facto laws, a category including, as relevant here, “[e]very law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to&para;<br>the crime, when committed.” Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390. The&para;<br>“scope of this Latin phrase” is given “substance by an accretion of&para;<br>case law.” Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 292. The touchstone of&para;<br>the inquiry is whether a given change in law presents a “ ‘sufficient&para;<br>risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered&para;<br>crimes.’ ” Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244, 250. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(c) The most relevant prior decision is Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S.&para;<br>423. There, the Court found an ex post facto violation when the petitioner was sentenced under Florida’s new sentencing guidelines,&para;<br>which yielded a higher sentencing range than the guidelines in place&para;<br>at the time of his crime. The pre-existing guidelines would have required the sentencing judge to provide clear and convincing reasons&para;<br>in writing for any departure, and the sentence would have been reviewable on appeal. But under the new guidelines, a sentence within&para;<br>the guidelines range required no explanation and was unreviewable.&para;<br>Variation in the sentence, though possible, was burdensome; so in the&para;<br>ordinary case, a defendant would receive a within-guidelines sentence. Thus, increasing the applicable guidelines range created a&para;<br>significant risk of a higher sentence.&para;<br>The same principles apply to the post-Booker federal sentencing&para;<br>scheme, which aims to achieve uniformity by ensuring that sentencing decisions are anchored by the Guidelines. Normally, a “judge will&para;<br>use the Guidelines range as the starting point in the analysis and&para;<br>impose a sentence within the range.” Freeman v. United States, 564&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___. That the court may impose a sentence outside that&para;<br>range does not deprive the Guidelines of force as the framework for&para;<br>sentencing. Uniformity is also promoted by appellate review for reasonableness with the Guidelines as a benchmark. Appellate courts&para;<br>may presume a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable, see Rita v.&para;<br>United States, 551 U. S. 338, 347, and may “consider the extent of the&para;<br>deviation” from the Guidelines as part of their reasonableness review, Gall, 552 U. S., at 51. The sentencing regime also puts in place&para;<br>procedural hurdles that, in practice, make imposition of a nonGuidelines sentence less likely. Florida’s scheme and the federal regime differ, but those differences are not dispositive. Common sense&para;<br>indicates that the federal system generally will steer district courts to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>more within-Guidelines sentences, and considerable empirical evidence suggests that the Guidelines have that effect. A retrospective&para;<br>increase in an applicable Guidelines range thus creates a sufficient&para;<br>risk of a higher sentence to constitute an ex post facto violation.&para;<br>Pp. 9–13.&para;<br>(d) The Government’s contrary arguments are unpersuasive. Its&para;<br>principal claim is that the Sentencing Guidelines lack sufficient legal&para;<br>effect to attain the status of a “law” within the meaning of the Ex&para;<br>Post Facto Clause. Changes in law need not bind a sentencing authority for there to be an ex post facto violation, and “[t]he presence of&para;<br>discretion does not displace the protections of [that] Clause.” Garner,&para;<br>529 U. S., at 253. As for contrasts between the Federal Guidelines&para;<br>and the Florida system in Miller, the difference between the two systems is one in degree, not in kind. The attributes of post-Booker sentencing fail to show that the Guidelines are but one among many persuasive sources a sentencing court may consult in making a decision.&para;<br>Recognizing an ex post facto violation here is consistent with postBooker Sixth Amendment cases. The Court’s Sixth Amendment cases,&para;<br>which focus on when a given finding of fact is required to make a defendant legally eligible for a more severe penalty, are distinct from its&para;<br>ex post facto cases, which focus on whether a change in law creates a&para;<br>“significant risk” of a higher sentence. The Booker remedy was designed, and has been subsequently calibrated, to exploit precisely this&para;<br>distinction: promoting sentencing uniformity while avoiding a Sixth&para;<br>Amendment violation. Nothing in this case undoes the holdings of&para;<br>such cases as Booker, Rita, and Gall. Pp. 15–19.&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part&para;<br>III–C.

The U. S.&para;<br>Sentencing Guidelines set forth an advisory sentencing&para;<br>range for each defendant convicted in federal court. We&para;<br>consider here whether there is an ex post facto violation&para;<br>when a defendant is sentenced under Guidelines promulgated after he committed his criminal acts and the new&para;<br>version provides a higher applicable Guidelines sentencing&para;<br>range than the version in place at the time of the offense.&para;<br>We hold that there is.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Petitioner Marvin Peugh and his cousin, Steven Hollewell, ran two farming-related businesses in Illinois. Grainery, Inc., bought, stored, and sold grain; Agri-Tech, Inc.,&para;<br>provided farming services to landowners and tenants.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>*JUSTICE KENNEDY joins this opinion except as to Part III–C.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PEUGH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>When the Grainery began experiencing cash-flow problems, Peugh and Hollewell engaged in two fraudulent&para;<br>schemes. First, they obtained a series of bank loans by&para;<br>representing falsely the existence of contracts for future&para;<br>grain deliveries from Agri-Tech to the Grainery. When&para;<br>they failed to pay back the principal on these loans, the&para;<br>bank suffered losses of over $2 million. Second, they artificially inflated the balances of accounts under their control by “check kiting,” or writing bad checks between their&para;<br>accounts. This scheme allowed them to overdraw an&para;<br>account by $471,000. They engaged in their illicit conduct&para;<br>in 1999 and 2000.&para;<br>When their acts were uncovered, Peugh and Hollewell&para;<br>were charged with nine counts of bank fraud, in violation&para;<br>of 18 U. S. C. §1344. While Hollewell pleaded guilty to&para;<br>one count of check kiting, Peugh pleaded not guilty and&para;<br>went to trial, where he testified that he had not intended&para;<br>to defraud the banks. The jury found him guilty of five&para;<br>counts of bank fraud and acquitted him of the remaining&para;<br>counts.&para;<br>At sentencing, Peugh argued that the Ex Post Facto&para;<br>Clause required that he be sentenced under the 1998&para;<br>version of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in effect at&para;<br>the time of his offenses, rather than under the 2009 version in effect at the time of sentencing. The two versions&para;<br>yielded significantly different results for Peugh’s applicable Guidelines sentencing range. Under the 1998 Guidelines, Peugh’s base offense level was 6. United States&para;<br>Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §2F1.1 (Nov.&para;<br>1998) (USSG). Thirteen levels were added for a loss&para;<br>amount of over $2.5 million, ibid., and 2 levels for obstruction of justice because of Peugh’s perjury at trial, see&para;<br>USSG §3C1.1 (Nov. 1998). The total offense level under&para;<br>the 1998 Guidelines was therefore 19. As a first-time&para;<br>offender, Peugh was in Criminal History Category I, and&para;<br>so his sentencing range under the 1998 Guidelines was 30&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to 37 months. USSG, ch. 5, pt. A (Nov. 1998).&para;<br>The 2009 Guidelines in effect when Peugh was sentenced in May 2010 assigned more severe consequences to&para;<br>his acts. First, the base offense level was raised from 6&para;<br>to 7 for crimes, like Peugh’s, that have a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years or more. See USSG&para;<br>§2B1.1 (Nov. 2009); 18 U. S. C. §1344. Second, the enhancement for a loss exceeding $2.5 million was 18, a&para;<br>5-level increase from the 1998 Guidelines. USSG 2B1.1&para;<br>(Nov. 2009). After adding the 2-level enhancement for&para;<br>obstruction of justice, Peugh’s total offense level under the&para;<br>2009 Guidelines was 27. With a Criminal History Category of I, Peugh’s sentencing range rose under the 2009&para;<br>Guidelines to 70 to 87 months. USSG, ch. 5, pt. A (Nov.&para;<br>2009). The low end of the 2009 Guidelines range was 33&para;<br>months higher than the high end of the 1998 Guidelines&para;<br>range.&para;<br>At the sentencing hearing, the District Court rejected&para;<br>Peugh’s argument that applying the 2009 Guidelines violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, noting that it was foreclosed by Seventh Circuit precedent. App. 30 (discussing&para;<br>United States v. Demaree, 459 F. 3d 791 (2006)). The&para;<br>District Court declined to give Peugh a downward variance, concluding that “a sentence within the [G]uideline[s]&para;<br>range is the most appropriate sentence in this case,” App.&para;<br>100. It sentenced Peugh to 70 months’ imprisonment,&para;<br>ibid., the bottom of the 2009 Guidelines range.&para;<br>The Seventh Circuit, in keeping with its decision in&para;<br>Demaree, rejected Peugh’s ex post facto claim and affirmed&para;<br>his conviction and sentence. 675 F. 3d 736 (2012). We&para;<br>granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Courts of&para;<br>Appeals over whether the Ex Post Facto Clause may be&para;<br>violated when a defendant is sentenced under the version&para;<br>of the Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing rather than the version in effect at the time the&para;<br>crime was committed, and the newer Guidelines yield a&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PEUGH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>higher applicable sentencing range.1 568 U. S. ___ (2012).&para;<br>We now reverse.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Prior to 1984, the broad discretion of sentencing courts&para;<br>and parole officers had led to significant sentencing disparities among similarly situated offenders. To address&para;<br>this problem, Congress created the United States Sentencing Commission. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361,&para;<br>362, 366–367 (1989). The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,&para;<br>98 Stat. 1987, eliminated parole in the federal system and&para;<br>directed the Sentencing Commission to promulgate uniform guidelines that would be binding on federal courts at&para;<br>sentencing. Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 367. The Commission&para;<br>produced the now familiar Sentencing Guidelines: a system under which a set of inputs specific to a given case&para;<br>(the particular characteristics of the offense and offender)&para;<br>yielded a predetermined output (a range of months within&para;<br>which the defendant could be sentenced).&para;<br>In United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 244 (2005),&para;<br>however, this Court held that mandatory Guidelines ran&para;<br>afoul of the Sixth Amendment by allowing judges to find&para;<br>facts that increased the penalty for a crime beyond “the&para;<br>maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of&para;<br>guilty or a jury verdict.” See also Apprendi v. New Jersey,&para;<br>530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000). The appropriate remedy for&para;<br>this violation, the Court determined, was to strike those&para;<br>portions of the Sentencing Reform Act that rendered the&para;<br>Guidelines mandatory. Booker, 543 U. S., at 245–258.&para;<br>Under the resulting scheme, a district court is still re——————&para;<br>1 Compare United States v.

But the Guidelines are no&para;<br>longer binding, and the district court must consider all of&para;<br>the factors set forth in §3553(a) to guide its discretion at&para;<br>sentencing, see Booker, 543 U. S., at 259–260, 264. The&para;<br>Booker remedy, “while not the system Congress enacted,”&para;<br>was designed to “continue to move sentencing in Congress’&para;<br>preferred direction, helping to avoid excessive sentencing&para;<br>disparities while maintaining flexibility sufficient to individualize sentences where necessary.” Id., at 264–265.&para;<br>Our subsequent decisions have clarified the role that&para;<br>the Guidelines play in sentencing procedures, both at the&para;<br>district court level and when sentences are reviewed on&para;<br>appeal. First, “a district court should begin all sentencing&para;<br>proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range. As a matter of administration and to secure&para;<br>nationwide consistency, the Guidelines should be the&para;<br>starting point and the initial benchmark.” Gall v. United&para;<br>States, 552 U. S. 38, 49 (2007) (citation omitted). The&para;<br>district court must then consider the arguments of the parties and the factors set forth in §3553(a). Id., at 49–50.&para;<br>The district court “may not presume that the Guidelines&para;<br>range is reasonable,” id., at 50; and it “may in appropriate&para;<br>cases impose a non-Guidelines sentence based on disagreement with the [Sentencing] Commission’s views,” Pepper v. United States, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,&para;<br>at 23) (citing Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85,&para;<br>109–110 (2007)). The district court must explain the basis&para;<br>for its chosen sentence on the record. Gall, 552 U. S., at&para;<br>50. “[A] major departure [from the Guidelines] should be&para;<br>supported by a more significant justification than a minor&para;<br>one.” Ibid.&para;<br>On appeal, the district court’s sentence is reviewed for&para;<br>reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard.&para;<br>See id., at 51; Booker, 543 U. S., at 261–264. Failure to&para;<br>calculate the correct Guidelines range constitutes proce-&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PEUGH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>dural error, as does treating the Guidelines as mandatory.&para;<br>Gall, 552 U. S., at 51. The court of appeals may, but is&para;<br>not required to, presume that a within-Guidelines sentence&para;<br>is reasonable. Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338, 347&para;<br>(2007). The reviewing court may not apply a heightened&para;<br>standard of review or a presumption of unreasonableness&para;<br>to sentences outside the Guidelines range, although it&para;<br>“will, of course, take into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the&para;<br>Guidelines range.” Gall, 552 U. S., at 49–51. We have indicated that “a district court’s decision to vary from the&para;<br>advisory Guidelines may attract greatest respect when” it&para;<br>is based on the particular facts of a case. Kimbrough, 552&para;<br>U. S., at 109.2 Overall, this system “requires a court to&para;<br>give respectful consideration to the Guidelines,” but it&para;<br>“permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other&para;<br>statutory concerns as well.” Id., at 101 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted).&para;<br>Under 18 U. S. C. §3553(a)(4)(A)(ii), district courts are&para;<br>instructed to apply the Sentencing Guidelines issued by&para;<br>the United States Sentencing Commission that are “in&para;<br>effect on the date the defendant is sentenced.” The Sentencing Guidelines reiterate that statutory directive, with&para;<br>the proviso that “[i]f the Court determines that use of the&para;<br>Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant&para;<br>is sentenced would violate the [E]x [P]ost [F]acto [C]lause&para;<br>of the United States Constitution, the court shall use the&para;<br>Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the offense&para;<br>of conviction was committed.” USSG §§1B1.11(a), (b)(1)&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 We have left open the question whether “closer [appellate] review [of&para;<br>a non-Guidelines sentence] may be in order when the sentencing judge&para;<br>varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judge’s view that the&para;<br>Guidelines range ‘fails properly to reflect §3553(a) considerations’ even&para;<br>in a mine-run case.” Kimbrough, 552 U.

S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(Nov. 2012). Whether the Ex Post Facto Clause was violated by the use of the more onerous Guidelines in effect&para;<br>on the date of Peugh’s sentencing is the question presented here.&para;<br>III&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Constitution prohibits both federal and state governments from enacting any “ex post facto Law.” Art. I, §9,&para;<br>cl. 3; Art. I, §10. The phrase “ ‘ex post facto law’ was a&para;<br>term of art with an established meaning at the time of the&para;<br>framing.” Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 41 (1990).&para;<br>In Calder v. Bull, Justice Chase reviewed the definition&para;<br>that the term had acquired in English common law:&para;<br>“1st. Every law that makes an action done before the&para;<br>passing of the law, and which was innocent when&para;<br>done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every&para;<br>law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than&para;<br>it was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes&para;<br>the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment,&para;<br>than the law annexed to the crime, when committed.&para;<br>4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence,&para;<br>and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law&para;<br>required at the time of the commission of the offence,&para;<br>in order to convict the offender.” 3 Dall., at 390 (emphasis deleted).&para;<br>See also Carmell v. Texas, 529 U. S. 513, 521–525 (2000)&para;<br>(discussing Calder v. Bull and the common-law understanding of the term). Building on Justice Chase’s formulation of what constitutes an “ex post facto Law,” our cases&para;<br>“have not attempted to precisely delimit the scope of this&para;<br>Latin phrase, but have instead given it substance by an&para;<br>accretion of case law.” Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282,&para;<br>292 (1977).&para;<br>At issue here is Calder’s third category of ex post facto&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PEUGH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>laws, those that “chang[e] the punishment, and inflic[t] a&para;<br>greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime,&para;<br>when committed.” 3 Dall., at 390. Peugh’s claim is that&para;<br>the Clause was violated because the 2009 Guidelines call&para;<br>for a greater punishment than attached to bank fraud in&para;<br>2000, when his crimes were completed. The Government&para;<br>counters that because the more punitive Guidelines applied at Peugh’s sentencing were only advisory, there was&para;<br>no ex post facto problem.&para;<br>Each of the parties can point to prior decisions of this&para;<br>Court that lend support to its view. On the one hand, we&para;<br>have never accepted the proposition that a law must increase the maximum sentence for which a defendant is&para;<br>eligible in order to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. See,&para;<br>e.g., Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397 (1937). Moreover, the fact that the sentencing authority exercises some&para;<br>measure of discretion will also not defeat an ex post facto&para;<br>claim. See Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244, 253 (2000). On&para;<br>the other hand, we have made it clear that mere speculation or conjecture that a change in law will retrospectively&para;<br>increase the punishment for a crime will not suffice to&para;<br>establish a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. See&para;<br>California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499,&para;<br>509 (1995). The touchstone of this Court’s inquiry is&para;<br>whether a given change in law presents a “ ‘sufficient risk&para;<br>of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the&para;<br>covered crimes.’ ” Garner, 529 U. S., at 250 (quoting Morales, 514 U. S., at 509).

Florida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987), in which this&para;<br>Court considered an ex post facto challenge to a sentencing&para;<br>guidelines scheme implemented by the State of Florida.&para;<br>Under Florida’s system, a calculation under the guidelines&para;<br>yielded a presumptive sentencing range. Id., at 426. This&para;<br>range was assumed to be appropriate, and the sentencing&para;<br>judge had discretion to fix a sentence within that range&para;<br>“ ‘without the requirement of a written explanation.’ ”&para;<br>Ibid. (quoting Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.701(d)(8) (1983)).&para;<br>If the court wished to depart from the guidelines range,&para;<br>however, it was required to give “clear and convincing&para;<br>reasons in writing for doing so.” 482 U. S., at 426. A&para;<br>within-guidelines sentence was unreviewable; a nonguidelines sentence was subject to appellate review. Ibid.&para;<br>The petitioner in Miller had been sentenced under new&para;<br>guidelines that yielded a higher sentencing range than&para;<br>the guidelines that had been in place at the time of his&para;<br>crime, and he had received a sentence at the top of the new&para;<br>range. Ibid. This Court found an ex post facto violation.&para;<br>We emphasized that in order to impose the petitioner’s&para;<br>sentence under the pre-existing guidelines, the sentencing judge would have been required to provide clear and&para;<br>convincing reasons in writing for the departure, and the&para;<br>sentence would then have been reviewable on appeal. Id.,&para;<br>at 432. In contrast, because the sentence imposed was&para;<br>within the new guidelines range, it required no explanation and was unreviewable. Id., at 432–433. The fact that&para;<br>Florida’s guidelines “create[d] a high hurdle that must be&para;<br>cleared before discretion can be exercised” was sufficient&para;<br>to render the changed guidelines an ex post facto law. Id.,&para;<br>at 435.&para;<br>Miller thus establishes that applying amended sentencing guidelines that increase a defendant’s recommended&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PEUGH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sentence can violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, notwithstanding the fact that sentencing courts possess discretion&para;<br>to deviate from the recommended sentencing range. The&para;<br>sentencing scheme in Miller was designed to channel sentences for similarly situated offenders into a specified&para;<br>range. Its reason-giving requirements and standards of&para;<br>appellate review meant that while variation was possible,&para;<br>it was burdensome; and so in the ordinary case, a defendant would receive a within-guidelines sentence. Under the&para;<br>Florida system, therefore, an increase in the guidelines&para;<br>range applicable to an offender created a significant risk&para;<br>that he would receive a higher sentence.4 The same principles apply here.&para;<br>The post-Booker federal sentencing scheme aims to&para;<br>achieve uniformity by ensuring that sentencing decisions&para;<br>are anchored by the Guidelines and that they remain a&para;<br>meaningful benchmark through the process of appellate&para;<br>review. See Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 107. As we have&para;<br>described, “district courts must begin their analysis with&para;<br>the Guidelines and remain cognizant of them throughout&para;<br>the sentencing process.” Gall, 552 U. S., at 50, n. 6 (emphasis added). Failing to calculate the correct Guidelines&para;<br>range constitutes procedural error. Id., at 51. A district&para;<br>court contemplating a non-Guidelines sentence “must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the&para;<br>justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.” Id., at 50.

Even if the sentencing judge sees a reason to vary from the Guidelines, “if&para;<br>the judge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point&para;<br>to explain the decision to deviate from it, then the Guidelines are in a real sense the basis for the sentence.” Ibid.&para;<br>(emphasis added).

The&para;<br>Florida Legislature had made a within-guidelines sentence unreviewable; whereas in the federal system, the&para;<br>courts of appeals may—but are not required to—presume&para;<br>that a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable. And&para;<br>under Florida’s scheme, a sentencing court departing from&para;<br>the guideline range was required to provide “clear and&para;<br>convincing” reasons for the departure; whereas this Court&para;<br>has not, post-Booker, applied such an exacting across-theboard standard of review to variances.

See also Baron-Evans &amp; Stith, Booker Rules,&para;<br>160 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1631, 1677 (2012). Moreover, the Sentencing Commission’s data indicate that when a Guidelines range moves up or down, offenders’ sentences move&para;<br>with it.

The&para;<br>Framers considered ex post facto laws to be “contrary to&para;<br>the first principles of the social compact and to every&para;<br>principle of sound legislation.” The Federalist No. 44,&para;<br>p. 282 (C.

Brief for United States 49–50. But these arguments do not&para;<br>refute the basic point that the applicable Guidelines channel sentences&para;<br>toward the specified range, even if they do not fix them within it.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>PEUGH v.

S., at 533.&para;<br>The Sentencing Guidelines represent the Federal Government’s authoritative view of the appropriate sentences&para;<br>for specific crimes. When Peugh committed his crime,&para;<br>the recommended sentence was 30 to 37 months. When he&para;<br>was sentenced, it was 70 to 87 months. “[T]he purpose&para;<br>and effect of the change in [the Guidelines calculation]&para;<br>was to increase the rates and length of incarceration for&para;<br>[fraud].” Miller, 482 U. S., at 431 (citing Florida Bar:&para;<br>Amendment to Rules of Criminal Procedure (3.701, 3.988—&para;<br>Sentencing Guidelines), 451 So. 2d 824, 824, n. (1984) ( per&para;<br>curiam) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). Such a retrospective increase in the measure of&para;<br>punishment raises clear ex post facto concerns. We have&para;<br>previously recognized, for instance, that a defendant&para;<br>charged with an increased punishment for his crime is&para;<br>likely to feel enhanced pressure to plead guilty. See&para;<br>Carmell, 529 U. S., at 534, n. 24; Weaver, 450 U. S., at&para;<br>32. This pressure does not disappear simply because the&para;<br>Guidelines range is advisory; the defendant will be aware&para;<br>that the range is intended to, and usually does, exert&para;<br>controlling influence on the sentence that the court will&para;<br>impose.&para;<br>We are therefore not persuaded by the argument advanced by the Government and also suggested by the&para;<br>dissent that the animating principles of the Ex Post Facto&para;<br>Clause are not implicated by this case. While the Government argues that the Sentencing Commission is insulated from legislative interference, see Brief for United&para;<br>States 42–44, our precedents make clear that the coverage&para;<br>of the Ex Post Facto Clause is not limited to legislative&para;<br>acts, see Garner, 529 U. S., at 247, 257 (recognizing that a&para;<br>change in a parole board’s rules could, given an adequate&para;<br>showing, run afoul of the Ex Post Facto Clause). It is true&para;<br>that we held, in Irizarry v. United States, 553 U. S. 708,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>713–714 (2008), that a defendant does not have an “expectation subject to due process protection” that he will be&para;<br>sentenced within the Guidelines range. But, contrary to&para;<br>the dissent’s view, see post, at 11–13, the Ex Post Facto&para;<br>Clause does not merely protect reliance interests. It also&para;<br>reflects principles of “fundamental justice.” Carmell, 529&para;<br>U. S., at 531.6&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The Government’s principal argument that there is no&para;<br>constitutional violation in this case is that the Sentencing&para;<br>Guidelines lack sufficient legal effect to attain the status of a “law” within the meaning of the Ex Post Facto&para;<br>Clause. Whereas the pre-Booker Guidelines “ha[d] the force&para;<br>and effect of laws,” Booker, 543 U. S., at 234, the postBooker Guidelines, the Government contends, have lost that&para;<br>status due to their advisory nature. The dissent echoes&para;<br>this argument. Post, at 1–3, 6–8.&para;<br>The distinction that the Government draws is necessarily a fine one, because our precedents firmly establish that&para;<br>changes in law need not bind a sentencing authority in&para;<br>order to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. So, for example,&para;<br>a law can run afoul of the Clause even if it does not alter&para;<br>the statutory maximum punishment attached to a crime.&para;<br>In Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397, this Court considered an ex post facto challenge to a Washington law&para;<br>altering the statutory penalty for grand larceny from a&para;<br>range of 0 to 15 years’ imprisonment to a mandatory term&para;<br>of 15 years’ imprisonment.

S., at 253. In a series of&para;<br>cases, for example, this Court has considered the validity&para;<br>under the Ex Post Facto Clause of state laws altering the&para;<br>terms on which discretionary parole or early release was&para;<br>available to prisoners. See Garner, 529 U. S. 244; Morales, 514 U. S. 499; Weaver, 450 U. S. 24. Although these&para;<br>cases reached differing conclusions with respect to whether&para;<br>there was an ex post facto violation, in none of them did&para;<br>we indicate that the mere fact that the prisoner was not&para;<br>guaranteed parole but rather received it at the will of the&para;<br>parole board was fatal to his claim.

It contrasts the Sentencing Guidelines with the Florida system at issue in Miller,&para;<br>which, the Government indicates, really did place “a substantial legislative constraint on the judge’s exercise of&para;<br>sentencing discretion.” Brief for United States 21. But as&para;<br>we have explained at length, the difference between the&para;<br>federal system and the scheme the Court considered in&para;<br>Miller is one in degree, not in kind. The Florida system&para;<br>did not achieve its “binding legal effect,” Brief for United&para;<br>States 22, by mandating a within-guidelines sentence in&para;<br>every case. Rather, it achieved its “binding legal effect”&para;<br>through a set of procedural rules and standards for appellate review that, in combination, encouraged district&para;<br>courts to sentence within the guidelines. See Miller, 482&para;<br>U. S., at 432–433. We have detailed all of the ways in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 23); and all sentences are&para;<br>reviewed under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.&para;<br>See supra, at 5–6.&para;<br>While the Government accurately describes several&para;<br>attributes of federal sentencing after Booker, the conclusion it draws by isolating these features of the system is&para;<br>ultimately not supportable. On the Government’s account,&para;<br>the Guidelines are just one among many persuasive&para;<br>sources a sentencing court can consult, no different from&para;<br>a “policy paper.” Brief for United States 28.

Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 391 (1980), and argues that Miller&para;<br>indicated that retrospectively applying more stringent parole guidelines&para;<br>would not have constituted an ex post facto violation. The issue of&para;<br>the constitutional validity of the retrospective application of the parole&para;<br>guidelines, however, was not before the Court in Miller. While the&para;<br>Miller Court did state that lower court cases discussing the federal&para;<br>parole guidelines were “inapposite” to its discussion of the Florida&para;<br>guidelines, 482 U. S., at 434–435, it had no occasion to address whether&para;<br>changes to the parole guidelines generated an ex post facto problem.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>PEUGH v.

Courts of appeals, in turn, are not&para;<br>permitted to presume that a sentence that comports with&para;<br>a particular policy paper is reasonable; nor do courts of&para;<br>appeals, in considering whether the district court’s sentence was reasonable, weigh the extent of any departure&para;<br>from a given policy paper in determining whether the&para;<br>district court abused its discretion, see id., at 51. It is&para;<br>simply not the case that the Sentencing Guidelines are&para;<br>merely a volume that the district court reads with academic interest in the course of sentencing.&para;<br>Of course, as the Government and the dissent point out,&para;<br>notwithstanding a rule that retrospective application of a&para;<br>higher Guidelines range violates the Ex Post Facto Clause,&para;<br>sentencing courts will be free to give careful consideration&para;<br>to the current version of the Guidelines as representing&para;<br>the most recent views of the agency charged by Congress&para;<br>with developing sentencing policy. See post, at 8 (citing&para;<br>Demaree, 459 F. 3d, at 795). But this does not render our&para;<br>holding “purely semantic.” Id., at 795. District courts&para;<br>must begin their sentencing analysis with the Guidelines&para;<br>in effect at the time of the offense and use them to calculate the sentencing range correctly; and those Guidelines&para;<br>will anchor both the district court’s discretion and the&para;<br>appellate review process in all of the ways we have described. The newer Guidelines, meanwhile, will have the&para;<br>status of one of many reasons a district court might give&para;<br>for deviating from the older Guidelines, a status that is&para;<br>simply not equivalent for ex post facto purposes.&para;<br>Finally, the Government contends that a rule that the&para;<br>Ex Post Facto Clause is violated by the application of an&para;<br>increased Guidelines range would be in tension with this&para;<br>Court’s post-Booker cases and, indeed, would “largely undo&para;<br>. . . the Booker remedy” for the Sixth Amendment violation&para;<br>found there.

The Government’s argument assumes that the Sixth Amendment&para;<br>and the Ex Post Facto Clause share a common boundary;&para;<br>that only where judge-found facts are the basis of a higher&para;<br>sentence in a manner that raises Sixth Amendment concerns can a set of sentencing rules be sufficiently determinate to run afoul of the Ex Post Facto Clause. But the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment and Ex Post Facto Clause inquiries are&para;<br>analytically distinct. Our Sixth Amendment cases have&para;<br>focused on when a given finding of fact is required to make&para;<br>a defendant legally eligible for a more severe penalty. Our&para;<br>ex post facto cases, in contrast, have focused on whether a&para;<br>change in law creates a “significant risk” of a higher sentence; here, whether a sentence in conformity with the&para;<br>new Guidelines is substantially likely. The Booker remedy&para;<br>was designed, and has been subsequently calibrated, to&para;<br>exploit precisely this distinction: it is intended to promote&para;<br>sentencing uniformity while avoiding a Sixth Amendment&para;<br>violation. In light of the statistics invoked by petitioner,&para;<br>see supra, at 12–13, it appears so far to be achieving this&para;<br>balance.

Therefore, I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>It is well established that an ex post facto law includes&para;<br>“[e]very law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a&para;<br>greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime,&para;<br>when committed.” Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798)&para;<br>(opinion of Chase, J.). Under our precedents, the relevant&para;<br>inquiry for determining whether a law “inflicts a greater&para;<br>punishment,” is whether the “retroactive application of&para;<br>the change in [the] law created ‘a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered&para;<br>crimes.’ ” Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244, 250 (2000) (quoting California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S.&para;<br>499, 509 (1995)). The retroactive application of subsequently amended Guidelines does not create a “sufficient&para;<br>risk” of increasing a defendant’s punishment for two rea-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PEUGH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sons. First, the Guidelines do not constrain the discretion&para;<br>of district courts and, thus, have no legal effect on a defendant’s sentence. Second, to the extent that the amended&para;<br>Guidelines create a risk that a defendant might receive&para;<br>a harsher punishment, that risk results from the Guidelines’ persuasive force, not any legal effect. The Guidelines help district judges to impose sentences that comply&para;<br>with §3553(a). The risk of an increased sentence is, in&para;<br>essence, the risk of a more accurate sentence—i.e., a sentence more in line with the statutory scheme’s penological&para;<br>goals. Guideline changes that help district courts achieve&para;<br>such pre-existing statutory sentencing goals do not create&para;<br>a risk of an increased sentence cognizable under the Ex&para;<br>Post Facto Clause. We have never held that government&para;<br>action violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it merely&para;<br>influences the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Federal Sentencing Guidelines do not constrain the&para;<br>discretion of district courts. As we have said repeatedly,&para;<br>the Guidelines are “advisory.” United States v. Booker,&para;<br>543 U. S. 220, 245 (2005) (remedial opinion for the Court&para;<br>by BREYER, J.). For this reason, district courts may not&para;<br>“presume” that a within-Guidelines sentence is appropriate. Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 50 (2007); see also&para;<br>Nelson v. United States, 555 U. S. 350, 352 (2009) ( per&para;<br>curiam) (the Guidelines range is “not to be presumed&para;<br>reasonable”); Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338, 351&para;<br>(2007) (“[T]he sentencing court does not enjoy the benefit&para;<br>of a legal presumption that the Guidelines sentence should&para;<br>apply”). Rather, district courts must “make an individualized assessment” of the appropriate sentence “based on the&para;<br>facts presented.” Gall, supra, at 50. Moreover, a district&para;<br>court may freely depart from the range recommended by&para;<br>the Guidelines based not only on “an individualized determination that [the Guidelines] yield an excessive sen-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tence in a particular case,” but also based on “policy disagreement” with the Guidelines themselves. Spears v.&para;<br>United States, 555 U. S. 261, 264 (2009) (per curiam); see&para;<br>Pepper v. United States, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip&para;<br>op., at 23) (“[O]ur post-Booker decisions make clear that&para;<br>a district court may in appropriate cases impose a nonGuidelines sentence based on a disagreement with the&para;<br>Commission’s views”).&para;<br>It is true that a district judge who “decides that an&para;<br>outside-Guidelines sentence is warranted” must “ensure&para;<br>that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support&para;<br>the degree of the variance” and that “a major departure&para;<br>should be supported by a more significant justification&para;<br>than a minor one.” Gall, 552 U. S., at 50. This does not&para;<br>demonstrate that the Guidelines constrain the judge’s discretion, but rather comports with the notion that an explanation is essential for “meaningful appellate review.”&para;<br>Ibid. And, when a district court departs from the recommended range, the court of appeals may not presume that&para;<br>such a sentence is unreasonable. Id., at 47; id., at 41&para;<br>(“[C]ourts of appeals must review all sentences—whether&para;<br>inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines&para;<br>range—under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard”).&para;<br>While “[t]he applicable guideline [may] nudg[e] [the sentencing judge] toward the sentencing range,” “his freedom&para;<br>to impose a reasonable sentence outside the range is unfettered.” United States v. Demaree, 459 F. 3d 791, 795&para;<br>(CA7 2006).&para;<br>None of petitioner’s arguments to the contrary is persuasive. Petitioner first contends that the Guidelines&para;<br>constrain district courts’ discretion because improperly&para;<br>calculating the applicable guidelines is reversible error.&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 20–21, and n. 7; 18 U. S. C. §3742(f);&para;<br>Cf. Gall, 552 U. S., at 51. This argument is a non sequitur. The Guidelines can only serve their advisory purpose&para;<br>if district courts consider the “range established” by the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PEUGH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Guidelines, §3553(a)(4). For this reason, district courts&para;<br>must “begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range.” Id., at 49. But&para;<br>the fact that courts must give due consideration to the&para;<br>recommendation expressed in the correct Guidelines does&para;<br>not mean that the Guidelines constrain the district court’s&para;<br>discretion to impose an appropriate sentence; it simply&para;<br>means that district courts must consider the correct variables before exercising their discretion.&para;<br>Petitioner next argues that the Guidelines limit district&para;<br>court discretion because sentences falling outside the&para;<br>Guidelines are more likely to be reversed for substantive&para;<br>unreasonableness. Brief for Petitioner 25. I doubt, however, that reversal is a likely outcome when a district&para;<br>judge can justify his sentence based on agreement with&para;<br>either of two Guidelines—the old or the new. If a district court calculated the sentencing range under the&para;<br>new Guidelines but sentenced the defendant to a belowGuidelines sentence that fell within the range provided&para;<br>by the old Guidelines, it would be difficult to label such&para;<br>a sentence “substantively unreasonable.” To do so would&para;<br>cast doubt on every within-Guidelines sentence issued under the old Guidelines. Similarly, it is hard to imagine&para;<br>that a court of appeals would reverse a sentence for substantive unreasonableness if it was above the range of the&para;<br>Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense but fell&para;<br>within the range of the most up-to-date Guidelines. This&para;<br>case provides an apt example. After considering all of&para;<br>the §3553(a)(2) factors, the District Court concluded that&para;<br>a sentence within the amended Guidelines range was “the&para;<br>most appropriate sentence in this case.” App. 100. The&para;<br>same sentence would undoubtedly be upheld on appeal if&para;<br>the District Court, on remand, once again determined that&para;<br>a sentence within the amended Guidelines was appropriate in light of all the facts. The essential point is that once&para;<br>new Guidelines have been promulgated, reasonableness&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>review does not meaningfully constrain the discretion of&para;<br>district courts to sentence offenders within either of the&para;<br>two ranges.&para;<br>The majority argues that our opinion in Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987), supports its conclusion that&para;<br>retroactive application of advisory Guidelines violates the&para;<br>Ex Post Facto Clause. See ante, at 9–10. But Miller leads&para;<br>to the opposite conclusion. There, Florida superimposed&para;<br>narrowed presumptive sentencing ranges on the statutory&para;<br>sentencing ranges for particular crimes. 482 U. S., at&para;<br>425–426. If a judge imposed a sentence within that narrower presumptive range, he did not need to give a written&para;<br>explanation of his reasons for selecting that sentence, and&para;<br>the sentence was not subject to appellate review. Ibid. If&para;<br>the judge imposed a sentence outside the presumptive&para;<br>range, however, he was required to provide “ ‘clear and&para;<br>convincing reasons,’ ” id., at 426 (quoting Fla. Rule Crim.&para;<br>Proc. 3.701(d)(11) (1983)), based “on facts proved beyond a&para;<br>reasonable doubt,” that justified the departure, 482 U. S.,&para;<br>at 432. In concluding that retroactive application of this&para;<br>scheme violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, we reasoned&para;<br>that the Florida guidelines did not “simply provide flexible&para;<br>‘guideposts’ for use in the exercise of discretion: instead,&para;<br>they create[d] a high hurdle that must be cleared before&para;<br>discretion c[ould] be exercised.” Id., at 435.&para;<br>The Court cites Miller for the proposition “that applying&para;<br>amended sentencing guidelines that increase a defendant’s recommended sentence can violate the Ex Post Facto&para;<br>Clause, notwithstanding the fact that sentencing courts&para;<br>possess discretion to deviate from the recommended sentencing range.” Ante, at 10. But that claim is not supported by Miller. The guidelines in Miller violated the Ex&para;<br>Post Facto Clause precisely because they constrained the&para;<br>sentencing judge’s discretion.&para;<br>The Federal Guidelines, by contrast, do no such thing.&para;<br>Indeed, our post-Booker opinions have made abundantly&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PEUGH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>clear that the Guidelines do not create a “high hurdle”—&para;<br>or any hurdle at all—“that must be cleared before discretion can be exercised.” Miller, 482 U. S., at 435. Rather,&para;<br>the Guidelines are “flexible ‘guideposts’ ” which inform the&para;<br>district courts’ discretion. Ibid. Accordingly, their retroactive application cannot constitute a violation of the Ex&para;<br>Post Facto Clause.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Notwithstanding the discretion district courts have to&para;<br>impose appropriate sentences anywhere within the statutory range, Guidelines do “influenc[e] the sentences imposed by judges.” Ante, at 12. But, the Guidelines do this&para;<br>by helping district courts impose sentences that are consistent with §3553(a). It is difficult to see how an advisory Guideline, designed to lead courts to impose sentences&para;<br>more in line with fixed statutory objectives, could ever&para;<br>constitute an ex post facto violation. But that is exactly&para;<br>what the Court concludes.&para;<br>District courts are charged with imposing sentences that&para;<br>are “ ‘sufficient, but not greater than necessary’ to comply&para;<br>with the sentencing purposes set forth in” §3553(a). Pepper, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting §3553(a)).&para;<br>The district court’s task is to impose sentences that reflect&para;<br>the punitive goals of justice, deterrence, protection of the&para;<br>public, and rehabilitation. 18 U. S. C. §3553(a)(2). While&para;<br>easily stated, this goal is difficult to achieve. Enter the&para;<br>Sentencing Guidelines.&para;<br>The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 instructs the Sentencing Commission to promulgate Guidelines that reflect&para;<br>the “same basic §3553(a) objectives” that district courts&para;<br>must consider. Rita, 551 U. S., at 348; see also 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§991(b)(1)(A). In crafting the Guidelines, the Commission&para;<br>began with “an empirical examination of 10,000 presentence reports setting forth what judges had done in the&para;<br>past.” Rita, supra, at 349 (citing United States Sentencing&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Commission, Guidelines Manual §1A1.1, comment., n. 3&para;<br>(Nov. 2006) (USSG)). The Commission then “modif[ied]&para;<br>and adjust[ed] past practice in the interests of greater&para;<br>rationality, avoiding inconsistency, complying with congressional instructions, and the like.” Rita, supra, at 349.&para;<br>While an individual judge has limited experience upon&para;<br>which to draw, the Commission “has the capacity . . . to&para;<br>base its determinations on empirical data and national&para;<br>experience, guided by a professional staff with appropriate&para;<br>expertise.” Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85, 109&para;<br>(2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). And the Commission updates the Guidelines regularly as new information becomes available. It consults with “prosecutors,&para;<br>defenders, law enforcement groups, civil liberties associations, experts in penology, and others,” to ensure that the&para;<br>Guidelines continue to further §3553(a)’s goals. Rita,&para;<br>supra, at 350; see also Booker, 543 U. S., at 263 (noting&para;<br>that the Commission would “modify its Guidelines in light&para;<br>of what it learns, thereby encouraging what it finds to be&para;<br>better sentencing practices”).&para;<br>In light of this extensive study, amendments to the&para;<br>Guidelines should produce sentencing ranges that better&para;<br>comport with the §3553(a) factors. If the Commission has&para;<br>fulfilled its mission of recommending sentences that are&para;<br>generally consistent with §3553(a)(2), then sentences&para;<br>should fall within the Guidelines range most of the time.&para;<br>This, in part, explains why within-Guidelines sentences&para;<br>are presumed, on appeal, to reflect a “discretionary decision” by the district court that “accords with the Commission’s view.” Rita, supra, at 351.&para;<br>Again, this case furnishes a ready example. Prior to petitioner’s sentencing, Congress directed the Commission&para;<br>“to consider” whether fraud guidelines were “ ‘sufficient to&para;<br>deter and punish’ ” particular offenses, in light of increases&para;<br>to statutory maximum penalties for certain fraud crimes&para;<br>other than bank fraud. USSG App. C, Amdt. 653 (Reason&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PEUGH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>for Amendment) (effective Nov. 1, 2003) (quoting WhiteCollar Crime Penalty Enhancement Act of 2002,&para;<br>§905(b)(2), 116 Stat. 805). This produced amended Guidelines, which were based on the Commission’s further&para;<br>assessment of “economic crime issues over a number of&para;<br>years.” USSG App. C, Amdt. 617 (Reason for Amendment)&para;<br>(effective Nov. 1, 2001). With an amended Guidelines&para;<br>sentencing range, the District Court concluded that a&para;<br>within-Guidelines sentence was “the most appropriate&para;<br>sentence.” App. 100. Neither the statutory sentencing&para;<br>range nor §3553(a) changed between the time of petitioner’s offense and sentencing. Thus, it is quite incorrect to&para;<br>say that reliance on information reflected in the amended&para;<br>Guidelines violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.&para;<br>This is underscored by the fact that even the Court’s&para;<br>holding—which requires district courts to calculate the&para;<br>Guidelines range in effect at the time of the offense—will&para;<br>not eliminate the “risk” of a higher sentence. The district&para;<br>judge remains free to consider the range produced by the&para;<br>amended Guidelines. See Demaree, 459 F. 3d, at 795 (“A&para;<br>judge is certainly entitled to take advice from the Sentencing Commission”). Thus, the mere fact that new Guidelines have been promulgated creates some risk of an&para;<br>increased sentence, even if district courts are required to&para;<br>calculate the Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense.&para;<br>Petitioner has presented no evidence indicating what&para;<br>portion of the risk of an increased sentence flows from the&para;<br>retroactive application of the amended Guidelines and&para;<br>what portion flows from their very existence. In the absence of such evidence, even if I agreed that advisory&para;<br>Guidelines could be ex post facto laws, which I do not,&para;<br>I would not find the “risk” of an increased sentence created&para;<br>by the retroactive application of the Guidelines to be “sufficient” for ex post facto purposes.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>II&para;<br>Today’s opinion also demonstrates the unworkability of&para;<br>our ex post facto jurisprudence. Under our current precedent, whenever a change in the law creates a “risk” of an&para;<br>increased sentence, we must determine whether the risk is&para;<br>“sufficient,” see Morales, 514 U. S., at 509, or sufficiently&para;<br>“ ‘significant,’ ” see ante, at 19, to violate the Ex Post Facto&para;<br>Clause. Our analysis under that test has devolved into&para;<br>little more than an exercise in judicial intuition. I would&para;<br>return to the original meaning of the Clause as stated in&para;<br>Justice Chase’s classic Calder formulation, under which&para;<br>laws of this sort are ex post facto only when they retroactively increase the punishment “annexed to the crime.”&para;<br>3 Dall., at 390.&para;<br>A&para;<br>This Court addressed the Ex Post Facto Clause a mere&para;<br>decade after the Constitution was ratified. In Calder,&para;<br>Justice Chase described four types of ex post facto laws. 3&para;<br>Dall., at 390. As relevant, Justice Chase’s third category&para;<br>indicated that “[e]very law that changes the punishment,&para;<br>and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed&para;<br>to the crime, when committed” violates the Ex Post Facto&para;<br>Clause. Ibid. Justice Chase’s emphasis on increases&para;<br>in the punishment “annexed to the crime” was grounded&para;<br>in the English common law and accurately reflected the&para;<br>original understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause. See&para;<br>Part II–B, infra. Unfortunately, the Court rapidly deviated&para;<br>from this formulation. In Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S.&para;<br>221 (1883), the Court declared that “any law passed after&para;<br>the commission of an offence which . . . ‘in relation to that&para;<br>offence, or its consequences, alters the situation of a party&para;<br>to his disadvantage,’ is an ex post facto law.” Id., at 235&para;<br>(quoting Justice Washington’s jury charge in United States&para;<br>v. Hall, 26 F. Cas. 84, 86 (No. 15,285) (CC Pa. 1809) (emphasis added). It took nearly a century for the Court to&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PEUGH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>decide that Kring’s “departure from Calder’s explanation&para;<br>of the original understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause&para;<br>was . . . unjustified.” Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37,&para;<br>49 (1990) (overruling Kring).&para;<br>Following Collins’ disavowal of Kring, the Court held&para;<br>that a law is ex post facto if it “produces a sufficient risk&para;<br>of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the&para;<br>covered crimes.” Morales, supra, at 509. While Morales&para;<br>avoided the over-breadth of Kring’s “disadvantage the defendant” test, it failed to reconnect our ex post facto jurisprudence to the original understanding of the term.&para;<br>The “sufficient risk” test also depends upon empirical&para;<br>analysis that cannot yield determinative answers and&para;<br>which courts are ill equipped to handle. See, e.g., Garner, 529 U. S., at 255 (“When the rule does not by its&para;<br>own terms show a significant risk, the respondent must&para;<br>demonstrate, by evidence drawn from the rule’s practical&para;<br>implementation by the agency charged with exercising&para;<br>discretion, that its retroactive application will result in&para;<br>a longer period of incarceration than under the earlier&para;<br>rule”). More fundamentally, the “sufficient risk” test, like&para;<br>the “disadvantage the defendant” test, wrongly focuses on&para;<br>the particular sentence that the defendant might receive,&para;<br>rather than on the punishment “annexed to the crime.”&para;<br>The practical difficulties with the test are apparent even&para;<br>from our application in Morales, where we considered an&para;<br>amendment to California’s parole procedures that allowed,&para;<br>under certain circumstances, the Board of Prison Terms to&para;<br>decrease the frequency of parole suitability hearings.&para;<br>Under the sufficient risk test, we were compelled to speculate about the possible effects of the new law on various&para;<br>individuals’ prison terms. Ultimately, we held that the&para;<br>amendment did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause be——————&para;<br>* As the author of Morales, failure to apply the original meaning was&para;<br>an error to which I succumbed.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

But nothing in the text or history of the Ex Post&para;<br>Facto Clause suggests that it should hinge on the expectations that prisoners and defendants have about how many&para;<br>days they will spend in prison.&para;<br>B&para;<br>“Although the Latin phrase ‘ex post facto’ literally encompasses any law passed ‘after the fact,’ ” Collins, 497&para;<br>U. S., at 41, the Court has long recognized that the phrase&para;<br>“was a term of art with an established meaning” at the&para;<br>time of the founding. Ibid. Blackstone offers the first key&para;<br>to understanding this “established meaning.” He explicitly opposed laws that rendered innocent conduct criminal after the fact. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *44&para;<br>(hereinafter Blackstone). Such laws deprive citizens of&para;<br>notice and fair warning and are, therefore, an affront to&para;<br>man’s “reason and freewill.” Id., at *39; see id., at *46.&para;<br>Blackstone, thus, considered them illegitimate. Id., at&para;<br>*44; see also The Federalist No. 44, p. 301 (J. Cooke ed.&para;<br>1961) (J. Madison) (“[E]x post facto laws . . . are contrary&para;<br>to the first principles of the social compact, and to every&para;<br>principle of sound legislation”). For this reason, ex post&para;<br>facto laws have rightly been described as “formidable&para;<br>instruments of tyranny,” id., No. 84, at 577 (A. Hamilton),&para;<br>and their prohibition a “bulwark in favour of the personal&para;<br>security of the subject,” Calder, supra, at 390 (opinion of&para;<br>Chase, J.).&para;<br>Although Blackstone confined his discussion of ex post&para;<br>facto laws to those laws retroactively declaring innocent&para;<br>acts to be criminal, other authorities confirm that laws&para;<br>retroactively increasing the punishment were also understood to be ex post facto at the time of the founding. See,&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>PEUGH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>e.g., 2 R. Wooddeson, A Systematical View of the Laws of&para;<br>England, as treated in a Course of Vinerian Lectures 638&para;<br>(1792) (discussing “acts of parliament, which principally&para;<br>affect the punishment, making therein some innovation, or&para;<br>creating some forfeiture or disability, not incurred in the&para;<br>ordinary course of law”); 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the&para;<br>Constitution of the United States §679, p. 486 (Abr. 1833)&para;<br>(The “prohibition” against ex post facto laws “reaches every&para;<br>law . . . whereby the act, if a crime, is aggravated in enormity, or punishment”). Justice Chase’s formulation reflects this understanding. Calder, 3 Dall., at 390 (“Every&para;<br>law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater&para;<br>punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when&para;<br>committed” is ex post facto). Under this view, courts must&para;<br>compare the punishment affixed to the crime at the time&para;<br>of the offense with the punishment affixed at the time of&para;<br>sentencing. If the latter is harsher than the former, the&para;<br>court must apply the punishment in effect at the time of&para;<br>the offense.&para;<br>At common law, it was quite easy to identify when a law&para;<br>retroactively increased the punishment, because the criminal law generally “prescribed a particular sentence for&para;<br>each offense.” Langbein, The English Criminal Trial Jury&para;<br>on the Eve of the French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in&para;<br>England, France, Germany 1700–1900, p. 36 (A. Schioppa&para;<br>ed. 1987). In a world of determinate sentencing, a retroactive increase in the punishment affixed to a crime renders an act “punishable in a manner in which it was not&para;<br>punishable when it was committed,” Fletcher v. Peck, 6&para;<br>Cranch 87, 138 (1810), which is sufficient for an ex post&para;<br>facto violation. The key point is that “the ex post facto&para;<br>[C]lause looks to the standard of punishment prescribed&para;<br>by a statute, rather than to the sentence actually imposed.” Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397, 401 (1937).&para;<br>Focusing on the punishment affixed by law, rather than&para;<br>on the specific sentence imposed, furthers the goals of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

Because&para;<br>increasing the punishment affixed to the crime deprives&para;<br>people of the opportunity to plan their conduct in light of&para;<br>the law, “[t]he enhancement of a crime, or penalty, seems&para;<br>to come within the same mischief as the creation of a&para;<br>crime or penalty; and therefore they may be classed together.” Calder, supra, at 397 (opinion of Paterson, J.).&para;<br>Retroactive laws that merely create a risk that a defendant will receive a higher sentence, however, do not&para;<br>implicate traditional ex post facto concerns. An individual&para;<br>contemplating the commission of a given offense knows he&para;<br>may be sentenced anywhere within the legally prescribed&para;<br>range. He may hope to receive a lenient sentence, and he&para;<br>may even have good reasons for expecting leniency. But&para;<br>he does not have any guarantees. See Garner, 529 U.

The law&para;<br>provides the defendant with only one assurance: He will&para;<br>be sentenced within the range affixed to his offense by&para;<br>statute. Legal changes that alter the likelihood of a particular sentence within the legally prescribed range do not&para;<br>deprive people of notice and fair warning, or implicate the&para;<br>concerns about tyranny that animated the adoption of&para;<br>the Ex Post Facto Clause.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The statutory range in effect at the time of petitioner’s&para;<br>offense remained in effect at his sentencing. The Guide-&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>PEUGH v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>lines sentencing range is not the punishment affixed to the&para;<br>offense. See in Part I–A, supra. Accordingly, sentencing&para;<br>petitioner under the amended Guidelines did not violate&para;<br>the Ex Post Facto Clause. Because the Court concludes&para;<br>otherwise, I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.
