SPISAK&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–724.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 13, 2009—Decided January 12, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>After the Ohio courts sentenced respondent Spisak to death and denied&para;<br>his claims on direct appeal and collateral review, he filed a federal&para;<br>habeas petition claiming that, at his trial’s penalty phase, (1) the in&para;<br>structions and verdict forms unconstitutionally required the jury to&para;<br>consider in mitigation only those factors that it unanimously found to&para;<br>be mitigating, see Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367, and (2) his coun&para;<br>sel’s inadequate closing argument deprived him of effective assis&para;<br>tance of counsel, see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668. The&para;<br>District Court denied the petition, but the Sixth Circuit accepted both&para;<br>arguments and ordered relief.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Because the state court’s upholding of the mitigation jury in&para;<br>structions and forms was not “contrary to, or . . . an unreasonable ap&para;<br>plication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this]&para;<br>Court,” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1), the Sixth Circuit was barred from&para;<br>reaching a contrary decision. The Court of Appeals erred in holding&para;<br>that the instructions and forms contravened Mills, in which this&para;<br>Court held that the jury instructions and verdict forms at issue vio&para;<br>lated the Constitution because, read naturally, they told the jury that&para;<br>it could not find a particular circumstance to be mitigating unless all&para;<br>12 jurors agreed that the mitigating circumstance had been proved to&para;<br>exist, 486 U. S., at 380–381, 384. Even assuming that Mills sets&para;<br>forth the pertinent “clearly established Federal law” for reviewing the&para;<br>state-court decision in this case, the instructions and forms used here&para;<br>differ significantly from those in Mills: They made clear that, to rec&para;<br>ommend a death sentence, the jury had to find unanimously that&para;<br>each of the aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating circum&para;<br>stances, but they did not say that the jury had to determine the exis&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. SPISAK&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tence of each individual mitigating factor unanimously. Nor did they&para;<br>say anything about how—or even whether—the jury should make in&para;<br>dividual determinations that each particular mitigating circumstance&para;<br>existed. They focused only on the overall question of balancing the&para;<br>aggravating and mitigating factors, and they repeatedly told the jury&para;<br>to consider all relevant evidence. Thus, the instructions and verdict&para;<br>forms did not clearly bring about, either through what they said or&para;<br>what they implied, the constitutional error in the Mills instructions.&para;<br>Pp. 2–9.&para;<br>2. Similarly, the state-court decision rejecting Spisak’s ineffective&para;<br>assistance-of-counsel claim was not “contrary to, or . . . an unreason&para;<br>able application” of the law “clearly established” in Strickland.&para;<br>§2254(d)(1). To prevail on this claim, Spisak must show, inter alia,&para;<br>that there is a “reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unpro&para;<br>fessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been differ&para;<br>ent.” Strickland, supra, at 694. Even assuming that the closing ar&para;<br>gument was inadequate in the respects claimed by Spisak, this Court&para;<br>finds no “reasonable probability” that a better closing argument&para;<br>without these defects would have made a significant difference. Any&para;<br>different, more adequate closing argument would have taken place in&para;<br>the following context: Spisak’s defense at the trial’s guilt phase con&para;<br>sisted of an effort by counsel to show that Spisak was not guilty by&para;<br>reason of insanity. Counsel, apparently hoping to demonstrate&para;<br>Spisak’s mentally defective condition, called him to the stand, where&para;<br>he freely admitted committing three murders and two other shoot&para;<br>ings and repeatedly expressed an intention to commit further mur&para;<br>ders if given the opportunity. In light of this background and for the&para;<br>following reasons, the assumed closing argument deficiencies do not&para;<br>raise the requisite reasonable probability of a different result but for&para;<br>the deficient closing. First, since the sentencing phase took place&para;<br>immediately after the guilt phase, the jurors had fresh in their minds&para;<br>the government’s extensive and graphic evidence regarding the kill&para;<br>ings, Spisak’s boastful and unrepentant confessions, and his threats&para;<br>to commit further violent acts. Second, although counsel did not&para;<br>summarize the mitigating evidence in great detail, he did refer to it,&para;<br>and the defense experts’ more detailed testimony regarding Spisak’s&para;<br>mental illness was also fresh in the jurors’ minds. Third, Spisak does&para;<br>not describe what other mitigating factors counsel might have men&para;<br>tioned; all those he proposes essentially consist of aspects of the&para;<br>“mental defect” factor that the defense experts described. Finally, in&para;<br>light of counsel’s several appeals to the jurors’ sense of humanity, it&para;<br>is unlikely that a more explicit or elaborate appeal for mercy could&para;<br>have changed the result, either alone or together with the foregoing&para;<br>circumstances. The Court need not reach Spisak’s claim that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>§2254(d)(1) does not apply to his claim, because it would reach the&para;<br>same conclusion even on de novo review.

Spisak, Jr., the respondent, was convicted in&para;<br>an Ohio trial court of three murders and two attempted&para;<br>murders. He was sentenced to death. He filed a habeas&para;<br>corpus petition in federal court, claiming that constitu&para;<br>tional errors occurred at his trial. First, Spisak claimed&para;<br>that the jury instructions at the penalty phase unconstitu&para;<br>tionally required the jury to consider in mitigation only&para;<br>those factors that the jury unanimously found to be miti&para;<br>gating. See Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988).&para;<br>Second, Spisak claimed that he suffered significant harm&para;<br>as a result of his counsel’s inadequate closing argument at&para;<br>the penalty phase of the proceeding. See Strickland v.&para;<br>Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). The Federal Court of&para;<br>Appeals accepted these arguments and ordered habeas&para;<br>relief. We now reverse the Court of Appeals.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 1983, an Ohio jury convicted Spisak of three murders&para;<br>and two attempted murders at Cleveland State University&para;<br>in 1982. The jury recommended, and the judge imposed, a&para;<br>death sentence. The Ohio courts denied Spisak’s claims,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. SPISAK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>both on direct appeal and on collateral review. State v.&para;<br>Spisak, 36 Ohio St. 3d 80, 521 N. E. 2d 800 (1988) (per&para;<br>curiam); State v. Spisak, No. 67229, 1995 WL 229108&para;<br>(Ohio App., 8th Dist., Cuyahoga Cty., Apr. 13, 1995); State&para;<br>v. Spisak, 73 Ohio St. 3d 151, 652 N. E. 2d 719 (1995) (per&para;<br>curiam).&para;<br>Spisak then sought a federal writ of habeas corpus.&para;<br>Among other claims, he argued that the sentencing phase&para;<br>of his trial violated the U. S. Constitution for the two&para;<br>reasons we consider here. The District Court denied his&para;<br>petition. Spisak v. Coyle, Case No. 1:95CV2675 (ND Ohio,&para;<br>Apr. 18, 2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a. But the Court of&para;<br>Appeals accepted Spisak’s two claims, namely, his mitiga&para;<br>tion instruction claim and his ineffective-assistance-of&para;<br>counsel claim. Spisak v. Mitchell, 465 F. 3d 684, 703–706,&para;<br>708–711 (CA6 2006). The Court of Appeals consequently&para;<br>ordered the District Court to issue a conditional writ of&para;<br>habeas corpus forbidding Spisak’s execution. Id., at 715–&para;<br>716.&para;<br>The State of Ohio then sought certiorari in this Court.&para;<br>We granted the petition and vacated the Court of Appeals’&para;<br>judgment. Hudson v. Spisak, 552 U. S. 945 (2007). We&para;<br>remanded the case for further consideration in light of two&para;<br>recent cases in which this Court had held that lower fed&para;<br>eral courts had not properly taken account of the defer&para;<br>ence federal law grants state-court determinations on&para;<br>federal habeas review. Ibid.; see 28 U. S. C. §2254(d);&para;<br>Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70 (2006); Schriro v. Landri&para;<br>gan, 550 U. S. 465 (2007). On remand, the Sixth Circuit&para;<br>reinstated its earlier opinion. Spisak v. Hudson, 512 F. 3d&para;<br>852, 853–854 (2008). The State again sought certiorari.&para;<br>We again granted the petition. And we now reverse.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Spisak’s first claim concerns the instructions and verdict&para;<br>forms that the jury received at the sentencing phase of his&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>trial. The Court of Appeals held the sentencing instruc&para;<br>tions unconstitutional because, in its view, the instruc&para;<br>tions, taken together with the forms, “require[d]” juror&para;<br>“unanimity as to the presence of a mitigating factor”—&para;<br>contrary to this Court’s holding in Mills v. Maryland,&para;<br>supra. 465 F. 3d, at 708. Since the parties do not dispute&para;<br>that the Ohio courts “adjudicated” this claim, i.e., they&para;<br>considered and rejected it “on the merits,” the law permits&para;<br>a federal court to reach a contrary decision only if the&para;<br>state-court decision “was contrary to, or involved an un&para;<br>reasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,&para;<br>as determined by the Supreme Court of the United&para;<br>States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). Unlike the Court of&para;<br>Appeals, we conclude that Spisak’s claim does not satisfy&para;<br>this standard.&para;<br>The parties, like the Court of Appeals, assume that&para;<br>Mills sets forth the pertinent “clearly established Federal&para;<br>law.” While recognizing some uncertainty as to whether&para;<br>Mills was “clearly established Federal law” for the purpose&para;<br>of reviewing the Ohio Supreme Court’s opinion, we shall&para;<br>assume the same. Compare Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S.&para;<br>362, 390 (2000) (STEVENS, J., for the Court) (applicable&para;<br>date for purposes of determining whether “Federal law” is&para;<br>“established” is when the “state-court conviction became&para;<br>final”), with id., at 412 (O’Connor, J., for the Court) (appli&para;<br>cable date is “the time of the relevant state-court deci&para;<br>sion”); see State v. Spisak, 36 Ohio St. 3d 80, 521 N. E. 2d&para;<br>800 (decided Apr. 13, 1988), cert. denied, 489 U. S. 1071&para;<br>(decided Mar. 6, 1989); Mills v. Maryland, supra (decided&para;<br>June 6, 1988).&para;<br>A&para;<br>The rule the Court set forth in Mills is based on two&para;<br>well-established principles. First, the Constitution forbids&para;<br>imposition of the death penalty if the sentencing judge or&para;<br>jury is “ ‘ “precluded from considering, as a mitigating&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. SPISAK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>factor, any aspect of a defendant’s character or record and&para;<br>any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant&para;<br>proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.” ’ ” 486&para;<br>U. S., at 374 (quoting Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104,&para;<br>110 (1982), in turn quoting Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586,&para;<br>604 (1978) (plurality opinion)). Second, the sentencing&para;<br>judge or jury “ ‘ may not refuse to consider or be precluded&para;<br>from considering “any relevant mitigating evidence.” ’ ”&para;<br>Mills, 486 U. S., at 374–375 (quoting Skipper v. South&para;<br>Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 4 (1986), in turn quoting Eddings,&para;<br>supra, at 114).&para;<br>Applying these principles, the Court held that the jury&para;<br>instructions and verdict forms at issue in the case violated&para;<br>the Constitution because, read naturally, they told the&para;<br>jury that it could not find a particular circumstance to be&para;<br>mitigating unless all 12 jurors agreed that the mitigating&para;<br>circumstance had been proved to exist. Mills, 486 U. S., at&para;<br>380–381, 384. If, for example, the defense presents evi&para;<br>dence of three potentially mitigating considerations, some&para;<br>jurors may believe that only the first is mitigating, some&para;<br>only the second, and some only the third. But if even one&para;<br>of the jurors believes that one of the three mitigating&para;<br>considerations exists, but that he is barred from consider&para;<br>ing it because the other jurors disagree, the Court held,&para;<br>the Constitution forbids imposition of the death penalty.&para;<br>See id., at 380, 384; see also McKoy v. North Carolina, 494&para;<br>U. S. 433, 442–443 (1990) (“Mills requires that each juror&para;<br>be permitted to consider and give effect to . . . all mitigat&para;<br>ing evidence in deciding . . . whether aggravating circum&para;<br>stances outweigh mitigating circumstances . . . ”). Because&para;<br>the instructions in Mills would have led a reasonable juror&para;<br>to believe the contrary, the Court held that the sentencing&para;<br>proceeding violated the Constitution. 486 U. S., at 374–&para;<br>375.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010) &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>&para;<br>In evaluating the Court of Appeals’ determination here,&para;<br>we have examined the jury instructions and verdict forms&para;<br>at issue in Mills and compared them with those used in&para;<br>the present case. In the Mills sentencing phase, the trial&para;<br>judge instructed the jury to fill out a verdict form that had&para;<br>three distinct parts. Section I set forth a list of 10 specific&para;<br>aggravating circumstances next to which were spaces&para;<br>where the jury was to mark “yes” or “no.” Just above the&para;<br>list, the form said:&para;<br>“Based upon the evidence we unanimously find that&para;<br>each of the following aggravating circumstances which&para;<br>is marked ‘yes’ has been proven . . . and each aggra&para;<br>vating circumstance which is marked ‘no’ has not been&para;<br>proven . . . .” 486 U. S., at 384–385 (emphasis added;&para;<br>internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Section II set forth a list of eight potentially mitigating&para;<br>circumstances (seven specific circumstances and the&para;<br>eighth designated as “other”) next to which were spaces&para;<br>where the jury was to mark “yes” or “no.” Just above the&para;<br>list the form said:&para;<br>“Based upon the evidence we unanimously find that&para;<br>each of the following mitigating circumstances which&para;<br>is marked ‘yes’ has been proven to exist . . . and each&para;<br>mitigating circumstance marked ‘no’ has not been&para;<br>proven . . . .” Id., at 387 (emphasis added; internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Section III set forth the overall balancing question, along&para;<br>with spaces for the jury to mark “yes” or “no.” It said:&para;<br>“Based on the evidence we unanimously find that it&para;<br>has been proven . . . that the mitigating circumstances&para;<br>marked ‘yes’ in Section II outweigh the aggravating&para;<br>circumstances marked ‘yes’ in Section I.” Id., at 388–&para;<br>389 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omit&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. SPISAK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ted).&para;<br>Explaining the forms, the judge instructed the jury with&para;<br>an example. He told the jury that it should mark “ ‘yes’ ”&para;<br>on the jury form if it “ ‘unanimously’ ” concluded that an&para;<br>aggravating circumstance had been proved. Id., at 378.&para;<br>Otherwise, he said, “ ‘of course you must answer no.’ ”&para;<br>Ibid. (emphasis deleted). These instructions, together&para;<br>with the forms, told the jury to mark “yes” on Section II’s&para;<br>list of mitigating factors only if the jury unanimously&para;<br>concluded that the particular mitigating factor had been&para;<br>proved, and to consider in its weighing analysis in Section&para;<br>III only those mitigating factors marked “yes” in Section&para;<br>II. Thus, as this Court found, the jury was instructed that&para;<br>it could consider in the ultimate weighing of the aggravat&para;<br>ing and mitigating evidence only the mitigating factors&para;<br>that the jury had unanimously found to exist. See id., at&para;<br>380–381.&para;<br>The instructions and jury forms in this case differ sig&para;<br>nificantly from those in Mills. The trial judge instructed&para;<br>the jury that the aggravating factors they would consider&para;<br>were the specifications that the jury had found proved&para;<br>beyond a reasonable doubt at the guilt phase of the trial—&para;<br>essentially, that each murder was committed in a course of&para;<br>conduct including the other crimes, and, for two of the&para;<br>murders, that the murder was committed with the intent&para;<br>to evade apprehension or punishment for another offense.&para;<br>8 Tr. 2967–2972 (July 19, 1983).&para;<br>He then explained the concept of a “mitigating factor.”&para;<br>After doing so, he listed examples, including that “the&para;<br>defendant because of a mental disease or defect . . . lacked&para;<br>substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his&para;<br>conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of&para;<br>the law.” Id., at 2972–2973. The court also told the jury&para;<br>that it could take account of “any other” mitigating consid&para;<br>eration it found “relevant to the issue of whether the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>defendant should be sentenced to death.” Id., at 2973.&para;<br>And he instructed the jury that the State bore the burden&para;<br>of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating&para;<br>circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors. Id., at&para;<br>2965.&para;<br>With respect to “the procedure” by which the jury should&para;<br>reach its verdict, the judge told the jury only the following:&para;<br>“[Y]ou, the trial jury, must consider all of the relevant&para;<br>evidence raised at trial, the evidence and testimony&para;<br>received in this hearing and the arguments of counsel.&para;<br>From this you must determine whether, beyond a rea&para;<br>sonable doubt, the aggravating circumstances, which&para;<br>[Spisak] has been found guilty of committing in the&para;<br>separate counts are sufficient to outweigh the mitigat&para;<br>ing factors present in this case.&para;<br>“If all twelve members of the jury find by proof be&para;<br>yond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circum&para;<br>stance in each separate count outweighs the mitigat&para;<br>ing factors, then you must return that finding to the&para;<br>Court.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>“On the other hand, if after considering all of the&para;<br>relevant evidence raised at trial, the evidence and the&para;<br>testimony received at this hearing and the arguments&para;<br>of counsel, you find that the State failed to prove be&para;<br>yond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circum&para;<br>stances which [Spisak] has been found guilty of com&para;<br>mitting in the separate counts outweigh the&para;<br>mitigating factors, you will then proceed to determine&para;<br>which of two possible life imprisonment sentences to&para;<br>recommend to the Court.” Id., at 2973–2975.&para;<br>The judge gave the jury two verdict forms for each ag&para;<br>gravating factor. The first of the two forms said:&para;<br>“ ‘We the jury in this case . . . do find beyond a reason&para;<br>able doubt that the aggravating circumstance . . . was&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. SPISAK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors present&para;<br>&para;<br>in this case.&para;<br>&para;<br>“ ‘We the jury recommend that the sentence of death &para;<br>&para;<br>be imposed . . . .’ ” Id., at 2975–2976. &para;<br>&para;<br>The other verdict form read:&para;<br>“ ‘We the jury . . . do find that the aggravating circum&para;<br>stances . . . are not sufficient to outweigh the mitiga&para;<br>tion factors present in this case.&para;<br>“ ‘We the jury recommend that the defendant . . . be&para;<br>sentenced to life imprisonment . . . .’ ” Id., at 2976.&para;<br>The instructions and forms made clear that, to recom&para;<br>mend a death sentence, the jury had to find, unanimously&para;<br>and beyond a reasonable doubt, that each of the aggravat&para;<br>ing factors outweighed any mitigating circumstances. But&para;<br>the instructions did not say that the jury must determine&para;<br>the existence of each individual mitigating factor unani&para;<br>mously. Neither the instructions nor the forms said any&para;<br>thing about how—or even whether—the jury should make&para;<br>individual determinations that each particular mitigating&para;<br>circumstance existed. They focused only on the overall&para;<br>balancing question. And the instructions repeatedly told&para;<br>the jury to “conside[r] all of the relevant evidence.” Id., at&para;<br>2974. In our view the instructions and verdict forms did&para;<br>not clearly bring about, either through what they said or&para;<br>what they implied, the circumstance that Mills found&para;<br>critical, namely,&para;<br>“a substantial possibility that reasonable jurors, upon&para;<br>receiving the judge’s instructions in this case, and in&para;<br>attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed,&para;<br>well may have thought they were precluded from con&para;<br>sidering any mitigating evidence unless all 12 jurors&para;<br>agreed on the existence of a particular such circum&para;<br>stance.” 486 U. S., at 384.&para;<br>We consequently conclude that that the state court’s deci&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sion upholding these forms and instructions was not “con&para;<br>trary to, or . . . an unreasonable application of, clearly&para;<br>established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme&para;<br>Court of the United States” in Mills.&para;<br>28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254(d)(1).&para;<br>We add that the Court of Appeals found the jury in&para;<br>structions unconstitutional for an additional reason, that&para;<br>the instructions “require[d] the jury to unanimously reject&para;<br>a death sentence before considering other sentencing&para;<br>alternatives.” 465 F. 3d, at 709 (citing Maples v. Coyle,&para;<br>171 F. 3d 408, 416–417 (CA6 1999)). We have not, how&para;<br>ever, previously held jury instructions unconstitutional for&para;<br>this reason. Mills says nothing about the matter. Neither&para;<br>the parties nor the courts below referred to Beck v. Ala&para;<br>bama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980), or identified any other prece&para;<br>dent from this Court setting forth this rule. Cf. Jones v.&para;<br>United States, 527 U. S. 373, 379–384 (1999) (rejecting an&para;<br>arguably analogous claim). But see post, at 3–5 (STEVENS,&para;<br>J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). What&para;<br>ever the legal merits of the rule or the underlying verdict&para;<br>forms in this case were we to consider them on direct&para;<br>appeal, the jury instructions at Spisak’s trial were not&para;<br>contrary to “clearly established Federal law.” 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254(d)(1).&para;<br>III&para;<br>Spisak’s second claim is that his counsel’s closing argu&para;<br>ment at the sentencing phase of his trial was so inade&para;<br>quate as to violate the Sixth Amendment. To prevail,&para;<br>Spisak must show both that “counsel’s representation fell&para;<br>below an objective standard of reasonableness,” Strick&para;<br>land, 466 U. S., at 688, and that there is a “reasonable&para;<br>probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors,&para;<br>the result of the proceeding would have been different,”&para;<br>id., at 694.&para;<br>The Ohio Supreme Court held that Spisak’s claim was&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. SPISAK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“not well-taken on the basis of our review of the record.”&para;<br>State v. Spisak, 36 Ohio St. 3d, at 82, 521 N. E. 2d, at 802&para;<br>(citing, inter alia, Strickland, supra). The District Court&para;<br>concluded that counsel did a constitutionally adequate job&para;<br>and that “[t]here simply is not a reasonable probability&para;<br>that, absent counsel’s alleged errors, the jury would have&para;<br>concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating&para;<br>circumstances did not warrant death.” Spisak v. Coyle,&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 204a. The Court of Appeals, how&para;<br>ever, reached a contrary conclusion. It held that counsel’s&para;<br>closing argument, measured by “ ‘an objective standard of&para;<br>reasonableness,’ ” was inadequate, and it asserted that “a&para;<br>reasonable probability exists ” that adequate representa&para;<br>tion would have led to a different result. 465 F. 3d, at 703,&para;<br>706 (quoting Strickland, supra, at 688). Responding to the&para;<br>State’s petition for certiorari, we agreed to review the&para;<br>Court of Appeals’ terse finding of a “reasonable probabil&para;<br>ity” that a more adequate argument would have changed a&para;<br>juror’s vote.&para;<br>In his closing argument at the penalty phase, Spisak’s&para;<br>counsel described Spisak’s killings in some detail. He&para;<br>acknowledged that Spisak’s admiration for Hitler inspired&para;<br>his crimes. He portrayed Spisak as “sick,” “twisted,” and&para;<br>“demented.” 8 Tr. 2896 (July 19, 1983). And he said that&para;<br>Spisak was “never going to be any different.” Ibid. He&para;<br>then pointed out that all the experts had testified that&para;<br>Spisak suffered from some degree of mental illness. And,&para;<br>after a fairly lengthy and rambling disquisition about his&para;<br>own decisions about calling expert witnesses and prepar&para;<br>ing them, counsel argued that, even if Spisak was not&para;<br>legally insane so as to warrant a verdict of not guilty by&para;<br>reason of insanity, he nonetheless was sufficiently men&para;<br>tally ill to lessen his culpability to the point where he&para;<br>should not be executed. Counsel also told the jury that,&para;<br>when weighing Spisak’s mental illness against the “sub&para;<br>stantial” aggravating factors present in the case, id., at&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>2924, the jurors should draw on their own sense of “pride”&para;<br>for living in “a humane society” made up of “a humane&para;<br>people,” id., at 2897–2900, 2926–2928. That humanity,&para;<br>he said, required the jury to weigh the evidence “fairly”&para;<br>and to be “loyal to that oath” the jurors had taken to up&para;<br>hold the law. Id., at 2926.&para;<br>Spisak and his supporting amici say that this argument&para;<br>was constitutionally inadequate because: (1) It overly&para;<br>emphasized the gruesome nature of the killings; (2) it&para;<br>overly emphasized Spisak’s threats to continue his crimes;&para;<br>(3) it understated the facts upon which the experts based&para;<br>their mental illness conclusions; (4) it said little or nothing&para;<br>about any other possible mitigating circumstance; and (5)&para;<br>it made no explicit request that the jury return a verdict&para;<br>against death.&para;<br>We assume for present purposes that Spisak is correct&para;<br>that the closing argument was inadequate. We neverthe&para;<br>less find no “reasonable probability” that a better closing&para;<br>argument without these defects would have made a sig&para;<br>nificant difference.&para;<br>Any different, more adequate closing argument would&para;<br>have taken place in the following context: Spisak admitted&para;<br>that he had committed three murders and two other shoot&para;<br>ings. Spisak’s defense at the guilt phase of the trial con&para;<br>sisted of an effort by counsel to show that Spisak was not&para;<br>guilty by reason of insanity. And counsel, apparently&para;<br>hoping to demonstrate Spisak’s mentally defective condi&para;<br>tion, called him to the stand.&para;<br>Spisak testified that he had shot and killed Horace&para;<br>Rickerson, Timothy Sheehan, and Brian Warford. He also&para;<br>admitted that he had shot and tried to kill John Har&para;<br>daway, and shot at Coletta Dartt. He committed these&para;<br>crimes, he said, because he was a follower of Adolf Hitler,&para;<br>who was Spisak’s “spiritual leader” in a “war” for “sur&para;<br>vival” of “the Aryan people.” 4 id., at 1343–1344, 1396&para;<br>(July 5, 1983). He said that he had purchased guns and&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. SPISAK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>stockpiled ammunition to further this war. Id., at 1406–&para;<br>1408. And he had hoped to “create terror” at Cleveland&para;<br>State University, because it was “one of the prime targets”&para;<br>where the “Jews and the system . . . are brainwashing the&para;<br>youth.” Id., at 1426–1428.&para;<br>Spisak then said that in February 1982 he had shot&para;<br>Rickerson, who was black, because Rickerson had made a&para;<br>sexual advance on Spisak in a university bathroom. He&para;<br>expressed satisfaction at having “eliminated that particu&para;<br>lar threat . . . to me and to the white race.” 5 id., at 1511&para;<br>(July 7, 1983). In June he saw a stranger, John Har&para;<br>daway, on a train platform and shot him seven times&para;<br>because he had been looking for a black person to kill as&para;<br>“blood atonement” for a recent crime against two white&para;<br>women. 4 id., at 1416 (July 5, 1983). He added that he&para;<br>felt “good” after shooting Hardaway because he had “ac&para;<br>complished something,” but later felt “[k]ind of bad” when&para;<br>he learned that Hardaway had survived. Id., at 1424–&para;<br>1425. In August 1982, Spisak shot at Coletta Dartt be&para;<br>cause, he said, he heard her “making some derisive re&para;<br>marks about us,” meaning the Nazi Party. Id., at 1432–&para;<br>1435. Later that August, he shot and killed Timothy&para;<br>Sheehan because he “thought he was one of those Jewish&para;<br>professors . . . that liked to hang around in the men’s room&para;<br>and seduce and pervert and subvert the young people that&para;<br>go there.” 5 id., at 1465–1466 (July 7, 1983). Spisak&para;<br>added that he was “sorry about that” murder because he&para;<br>later learned Sheehan “wasn’t Jewish like I thought he&para;<br>was.” Ibid. And three days later, while on a “search and&para;<br>destroy mission,” he shot and killed Brian Warford, a&para;<br>young black man who “looked like he was almost asleep”&para;<br>in a bus shelter, to fulfill his “duty” to “inflict the maxi&para;<br>mum amount of casualties on the enemies.” Id., at 1454–&para;<br>1455, 1478.&para;<br>Spisak also testified that he would continue to commit&para;<br>similar crimes if he had the chance. He said about War&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ford’s murder that he “didn’t want to get caught that time&para;<br>because I wanted to be able to do it again and again and&para;<br>again and again.” Id., at 1699 (July 8, 1983). In a letter&para;<br>written to a friend, he called the murders of Rickerson and&para;<br>Warford “the finest thing I ever did in my whole life” and&para;<br>expressed a wish that he “had a human submachine gun&para;<br>right now so I could exterminate” black men “and watch&para;<br>them scream and twitch in agony.” Id., at 1724–1725.&para;<br>And he testified that, if he still had his guns, he would&para;<br>escape from jail, “go out and continue the war I started,”&para;<br>and “continue to inflict the maximum amount of damage&para;<br>on the enemies as I am able to do.” Id., at 1780–1781.&para;<br>The State replied by attempting to show that Spisak&para;<br>was lying in his testimony about the Nazi-related motives&para;<br>for these crimes. The State contended instead that the&para;<br>shootings were motivated by less unusual purposes, such&para;<br>as robbery. See id., at 1680, 1816–1818.&para;<br>The defense effort to show that Spisak was not guilty by&para;<br>reason of insanity foundered when the trial judge refused&para;<br>to instruct the jury to consider that question and excluded&para;<br>expert testimony regarding Spisak’s mental state. The&para;<br>defense’s expert witness, Dr. Oscar Markey, had written a&para;<br>report diagnosing Spisak as suffering from a “schizotypal&para;<br>personality disorder” and an “atypical psychotic disorder,”&para;<br>and as, at times, “unable to control his impulses to as&para;<br>sault.” 6 id., at 1882–1883, 1992 (July 11, 1983). His&para;<br>testimony was somewhat more ambiguous during a voir&para;<br>dire, however. On cross-examination, he conceded that he&para;<br>could not say Spisak failed Ohio’s sanity standard at the&para;<br>time of the murders. After Markey made the same conces&para;<br>sion before the jury, the court granted the prosecution’s&para;<br>renewed motion to exclude Markey’s testimony and in&para;<br>structed the jury to disregard the testimony that it heard.&para;<br>And the court excluded the defense’s proffered reports&para;<br>from other psychologists and psychiatrists who examined&para;<br>Spisak, because none of the reports said that Spisak met&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. SPISAK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the Ohio insanity standard at the time of the crimes. Id.,&para;<br>at 1898–1899, 1911–1912, 1995; id., at 2017, 2022 (July&para;<br>12, 1983).&para;<br>During the sentencing phase of the proceedings, defense&para;<br>counsel called three expert witnesses, all of whom testified&para;<br>that Spisak suffered from some degree of mental illness.&para;<br>Dr. Sandra McPherson, a clinical psychologist, said that&para;<br>Spisak suffered from schizotypal and borderline personal&para;<br>ity disorders characterized by bizarre and paranoid think&para;<br>ing, gender identification conflict, and emotional instabil&para;<br>ity. She added that these defects “substantially impair his&para;<br>ability to conform himself” to the law’s requirements. 8&para;<br>id., at 2428–2429, 2430–2441 (July 16, 1983). Dr. Kurt&para;<br>Bertschinger, a psychiatrist, testified that Spisak suffered&para;<br>from a schizotypal personality disorder and that “mental&para;<br>illness does impair his reason to the extent that he has&para;<br>substantial inability to know wrongfulness, or substantial&para;<br>inability to refrain.” Id., at 2552–2556. Dr. Markey,&para;<br>whose testimony had been stricken at the guilt phase,&para;<br>again testified and agreed with the other experts’ diagno&para;<br>ses. Id., at 2692–2693, 2712–2713 (July 18, 1983).&para;<br>In light of this background and for the following rea&para;<br>sons, we do not find that the assumed deficiencies in&para;<br>defense counsel’s closing argument raise “a reasonable&para;<br>probability that,” but for the deficient closing, “the result&para;<br>of the proceeding would have been different.” Strickland,&para;<br>466 U. S., at 694. We therefore cannot find the Ohio&para;<br>Supreme Court’s decision rejecting Spisak’s ineffective&para;<br>assistance-of-counsel claim to be an “unreasonable appli&para;<br>cation” of the law “clearly established” in Strickland.&para;<br>§2254(d)(1).&para;<br>First, since the sentencing phase took place immediately&para;<br>following the conclusion of the guilt phase, the jurors had&para;<br>fresh in their minds the government’s evidence regarding&para;<br>the killings—which included photographs of the dead&para;<br>bodies, images that formed the basis of defense counsel’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>vivid descriptions of the crimes—as well as Spisak’s boast&para;<br>ful and unrepentant confessions and his threats to commit&para;<br>further acts of violence. We therefore do not see how a&para;<br>less descriptive closing argument with fewer disparaging&para;<br>comments about Spisak could have made a significant&para;<br>difference.&para;<br>Similarly fresh in the jurors’ minds was the three de&para;<br>fense experts’ testimony that Spisak suffered from mental&para;<br>illness. The jury had heard the experts explain the spe&para;<br>cific facts upon which they had based their conclusions, as&para;<br>well as what they had learned of his family background&para;<br>and his struggles with gender identity. And the jury had&para;<br>heard the experts draw connections between his mental&para;<br>illness and the crimes. We do not see how it could have&para;<br>made a significant difference had counsel gone beyond his&para;<br>actual argument—which emphasized mental illness as a&para;<br>mitigating factor and referred the jury to the experts’&para;<br>testimony—by repeating the facts or connections that the&para;<br>experts had just described.&para;<br>Nor does Spisak tell us what other mitigating factors&para;<br>counsel might have mentioned. All those he proposes&para;<br>essentially consist of aspects of the “mental defect” factor&para;<br>that the defense experts described.&para;<br>Finally, in light of counsel’s several appeals to the ju&para;<br>rors’ sense of humanity—he used the words “humane&para;<br>people” and “humane society” 10 times at various points in&para;<br>the argument—we cannot find that a more explicit or&para;<br>more elaborate appeal for mercy could have changed the&para;<br>result, either alone or together with the other circum&para;<br>stances just discussed. Thus, we conclude that there is not&para;<br>a reasonable probability that a more adequate closing&para;<br>argument would have changed the result, and that the&para;<br>Ohio Supreme Court’s rejection of Spisak’s claim was not&para;<br>“contrary to, or . . . an unreasonable application of” Strick&para;<br>land. 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1).&para;<br>Spisak contends that the deferential standard of review&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. SPISAK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>under §2254(d)(1) should not apply to this claim because&para;<br>the Ohio Supreme Court may not have reached the ques&para;<br>tion whether counsel’s closing argument caused Spisak&para;<br>prejudice. That is, the Ohio Supreme Court’s summary&para;<br>rejection of this claim did not indicate whether that court&para;<br>rested its conclusion upon a finding (1) that counsel was&para;<br>not ineffective, or (2) that a better argument would not&para;<br>have made a difference, or (3) both. See State v. Spisak,&para;<br>36 Ohio St. 3d, at 82, 521 N. E. 2d, at 802. Spisak argues&para;<br>that, under these circumstances, a federal court should&para;<br>not defer to a state court that may not have decided a&para;<br>question, but instead should decide the matter afresh.&para;<br>Lower federal courts have rejected arguments similar to&para;<br>Spisak’s. See, e.g., Hennon v. Cooper, 109 F. 3d 330, 334–&para;<br>335 (CA7 1997); see also Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U. S. 225,&para;<br>231, 237 (2000) (applying the §2254(d) standard in case&para;<br>involving a state court’s summary denial of a claim,&para;<br>though not a Strickland claim, and without full briefing&para;<br>regarding whether or how §2254(d) applied to a summary&para;<br>decision); Chadwick v. Janecka, 312 F. 3d 597, 605–606&para;<br>(CA3 2002) (Alito, J.) (relying on Weeks in holding that&para;<br>§2254(d) applies where a state court denies a claim on the&para;<br>merits without giving any indication how it reached its&para;<br>decision); see generally 2 R. Hertz &amp; J. Liebman, Federal&para;<br>Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure §32.2, pp. 1574–&para;<br>1579 (5th ed. 2005 and 2008 Supp.). However, we need&para;<br>not decide whether deference under §2254(d)(1) is re&para;<br>quired here. With or without such deference, our conclu&para;<br>sion is the same.&para;<br>For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals&para;<br>for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

First, the jury&para;<br>instructions impermissibly required that the jury unani&para;<br>mously reject a death sentence before considering other&para;<br>sentencing options. Second, the closing argument of&para;<br>Spisak’s counsel was so egregious that it was constitution&para;<br>ally deficient under any standard. Nevertheless, for the&para;<br>reasons set forth in Part III of the Court’s opinion, ante, at&para;<br>11–15, I agree that these errors did not prejudice Spisak&para;<br>and thus he is not entitled to relief.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The jury instructions given during Spisak’s penalty&para;<br>phase, described in the Court’s opinion, ante, at 6–8, are&para;<br>fairly read to require the jury first to consider whether the&para;<br>death penalty is warranted—i.e., whether the aggravating&para;<br>factors outweigh the mitigating factors—before moving on&para;<br>to consider whether instead a lesser penalty—i.e., one of&para;<br>two available life sentences—is appropriate. Consistent&para;<br>with Ohio law at the time of Spisak’s trial,1 the jury was&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Ohio no longer uses the type of jury instructions at issue in this&para;<br>case. In 1996 the Ohio Supreme Court instructed that “[i]n Ohio, a&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. SPISAK&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>told that it must reach its decision unanimously. The jury&para;<br>was not instructed on the consequence of their failure to&para;<br>agree unanimously that Spisak should be sentenced to&para;<br>death. Spisak and the Court of Appeals both described&para;<br>these instructions as “acquittal first” because they would&para;<br>have led a reasonable jury to believe that it first had to&para;<br>“acquit” the defendant of death—unanimously—before it&para;<br>could give effect to a lesser penalty.&para;<br>Following its prior decision in Davis v. Mitchell, 318&para;<br>F. 3d 682 (CA6 2003), in which it struck down “virtually&para;<br>identical” jury instructions, Spisak v. Mitchell, 465 F. 3d&para;<br>684, 710 (CA6 2006), the Court of Appeals concluded that&para;<br>the instructions given during Spisak’s penalty phase were&para;<br>impermissible because they “require[d] the jury to unani&para;<br>mously reject a death sentence before considering other&para;<br>sentencing alternatives,” id., at 709. In Davis, the court&para;<br>had explained that an instruction that requires a capital&para;<br>jury to “first unanimously reject the death penalty before&para;<br>it can consider a life sentence . . . precludes the individual&para;<br>jury from giving effect to mitigating evidence . . . .” 318&para;<br>F. 3d, at 689. The source of this constitutional infirmity,&para;<br>the court decided, was our decision in Mills v. Maryland,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>solitary juror may prevent a death penalty recommendation by finding&para;<br>that the aggravating circumstances in the case do not outweigh the&para;<br>mitigating factors. Jurors from this point forward should be so in&para;<br>structed.” State v. Brooks, 75 Ohio St. 3d 148, 162, 661 N. E. 2d 1030,&para;<br>1042. Although the Brooks decision signaled a change in Ohio’s capital&para;<br>jury instructions, it was not a change in state law: One juror had the&para;<br>power to prevent a death penalty recommendation before Brooks. See&para;<br>State v. Springer, 63 Ohio St. 3d 167, 172, 586 N. E. 2d 96, 100 (1992)&para;<br>(holding that an offender must be sentenced to life if the penalty-phase&para;<br>jury deadlocks). Thus, consistent with our view that “accurate sentenc&para;<br>ing information is an indispensable prerequisite to a [jury’s] determina&para;<br>tion of whether a defendant shall live or die,” Gregg v. Georgia, 428&para;<br>U. S. 153, 190 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS,&para;<br>JJ.), the Ohio high court laudably improved upon the accuracy of Ohio&para;<br>capital jury instructions in Brooks.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>486 U. S. 367 (1988). For the reasons cogently examined&para;<br>in JUSTICE BREYER’s opinion, ante, at 5–9, I agree that&para;<br>Mills does not clearly establish that the instructions at&para;<br>issue were unconstitutional. But, in my view, our decision&para;<br>in Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980), does.2&para;<br>In Beck we held that the death penalty may not be&para;<br>imposed “when the jury was not permitted to consider a&para;<br>verdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense, and&para;<br>when the evidence would have supported such a verdict.”&para;<br>Id., at 627 (internal quotation marks omitted). At that&para;<br>time, the Alabama death penalty statute had been “consis&para;<br>tently construed to preclude any lesser included offense&para;<br>instructions in capital cases.” Id., at 629, n. 3. Thus, the&para;<br>Alabama jury was “given the choice of either convicting&para;<br>the defendant of the capital crime, in which case it [was]&para;<br>required to impose the death penalty, or acquitting him,&para;<br>thus allowing him to escape all penalties for his alleged&para;<br>participation in the crime.” Id., at 628–629. Because of&para;<br>the unique features of Alabama’s capital punishment&para;<br>system,3 Beck’s jury believed that either it had to convict&para;<br>Beck, thus sending him to his death, or acquit him, thus&para;<br>setting him free. The jury was not presented with the&para;<br>“third option” of convicting him of a noncapital offense,&para;<br>thus ensuring that he would receive a substantial pun&para;<br>ishment but not receive the death penalty. Id., at 642.&para;<br>We concluded that the false choice before the jury—death&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Notably,&para;<br>&para;<br>Beck substantially predates Spisak’s trial and thus my&para;<br>application of Beck obviates any discussion on when federal law is&para;<br>established for Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996&para;<br>purposes, see ante, at 3. Regardless, in accordance with the view I&para;<br>expressed in Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 379–380 (2000) (opinion&para;<br>of STEVENS, J.), I would conclude that our decision in Mills, decided&para;<br>before Spisak’s conviction became final, is also available to him.&para;<br>3 Under Alabama law, the judge conducts a separate penalty-phase&para;<br>proceeding after the jury has returned a conviction on a capital offense.&para;<br>Beck, 447 U. S., at 629. Thus, the jury reasonably believed that its&para;<br>verdict would set the defendant’s punishment at death.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. SPISAK&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>or acquit—“introduce[d] a level of uncertainty and unreli&para;<br>ability into the factfinding process that cannot be tolerated&para;<br>in a capital case.” Id., at 643. In other words,&para;<br>“the difficulty with the Alabama statute is that it in&para;<br>terjects irrelevant considerations into the factfinding&para;<br>process, diverting the jury’s attention from the central&para;<br>issue of whether the State has satisfied its burden of&para;<br>proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant&para;<br>is guilty of a capital crime. Thus, on the one hand, the&para;<br>unavailability of the third option of convicting on a&para;<br>lesser included offense may encourage the jury to con&para;<br>vict for an impermissible reason—its belief that the&para;<br>defendant is guilty of some serious crime and should&para;<br>be punished. On the other hand, the apparently&para;<br>mandatory nature of the death penalty may encour&para;<br>age it to acquit for an equally impermissible reason—&para;<br>that, whatever his crime, the defendant does not de&para;<br>serve death.” Id., at 642–643.&para;<br>Although Beck dealt with guilt-phase instructions, the&para;<br>reach of its holding is not so limited. The “third option” we&para;<br>discussed in Beck was, plainly, a life sentence. Moreover,&para;<br>the unusual features of the Alabama capital sentencing&para;<br>scheme collapsed the guilt and penalty phases before the&para;<br>jury (but not before the judge). Our concern in Beck was&para;<br>that presenting the jury with only two options—death or&para;<br>no punishment—introduced a risk of arbitrariness and&para;<br>error into the deliberative process that the Constitution&para;<br>could not abide in the capital context. See Spaziano v.&para;<br>Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 455 (1984) (“The goal of the Beck&para;<br>rule, in other words, is to eliminate the distortion of the&para;<br>factfinding process that is created when the jury is forced&para;<br>into an all-or-nothing choice between capital murder and&para;<br>innocence”). We held, therefore, that the jury must be&para;<br>given a meaningful opportunity to consider and embrace&para;<br>the equivalent of a life-sentence when the evidence sup&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>ports such an option.&para;<br>The acquittal-first jury instructions used during&para;<br>Spisak’s penalty phase interposed before the jury the same&para;<br>false choice that our holding in Beck prohibits. By requir&para;<br>ing Spisak’s jury to decide first whether the State had met&para;<br>its burden with respect to the death sentence, and to reach&para;<br>that decision unanimously, the instructions deprived the&para;<br>jury of a meaningful opportunity to consider the third&para;<br>option that was before it, namely, a life sentence. Indeed,&para;<br>these instructions are every bit as pernicious as those at&para;<br>issue in Beck because they would have led individual&para;<br>jurors (falsely) to believe that their failure to agree might&para;<br>have resulted in a new trial and that, in any event, they&para;<br>could not give effect to their determination that a life&para;<br>sentence was appropriate unless and until they had first&para;<br>convinced each of their peers on the jury to reject the&para;<br>death sentence.&para;<br>Admittedly, Spisak has never identified Beck as the&para;<br>source of the constitutional infirmity at issue in this case,&para;<br>nor did the courts below cite or rely upon it. But Spisak&para;<br>has consistently pressed his argument in terms that are&para;<br>wholly consistent with Beck. On direct appeal he con&para;<br>tended, for example, that he:&para;<br>“was severely prejudiced by the erroneous jury forms&para;<br>because the jurors were never informed of what would&para;<br>happen if they were unable to reach a unanimous de&para;<br>cision. That may have led to irreparable speculation&para;<br>that if they failed to agree, Frank Spisak would be&para;<br>freed or have a new trial or sentencing hearing. Such&para;<br>improper speculation may have led those not in&para;<br>agreement with death to go along with a majority.&para;<br>The jury should have been instructed that if they were&para;<br>unable to unanimously agree to death they must re&para;<br>turn a verdict of one of the life sentences or in the al&para;<br>ternative, the court would impose a life sentence.”&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SMITH v. SPISAK&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Exh. 28D, 16 Record 391 (Brief for Supreme Court of&para;<br>Ohio).&para;<br>The untenable choice Spisak describes is perfectly analo&para;<br>gous to the quandary, discussed above, that we described&para;<br>in Beck. See also 447 U. S., at 644 (“It is extremely doubt&para;<br>ful that juries will understand the full implications of a&para;<br>mistrial or will have any confidence that their choice of the&para;<br>mistrial option will ultimately lead to the right result.&para;<br>Thus, they could have no assurance that a second trial&para;<br>would end in the conviction of the defendant on a lesser&para;<br>included offense” (footnote omitted)). Spisak and the&para;<br>Court of Appeals both correctly assailed the jury instruc&para;<br>tions at issue in this case, but in my view Beck provides&para;<br>the proper basis in clearly established federal law to con&para;<br>clude the instructions were unconstitutional.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Petitioner defends Spisak’s counsel’s closing argument&para;<br>as a reasonable strategic decision “to draw the sting out of&para;<br>the prosecution’s argument and gain credibility with the&para;<br>jury by conceding the weaknesses of his own case.” Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 37. I agree that such a strategy is generally&para;<br>a reasonable one and, indeed, was a reasonable strategy&para;<br>under the difficult circumstances of this case. Even&para;<br>Spisak concedes that his counsel “faced an admittedly&para;<br>difficult case in closing argument in the penalty phase.”&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 43. But, surely, a strategy can be&para;<br>executed so poorly as to render even the most reasonable&para;<br>of trial tactics constitutionally deficient under Strickland&para;<br>v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). And this is such a&para;<br>case.&para;<br>It is difficult to convey how thoroughly egregious coun&para;<br>sel’s closing argument was without reproducing it in its&para;<br>entirety.&para;<br>The Court’s assessment of the closing as&para;<br>“lengthy and rambling” and its brief description of its&para;<br>content, see ante, at 10, does not accurately capture the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>catastrophe of counsel’s failed strategy. Suffice it to say&para;<br>that the argument shares far more in common with a&para;<br>prosecutor’s closing than with a criminal defense attor&para;<br>ney’s. Indeed, the argument was so outrageous that it&para;<br>would have rightly subjected a prosecutor to charges of&para;<br>misconduct. See Brief for Steven Lubet et al. as Amici&para;<br>Curiae 15–16 (observing that counsel’s closing argument&para;<br>“would have been improper even coming from the prosecu&para;<br>tor”). A few examples are in order.&para;<br>Presumably to take the “sting” out of the prosecution’s&para;<br>case, Brief for Petitioner 37, counsel described his client’s&para;<br>acts in vivid detail to the jury:&para;<br>“[Y]ou can smell almost the blood. You can smell, if&para;<br>you will, the urine. You are in a bathroom, and it is&para;<br>death, and you can smell the death . . . and you can&para;<br>feel, the loneliness of that railroad platform . . . and&para;<br>we can all know the terror that [the victim] felt when&para;<br>he turned and looked into those thick glasses and&para;<br>looked into the muzzle of a gun that kept spitting out&para;<br>bullets . . . And we can see a relatively young man cut&para;<br>down with so many years to live, and we could re&para;<br>member his widow, and we certainly can remember&para;<br>looking at his children . . . There are too many family&para;<br>albums. There are too many family portraits dated&para;<br>1982 that have too many empty spaces.

SPISAK&para;<br>Opinion of STEVENS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>marks omitted).&para;<br>Presumably to “gain credibility” with the jury, Brief of&para;<br>Petitioner 37, counsel argued that his client deserved no&para;<br>sympathy for his actions:&para;<br>“Sympathy, of course, is not part of your considera&para;<br>tion. And even if it was, certainly, don’t look to him&para;<br>for sympathy, because he demands none. And, ladies&para;<br>and gentlemen, when you turn and look at Frank&para;<br>Spisak, don’t look for good deeds, because he has done&para;<br>none. Don’t look for good thoughts, because he has&para;<br>none. He is sick, he is twisted. He is demented, and&para;<br>he is never going to be any different.” 465 F. 3d, at&para;<br>705 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>And then the strategy really broke down: At no point&para;<br>did counsel endeavor to direct his negative statements&para;<br>about his client toward an express appeal for leniency.5&para;<br>On the contrary, counsel concluded by telling the jury that&para;<br>“whatever you do, we are going to be proud of you,” ibid.&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted), which I take to mean&para;<br>that, in counsel’s view, “either outcome, death or life,&para;<br>would be a valid conclusion,” ibid.&para;<br>Spisak’s crimes, and the seemingly unmitigated hatred&para;<br>motivating their commission, were truly awful. But that&para;<br>does not excuse a lawyer’s duty to represent his client&para;<br>within the bounds of prevailing professional norms. The&para;<br>mere fact that counsel, laudably, may have had a “strat&para;<br>egy” to build rapport with the jury and lessen the impact&para;<br>of the prosecution’s case, does not excuse counsel’s utter&para;<br>——————&para;<br>aggravating circumstances but not including heinous circumstances of&para;<br>offense).&para;<br>5 Counsel did attempt to appeal to the jury’s sense of humanity, per&para;<br>haps implicitly suggesting that humane people do not condemn others,&para;<br>especially those with mental illness, to death. App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>339a–341a. But counsel never requested a life sentence on behalf of his&para;<br>client.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

In short, counsel’s argument grossly&para;<br>transgressed the bounds of what constitutionally compe&para;<br>tent counsel would have done in a similar situation.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Notwithstanding these two serious constitutional errors,&para;<br>I agree with the Court that these errors do not entitle&para;<br>Spisak to relief. As JUSTICE BREYER’s discussion in Part&para;<br>III makes vividly clear, see ante, at 11–14, Spisak’s own&para;<br>conduct alienated and ostracized the jury, and his crimes&para;<br>were monstrous. In my judgment even the most skillful of&para;<br>closing arguments—even one befitting Clarence Darrow—&para;<br>would not have created a reasonable probability of a dif&para;<br>ferent outcome in this case. Similarly, in light of Spisak’s&para;<br>conduct before the jury and the gravity of the aggravating&para;<br>circumstances of the offense, the instructional error was&para;<br>also harmless because it did not have a substantial and&para;<br>injurious effect on this record, Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507&para;<br>U.
