UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FOURTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–1493. Argued January 22, 2014—Decided June 16, 2014&para;<br>Petitioner Bruce Abramski offered to purchase a handgun for his uncle.&para;<br>The form that federal regulations required Abramski to fill out (Form&para;<br>4473) asked whether he was the “actual transferee/buyer” of the gun,&para;<br>and clearly warned that a straw purchaser (namely, someone buying&para;<br>a gun on behalf of another) was not the actual buyer. Abramski&para;<br>falsely answered that he was the actual buyer. Abramski was convicted for knowingly making false statements “with respect to any&para;<br>fact material to the lawfulness of the sale” of a gun, 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§922(a)(6), and for making a false statement “with respect to the information required . . . to be kept” in the gun dealer’s records,&para;<br>§924(a)(1)(A). The Fourth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Abramski’s misrepresentation is material under §922(a)(6).&para;<br>Pp. 7–22.&para;<br>(a) Abramski contends that federal gun laws are entirely unconcerned with straw arrangements: So long as the person at the counter&para;<br>is eligible to own a gun, the sale to him is legal under the statute. To&para;<br>be sure, federal law regulates licensed dealer’s transactions with&para;<br>“persons” or “transferees” without specifying whether that language&para;<br>refers to the straw buyer or the actual purchaser. But when read in&para;<br>light of the statute’s context, structure, and purpose, it is clear this&para;<br>language refers to the true buyer rather than the straw. Federal gun&para;<br>law establishes an elaborate system of in-person identification and&para;<br>background checks to ensure that guns are kept out of the hands of&para;<br>felons and other prohibited purchasers. §§922(c), 922(t). It also imposes record-keeping requirements to assist law enforcement authorities in investigating serious crimes through the tracing of guns to&para;<br>their buyers. §922(b)(5), 923(g). These provisions would mean little&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>if a would-be gun buyer could evade them all simply by enlisting the&para;<br>aid of an intermediary to execute the paperwork on his behalf. The&para;<br>statute’s language is thus best read in context to refer to the actual&para;<br>rather than nominal buyer. This conclusion is reinforced by this&para;<br>Court’s standard practice of focusing on practical realities rather&para;<br>than legal formalities when identifying the parties to a transaction.&para;<br>Pp. 7–19.&para;<br>(b) Abramski argues more narrowly that his false response was&para;<br>not material because his uncle could have legally bought a gun for&para;<br>himself. But Abramski’s false statement prevented the dealer from&para;<br>insisting that the true buyer (Alvarez) appear in person, provide&para;<br>identifying information, show a photo ID, and submit to a background check. §§922(b), (c), (t). Nothing in the statute suggests that&para;<br>these legal duties may be wiped away merely because the actual buyer turns out to be legally eligible to own a gun. Because the dealer&para;<br>could not have lawfully sold the gun had it known that Abramski was&para;<br>not the true buyer, the misstatement was material to the lawfulness&para;<br>of the sale. Pp. 19–22.&para;<br>2. Abramski’s misrepresentation about the identity of the actual&para;<br>buyer concerned “information required by [Chapter 44 of Title 18 of&para;<br>the United States Code] to be kept” in the dealer’s records.&para;<br>§924(a)(1)(A). Chapter 44 contains a provision requiring a dealer to&para;<br>“maintain such records . . . as the Attorney General may . . . prescribe.” §923(g)(1)(A). The Attorney General requires every licensed&para;<br>dealer to retain in its records a completed copy of Form 4473, see 27&para;<br>CFR §478.124(b), and that form in turn includes the “actual buyer”&para;<br>question that Abramski answered falsely. Therefore, falsely answering a question on Form 4473 violates §924(a)(1)(A).

To ensure the accuracy of those submissions, a federal statute imposes criminal penalties on&para;<br>any person who, in connection with a firearm’s acquisition,&para;<br>makes false statements about “any fact material to the&para;<br>lawfulness of the sale.” 18 U. S. C. §922(a)(6). In this&para;<br>case, we consider how that law applies to a so-called straw&para;<br>purchaser—namely, a person who buys a gun on someone&para;<br>else’s behalf while falsely claiming that it is for himself.&para;<br>We hold that such a misrepresentation is punishable&para;<br>under the statute, whether or not the true buyer could&para;<br>have purchased the gun without the straw.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Federal law has for over 40 years regulated sales by&para;<br>licensed firearms dealers, principally to prevent guns from&para;<br>falling into the wrong hands. See Gun Control Act of&para;<br>1968, 18 U. S. C. §921 et seq. Under §922(g), certain classes&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of people—felons, drug addicts, and the mentally ill, to&para;<br>list a few—may not purchase or possess any firearm. And&para;<br>to ensure they do not, §922(d) forbids a licensed dealer&para;<br>from selling a gun to anyone it knows, or has reasonable&para;<br>cause to believe, is such a prohibited buyer. See Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S. 814, 825 (1974) (“[T]he&para;<br>focus of the federal scheme,” in controlling access to weapons, “is the federally licensed firearms dealer”).&para;<br>The statute establishes a detailed scheme to enable the&para;<br>dealer to verify, at the point of sale, whether a potential&para;<br>buyer may lawfully own a gun. Section 922(c) brings the&para;<br>would-be purchaser onto the dealer’s “business premises”&para;<br>by prohibiting, except in limited circumstances, the sale of&para;<br>a firearm “to a person who does not appear in person” at&para;<br>that location. Other provisions then require the dealer to&para;<br>check and make use of certain identifying information&para;<br>received from the buyer. Before completing any sale, the&para;<br>dealer must “verif[y] the identity of the transferee by&para;<br>examining a valid identification document” bearing a&para;<br>photograph. §922(t)(1)(C). In addition, the dealer must&para;<br>procure the buyer’s “name, age, and place of residence.”&para;<br>§922(b)(5). And finally, the dealer must (with limited&para;<br>exceptions not at issue here1) submit that information&para;<br>to the National Instant Background Check System (NICS)&para;<br>to determine whether the potential purchaser is for&para;<br>any reason disqualified from owning a firearm. See&para;<br>§§922(t)(1)(A)–(B).&para;<br>The statute further insists that the dealer keep certain&para;<br>records, to enable federal authorities both to enforce the&para;<br>law’s verification measures and to trace firearms used in&para;<br>crimes. See H. R. Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 14&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>principal exception is for any buyer who has a state permit that&para;<br>has been “issued only after an authorized government official has&para;<br>verified” the buyer’s eligibility to own a gun under both federal and&para;<br>state law. §922(t)(3).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(1968). A dealer must maintain the identifying information mentioned above (i.e., name, age, and residence) in&para;<br>its permanent files. See §922(b)(5). In addition, the dealer&para;<br>must keep “such records of . . . sale[ ] or other disposition of firearms . . . as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe.” §923(g)(1)(A). And the Attorney General (or his designee) may obtain and inspect any of those&para;<br>records, “in the course of a bona fide criminal investigation,” to “determin[e] the disposition of 1 or more firearms.” §923(g)(7).&para;<br>To implement all those statutory requirements, the&para;<br>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives&para;<br>(ATF) developed Form 4473 for gun sales. See Supp. App.&para;<br>1–6. The part of that form to be completed by the buyer&para;<br>requests his name, birth date, and address, as well as&para;<br>certain other identifying information (for example, his&para;<br>height, weight, and race). The form further lists all the&para;<br>factors disqualifying a person from gun ownership, and&para;<br>asks the would-be buyer whether any of them apply (e.g.,&para;<br>“[h]ave you ever been convicted . . . of a felony?”). Id., at 1.&para;<br>Most important here, Question 11.a. asks (with bolded&para;<br>emphasis appearing on the form itself):&para;<br>“Are you the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm(s)&para;<br>listed on this form? Warning: You are not the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm(s) on&para;<br>behalf of another person. If you are not the actual buyer, the dealer cannot transfer the firearm(s) to you.” Ibid.&para;<br>The accompanying instructions for that question provide:&para;<br>“Question 11.a. Actual Transferee/Buyer: For&para;<br>purposes of this form, you are the actual transferee/&para;<br>buyer if you are purchasing the firearm for yourself&para;<br>or otherwise acquiring the firearm for yourself . . . .&para;<br>You are also the actual transferee/buyer if you are legitimately purchasing the firearm as a gift for a third&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>party. ACTUAL TRANSFEREE/BUYER EXAMPLES: Mr. Smith asks Mr. Jones to purchase a firearm for Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith gives Mr. Jones the&para;<br>money for the firearm. Mr. Jones is NOT THE&para;<br>ACTUAL TRANSFEREE/BUYER of the firearm&para;<br>and must answer “NO” to question 11.a.” Id., at 4.&para;<br>After responding to this and other questions, the customer&para;<br>must sign a certification declaring his answers “true,&para;<br>correct and complete.” Id., at 2. That certification provides that the signator “understand[s] that making any&para;<br>false . . . statement” respecting the transaction—and,&para;<br>particularly, “answering ‘yes’ to question 11.a. if [he is] not&para;<br>the actual buyer”—is a crime “punishable as a felony&para;<br>under Federal law.” Ibid. (bold typeface deleted).&para;<br>Two statutory provisions, each designed to ensure that&para;<br>the dealer can rely on the truthfulness of the buyer’s disclosures in carrying out its obligations, criminalize certain&para;<br>false statements about firearms transactions. First and&para;<br>foremost, §922(a)(6), provides as follows:&para;<br>“It shall be unlawful . . . for any person in connection&para;<br>with the acquisition or attempted acquisition of any&para;<br>firearm or ammunition from [a licensed dealer] knowingly to make any false or fictitious oral or written&para;<br>statement . . . , intended or likely to deceive such&para;<br>[dealer] with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or other disposition of such firearm&para;<br>or ammunition under the provisions of this chapter.”&para;<br>That provision helps make certain that a dealer will receive truthful information as to any matter relevant to a&para;<br>gun sale’s legality. In addition, §924(a)(1)(A) prohibits&para;<br>“knowingly mak[ing] any false statement or representation with respect to the information required by this chapter to be kept in the records” of a federally licensed gun&para;<br>dealer. The question in this case is whether, as the ATF&para;<br>declares in Form 4473’s certification, those statutory&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>provisions criminalize a false answer to Question 11.a.—&para;<br>that is, a customer’s statement that he is the “actual&para;<br>transferee/buyer,” purchasing a firearm for himself, when&para;<br>in fact he is a straw purchaser, buying the gun on someone&para;<br>else’s behalf.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The petitioner here is Bruce Abramski, a former police&para;<br>officer who offered to buy a Glock 19 handgun for his&para;<br>uncle, Angel Alvarez. (Abramski thought he could get the&para;<br>gun for a discount by showing his old police identification,&para;<br>though the Government contends that because he had&para;<br>been fired from his job two years earlier, he was no longer&para;<br>authorized to use that card.) Accepting his nephew’s offer,&para;<br>Alvarez sent Abramski a check for $400 with “Glock 19&para;<br>handgun” written on the memo line. Two days later,&para;<br>Abramski went to Town Police Supply, a federally licensed&para;<br>firearms dealer, to make the purchase. There, he filled&para;<br>out Form 4473, falsely checking “Yes” in reply to Question&para;<br>11.a.—that is, asserting he was the “actual transferee/&para;<br>buyer” when, according to the form’s clear definition, he&para;<br>was not. He also signed the requisite certification, acknowledging his understanding that a false answer to&para;<br>Question 11.a. is a federal crime. After Abramski’s name&para;<br>cleared the NICS background check, the dealer sold him&para;<br>the Glock. Abramski then deposited the $400 check in his&para;<br>bank account, transferred the gun to Alvarez, and got back&para;<br>a receipt. Federal agents found that receipt while executing a search warrant at Abramski’s home after he became&para;<br>a suspect in a different crime.&para;<br>A grand jury indicted Abramski for violating §§922(a)(6)&para;<br>and 924(a)(1)(A) by falsely affirming in his response to&para;<br>Question 11.a. that he was the Glock’s actual buyer.&para;<br>Abramski moved to dismiss both charges. He argued that&para;<br>his misrepresentation on Question 11.a. was not “material&para;<br>to the lawfulness of the sale” under §922(a)(6) because&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Alvarez was legally eligible to own a gun. And he claimed&para;<br>that the false statement did not violate §924(a)(1)(A)&para;<br>because a buyer’s response to Question 11.a. is not “required . . . to be kept in the records” of a gun dealer. After&para;<br>the District Court denied those motions, see 778 F. Supp.&para;<br>2d 678 (WD Va. 2011), Abramski entered a conditional&para;<br>guilty plea, reserving his right to challenge the rulings.&para;<br>The District Court then sentenced him to five years of&para;<br>probation on each count, running concurrently.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the&para;<br>convictions. 706 F. 3d 307 (2013). It noted a division&para;<br>among appellate courts on the question Abramski raised&para;<br>about §922(a)(6)’s materiality requirement: Of three courts&para;<br>to have addressed the issue, one agreed with Abramski&para;<br>that a misrepresentation on Question 11.a. is immaterial&para;<br>if “the true purchaser [here, Alvarez] can lawfully purchase a firearm directly.” Id., at 315 (quoting United&para;<br>States v. Polk, 118 F. 3d 286, 295 (CA5 1997)).2 The&para;<br>Fourth Circuit, however, thought the majority position&para;<br>correct: “[T]he identity of the actual purchaser of a firearm&para;<br>is a constant that is always material to the lawfulness of a&para;<br>firearm acquisition under §922(a)(6).” 706 F. 3d, at 316.&para;<br>The court also held that Abramski’s conviction under&para;<br>§924(a)(1)(A) was valid, finding that the statute required a&para;<br>dealer to maintain the information at issue in its records.&para;<br>Id., at 317.&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2013), principally&para;<br>to resolve the Circuit split about §922(a)(6). In this Court,&para;<br>Abramski renews his claim that a false answer to Question 11.a. is immaterial if the true buyer is legally eligible&para;<br>to purchase a firearm. But Abramski now focuses on a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Compare Polk, 118 F. 3d, at 294–295, with United States v. Morales,&para;<br>687 F. 3d 697, 700–701 (CA6 2012) (a misrepresentation about the true&para;<br>purchaser’s identity is material even when he can legally own a gun);&para;<br>United States v. Frazier, 605 F. 3d 1271, 1279–1280 (CA11 2010)&para;<br>(same).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>new and more ambitious argument, which he concedes no&para;<br>court has previously accepted. See Brief for Petitioner i.3&para;<br>In brief, he alleges that a false response to Question 11.a.&para;<br>is never material to a gun sale’s legality, whether or not&para;<br>the actual buyer is eligible to own a gun. We begin with&para;<br>that fundamental question, next turn to what has become&para;<br>Abramski’s back-up argument under §922(a)(6), and finally consider the relatively easy question pertaining to&para;<br>§924(A)(1)(a)’s separate false-statement prohibition. On&para;<br>each score, we affirm Abramski’s conviction.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Abramski’s broad theory (mostly echoed by the dissent)&para;<br>is that federal gun law simply does not care about arrangements involving straw purchasers: So long as the&para;<br>person at the counter is eligible to own a gun, the sale to&para;<br>him is legal under the statute. That is true, Abramski&para;<br>contends, irrespective of any agreement that person has&para;<br>made to purchase the firearm on behalf of someone else—&para;<br>including someone who cannot lawfully buy or own a gun&para;<br>himself.&para;<br>Accordingly, Abramski concludes, his “false&para;<br>statement that he was the [Glock 19’s] ‘actual buyer,’ ” as&para;<br>that term was “defined in Question 11.a., was not material”&para;<br>—indeed, was utterly irrelevant—“to the lawfulness of&para;<br>the sale.” Id., at 31 (emphasis deleted); see also post, at 4&para;<br>(opinion of SCALIA, J.). In essence, he claims, Town Police&para;<br>Supply could legally have sold the gun to him even if he had&para;<br>truthfully answered Question 11.a. by disclosing that he&para;<br>was a straw—because, again, all the federal firearms law&para;<br>cares about is whether the individual standing at the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Reflecting that prior consensus, neither of Abramski’s principal&para;<br>amici—the National Rifle Association and a group of 26 States—joins&para;<br>Abramski in making this broader argument. They confine themselves&para;<br>to supporting the more limited claim about straw purchases made on&para;<br>behalf of eligible gun owners, addressed infra, at 19–22.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>dealer’s counter meets the requirements to buy a gun.4&para;<br>At its core, that argument relies on one true fact: Federal gun law regulates licensed dealers’ transactions with&para;<br>“persons” or “transferees,” without specifically referencing&para;<br>straw purchasers. Section 922(d), for example, bars a&para;<br>dealer from “sell[ing] or otherwise dispos[ing] of ” a firearm to any “person” who falls within a prohibited category—&para;<br>felons, drug addicts, the mentally ill, and so forth. See&para;<br>supra, at 1–2; see also §922(b)(5) (before selling a gun to a&para;<br>“person,” the dealer must take down his name, age, and&para;<br>residence); §922(t)(1) (before selling a gun to a “person,”&para;<br>the dealer must run a background check). Similarly,&para;<br>§922(t)(1)(C) requires the dealer to verify the identity of&para;<br>the “transferee” by checking a valid photo ID. See supra,&para;<br>at 2; see also §922(c) (spelling out circumstances in which&para;<br>a “transferee” may buy a gun without appearing at the&para;<br>dealer’s premises). Abramski contends that Congress’s&para;<br>use of such language alone, sans any mention of “straw&para;<br>purchasers” or “actual buyers,” shows that “[i]t is not&para;<br>illegal to buy a gun for someone else.” Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>15–16; Reply Brief 1; see also post, at 2–6.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The dissent reserves the question whether the false statement&para;<br>would be material if the straw purchaser knew that the true buyer was&para;<br>not eligible to own a firearm. Post, at 6, n. 2. But first, that reservation is of quite limited scope: Unlike Abramski’s back-up argument,&para;<br>which imposes liability whenever the true purchaser cannot legally buy&para;<br>a gun, the dissent’s reservation applies only when the straw has&para;<br>knowledge of (or at least reasonable cause to believe) that fact. And as&para;<br>we will later note, straws often do not have such knowledge. See infra,&para;<br>at 12–13. Second, the reservation (fairly enough for a reservation) rests&para;<br>on an uncertain legal theory. According to the dissent, a straw buyer&para;<br>might violate §922(a)(6) if a dealer’s sale to him aids and abets his&para;<br>violation of §922(d)—a provision barring knowingly transferring a gun&para;<br>to an ineligible person, see infra, at 8, 17–18. But that reasoning&para;<br>presupposes that a firearms dealer acting in the ordinary course of&para;<br>business can ever have the intent needed to aid and abet a crime—a&para;<br>question this Court reserved not six months ago. See Rosemond v.&para;<br>United States, 572 U. S. ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12, n. 8).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>But that language merely raises, rather than answers,&para;<br>the critical question: In a straw purchase, who is the&para;<br>“person” or “transferee” whom federal gun law addresses?&para;<br>Is that “person” the middleman buying a firearm on someone else’s behalf (often because the ultimate recipient&para;<br>could not buy it himself, or wants to camouflage the transaction)? Or is that “person” instead the individual really&para;<br>paying for the gun and meant to take possession of it upon&para;<br>completion of the purchase? Is it the conduit at the counter, or the gun’s intended owner?5 In answering that inquiry, we must (as usual) interpret the relevant words not&para;<br>in a vacuum, but with reference to the statutory context,&para;<br>“structure, history, and purpose.” Maracich v. Spears, 570&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 26). All those tools of&para;<br>divining meaning—not to mention common sense, which is&para;<br>a fortunate (though not inevitable) side-benefit of construing statutory terms fairly—demonstrate that §922, in&para;<br>regulating licensed dealers’ gun sales, looks through the&para;<br>straw to the actual buyer.6&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The dissent claims the answer is easy because “if I give my son $10&para;<br>and tell him to pick up milk and eggs at the store, no English speaker&para;<br>would say that the store ‘sells’ the milk and eggs to me.” Post, at 4.&para;<br>But try a question more similar to the one the gun law’s text raises: If I&para;<br>send my brother to the Apple Store with money and instructions to&para;<br>purchase an iPhone, and then take immediate and sole possession of&para;<br>that device, am I the “person” (or “transferee”) who has bought the&para;<br>phone or is he? Nothing in ordinary English usage compels an answer&para;<br>either way.&para;<br>6 Contrary to the dissent’s view, our analysis does not rest on mere&para;<br>“purpose-based arguments.” Post. at 7. We simply recognize that a&para;<br>court should not interpret each word in a statute with blinders on,&para;<br>refusing to look at the word’s function within the broader statutory&para;<br>context. As we have previously put the point, a “provision that may&para;<br>seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the&para;<br>statutory scheme . . . because only one of the permissible meanings&para;<br>produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the&para;<br>law.” United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates,&para;<br>Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The overarching reason is that Abramski’s reading&para;<br>would undermine—indeed, for all important purposes,&para;<br>would virtually repeal—the gun law’s core provisions.7 As&para;<br>noted earlier, the statute establishes an elaborate system&para;<br>to verify a would-be gun purchaser’s identity and check on&para;<br>his background. See supra, at 2. It also requires that the&para;<br>information so gathered go into a dealer’s permanent&para;<br>records. See supra, at 2–3. The twin goals of this comprehensive scheme are to keep guns out of the hands of&para;<br>criminals and others who should not have them, and to&para;<br>assist law enforcement authorities in investigating serious&para;<br>crimes. See Huddleston, 415 U. S., at 824; supra, at 2–3.&para;<br>And no part of that scheme would work if the statute&para;<br>turned a blind eye to straw purchases—if, in other words,&para;<br>the law addressed not the substance of a transaction, but&para;<br>only empty formalities.&para;<br>To see why, consider what happens in a typical straw&para;<br>purchase. A felon or other person who cannot buy or own&para;<br>a gun still wants to obtain one. (Or, alternatively, a person who could legally buy a firearm wants to conceal his&para;<br>purchase, maybe so he can use the gun for criminal purposes without fear that police officers will later trace it to&para;<br>him.) Accordingly, the prospective buyer enlists an intermediary to help him accomplish his illegal aim. Perhaps&para;<br>he conscripts a loyal friend or family member; perhaps&para;<br>more often, he hires a stranger to purchase the gun for a&para;<br>price. The actual purchaser might even accompany the&para;<br>straw to the gun shop, instruct him which firearm to buy,&para;<br>give him the money to pay at the counter, and take possession as they walk out the door.

See §§922(b)(5),&para;<br>(t)(1)(C); supra, at 2. And that identification in turn permits a background check: The dealer runs the purchaser’s&para;<br>name through the NICS database to discover whether he&para;<br>is, for example, a felon, drug addict, or mentally ill person.&para;<br>See §§922(d), (t)(1); supra, at 2. All those provisions are&para;<br>designed to accomplish what this Court has previously&para;<br>termed Congress’s “principal purpose” in enacting the&para;<br>statute—“to curb crime by keeping ‘firearms out of the&para;<br>hands of those not legally entitled to possess them.’ ”&para;<br>Huddleston, 415 U. S., at 824 (quoting S. Rep. No. 1501,&para;<br>90th Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1968)). But under Abramski’s&para;<br>reading, the statutory terms would be utterly ineffectual,&para;<br>because the identification and background check would be&para;<br>of the wrong person. The provisions would evaluate the&para;<br>eligibility of mere conduits, while allowing every criminal&para;<br>(and drug addict and so forth) to escape that assessment&para;<br>and walk away with a weapon.&para;<br>Similarly, Abramski’s view would defeat the point of&para;<br>§922(c), which tightly restricts the sale of guns “to a person who does not appear in person at the licensee’s business premises.” See supra, at 2.

See 27 CFR&para;<br>§478.96(b) (2014), 18 U. S. C. §922(t)(3); n. 1, supra. And&para;<br>even when an individual fits within that category, he still&para;<br>must submit to the dealer a sworn statement that he can&para;<br>lawfully own a gun, as well as provide the name and address of the principal law enforcement officer in his community. See §922(c)(1). The dealer then has to forward&para;<br>notice of the sale to that officer, in order to allow law&para;<br>enforcement authorities to investigate the legality of the&para;<br>sale and, if necessary, call a stop to it. See §§922(c)(2)–(3).&para;<br>The provision thus prevents remote sales except to a small&para;<br>class of buyers subject to extraordinary procedures—&para;<br>again, to ensure effective verification of a potential purchaser’s eligibility. Yet on Abramski’s view, a person&para;<br>could easily bypass the scheme, purchasing a gun without&para;<br>ever leaving his home by dispatching to a gun store a&para;<br>hired deliveryman. Indeed, if Abramski were right, we see&para;<br>no reason why anyone (and certainly anyone with lessthan-pure motives) would put himself through the procedures laid out in §922(c): Deliverymen, after all, are not so&para;<br>hard to come by.&para;<br>And likewise, the statute’s record-keeping provisions&para;<br>would serve little purpose if the records kept were of&para;<br>nominal rather than real buyers. As noted earlier, dealers&para;<br>must store, and law enforcement officers may obtain,&para;<br>information about a gun buyer’s identity. See §§922(b)(5),&para;<br>923(g); supra, at 3. That information helps to fight serious&para;<br>crime. When police officers retrieve a gun at a crime&para;<br>scene, they can trace it to the buyer and consider him as a&para;<br>suspect. See National Shooting Sports Foundation, Inc. v.&para;<br>Jones, 716 F. 3d 200, 204 (CADC 2013) (describing law&para;<br>enforcement’s use of firearm tracing).

See §923(g)(3) (imposing a reporting obligation when a person buys multiple handguns within five&para;<br>days). But once again, those provisions can serve their&para;<br>objective only if the records point to the person who took&para;<br>actual control of the gun(s). Otherwise, the police will at&para;<br>most learn the identity of an intermediary, who could not&para;<br>have been responsible for the gun’s use and might know&para;<br>next to nothing about the actual buyer. See, e.g., United&para;<br>States v.

Abramski’s view would thus render the required records close to useless for aiding law enforcement:&para;<br>Putting true numbskulls to one side, anyone purchasing a&para;<br>gun for criminal purposes would avoid leaving a paper&para;<br>trail by the simple expedient of hiring a straw.&para;<br>To sum up so far: All the prerequisites for buying a gun&para;<br>described above refer to a “person” or “transferee.” Read&para;<br>Abramski’s way (“the man at the counter”), those terms&para;<br>deny effect to the regulatory scheme, as criminals could&para;<br>always use straw purchasers to evade the law.8 Read the&para;<br>other way (“the man getting, and always meant to get, the&para;<br>firearm”), those terms give effect to the statutory provi——————&para;<br>8 The dissent is mistaken when it says that the ATF’s own former&para;<br>view of the statute refutes this proposition. See post, at 11–12. As we&para;<br>will later discuss, see infra, at 21–22, the ATF for a time thought that&para;<br>§922(a)(6) did not cover cases in which the true purchaser could have&para;<br>legally purchased a gun himself. But Abramski’s principal argument&para;<br>extends much further, to cases in which straws buy weapons for criminals, drug addicts, and other prohibited purchasers. For the reasons&para;<br>just stated, that interpretation would render the statute all but useless.&para;<br>And although the dissent appeals to a snippet of congressional testimony to suggest that ATF once briefly held that extreme view of the&para;<br>statute, it agrees that by at least 1979 (well over three decades ago),&para;<br>ATF recognized the unlawfulness of straw purchases on behalf of&para;<br>prohibited persons.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>ABRAMSKI v.

That broader word, we have&para;<br>previously held, does not focus on “legal title”—let alone&para;<br>legal title for a few short moments, until another, always&para;<br>intended transfer occurs. Huddleston, 415 U. S., at 820.&para;<br>Instead, the term signifies “com[ing] into possession,&para;<br>control, or power of disposal,” as the actual buyer in a&para;<br>straw purchase does. Ibid. Similarly, we have reasoned&para;<br>that such a substance-over-form approach draws support&para;<br>from the statute’s repeated references to “the sale or other&para;<br>disposition” of a firearm. §922(a)(6); see §922(d) (making&para;<br>it unlawful to “sell or otherwise dispose of ” a gun to a&para;<br>prohibited person). That term, we have stated, “was&para;<br>aimed at providing maximum coverage.” Id., at 826–827.&para;<br>We think such expansive language inconsistent with&para;<br>Abramski’s view of the statute, which would stare myopically at the nominal buyer while remaining blind to the&para;<br>person exiting the transaction with control of the gun.&para;<br>Finally, our reading of §922 comports with courts’&para;<br>standard practice, evident in many legal spheres and&para;<br>presumably known to Congress, of ignoring artifice when&para;<br>identifying the parties to a transaction. In United States&para;<br>v. One 1936 Model Ford V-8 Deluxe Coach, Commercial&para;<br>Credit Co., 307 U. S. 219 (1939), for example, we considered the operation of a statute requiring forfeiture of any&para;<br>interest in property that was used to violate prohibition&para;<br>laws, except if acquired in good faith. There, a straw&para;<br>purchaser had bought a car in his name but with his&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

See&para;<br>id., at 222–223. The Court held the finance company’s lien&para;<br>on the car non-forfeitable because the company had no&para;<br>hint that the straw was a straw—that his brother would&para;<br>in fact be the owner. See id., at 224. But had the company known, the Court made clear, a different result would&para;<br>have obtained: The company could not have relied on the&para;<br>formalities of the sale to the “ ‘straw’ purchaser” when it&para;<br>knew that the “real owner and purchaser” of the car was&para;<br>someone different. Id., at 223–224. We have similarly&para;<br>emphasized the need in other contexts, involving both&para;<br>criminal and civil penalties, to look through a transaction’s nominal parties to its true participants. See, e.g.,&para;<br>American Needle, Inc. v. National Football League, 560&para;<br>U.

Helvering, 293 U. S. 465, 470 (1935) (disregarding an&para;<br>intermediary shell corporation created to avoid taxes&para;<br>because doing otherwise would “exalt artifice above reality”).&para;<br>We do no more than that here in holding, consistent&para;<br>with §922’s text, structure, and purpose, that using a&para;<br>straw does not enable evasion of the firearms law.&para;<br>Abramski, along with the dissent, objects that such&para;<br>action is no circumvention—that Congress made an intentional choice, born of “political compromise,” to limit the&para;<br>gun law’s compass to the person at the counter, even if&para;<br>merely acting on another’s behalf. Reply Brief 11; post, at&para;<br>10–11. As evidence, Abramski states that the statute does&para;<br>not regulate beyond the initial point of sale. Because the&para;<br>law mostly addresses sales made by licensed dealers, a&para;<br>purchaser can (within wide limits) subsequently decide to&para;<br>resell his gun to another private party. See Reply Brief&para;<br>11. And similarly, Abramski says, a purchaser can buy a&para;<br>gun for someone else as a gift. See Brief for Petitioner 26–&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>27, n. 3. Abramski lumps in the same category the transfer of a gun from a nominal to a real buyer—as something,&para;<br>like a later resale or gift, meant to fall outside the statute’s&para;<br>(purported)&para;<br>standing-in-front-of-the-gun-dealer&para;<br>scope. See Reply Brief 13; see also post, at 7–9.&para;<br>But Abramski and the dissent draw the wrong conclusion from their observations about resales and gifts. Yes,&para;<br>Congress decided to regulate dealers’ sales, while leaving&para;<br>the secondary market for guns largely untouched. As we&para;<br>noted in Huddleston, Congress chose to make the dealer&para;<br>the “principal agent of federal enforcement” in “restricting&para;<br>[criminals’] access to firearms.” 415 U. S., at 824. And&para;<br>yes, that choice (like pretty much everything Congress&para;<br>does) was surely a result of compromise. But no, straw&para;<br>arrangements are not a part of the secondary market,&para;<br>separate and apart from the dealer’s sale. In claiming as&para;<br>much, Abramski merely repeats his mistaken assumption&para;<br>that the “person” who acquires a gun from a dealer in a&para;<br>case like this one is the straw, rather than the individual&para;<br>who has made a prior arrangement to pay for, take possession of, own, and use that part of the dealer’s stock.&para;<br>For all the reasons we have already given, that is not a&para;<br>plausible construction of a statute mandating that the&para;<br>dealer identify and run a background check on the person&para;<br>to whom it is (really, not fictitiously) selling a gun. See&para;<br>supra, at 9–15. The individual who sends a straw to a gun&para;<br>store to buy a firearm is transacting with the dealer, in&para;<br>every way but the most formal; and that distinguishes&para;<br>such a person from one who buys a gun, or receives a gun&para;<br>as a gift, from a private party.9 The line Congress drew&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The dissent responds: “That certainly distinguishes” the individual&para;<br>transacting with a dealer through a straw from an individual receiving&para;<br>a gun from a private party; “so would the fact that [the former] has&para;<br>orange hair.” Post, at 9.

But whatever the reason,&para;<br>the scarcity of controls in the secondary market provides&para;<br>no reason to gut the robust measures Congress enacted at&para;<br>the point of sale.&para;<br>Abramski claims further support for his argument from&para;<br>Congress’s decision in 1986 to amend §922(d) to prohibit a&para;<br>private party (and not just, as originally enacted, a licensed dealer) from selling a gun to someone he knows or&para;<br>reasonably should know cannot legally possess one. See&para;<br>Firearm Owners’ Protection Act, §102(5)(A), 100 Stat.&para;<br>451–452. According to Abramski, the revised §922(d)&para;<br>should be understood as Congress’s exclusive response to&para;<br>the potential dangers arising from straw purchases. See&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 26–27. The amendment shows, he&para;<br>claims, that “Congress chose to address this perceived&para;<br>problem in a way other than” by imposing liability under&para;<br>§922(a)(6) on a straw who tells a licensed dealer that he is&para;<br>the firearm’s actual buyer. Reply Brief 14, n. 2.&para;<br>But Congress’s amendment of §922(d) says nothing&para;<br>about §922(a)(6)’s application to straw purchasers. In enacting that amendment, Congress left §922(a)(6) just as&para;<br>it was, undercutting any suggestion that Congress some——————&para;<br>transacted with a licensed dealer is integral to the statute—because, as&para;<br>previously noted, “the federal scheme . . . controls access to weapons”&para;<br>through the federally licensed firearms dealer, who is “the principal&para;<br>agent of federal enforcement.” Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S.&para;<br>814, 824, 825 (1974); see supra, at 16. In so designing the statute,&para;<br>Congress chose not to pursue the goal of “controll[ing] access” to guns to&para;<br>the nth degree; buyers can, as the dissent says, avoid the statute’s&para;<br>background check and record-keeping requirements by getting a gun&para;<br>second-hand. But that possibility provides no justification for limiting&para;<br>the statute’s considered regulation of dealer sales.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>how intended to contract that provision’s reach. The&para;<br>amendment instead performed a different function: Rather&para;<br>than ensuring that a licensed dealer receives truthful&para;<br>information, it extended a minimal form of regulation to&para;<br>the secondary market. The revised §922(d) prevents a&para;<br>private person from knowingly selling a gun to an ineligible owner no matter when or how he acquired the weapon:&para;<br>It thus applies not just to a straw purchaser, but to an&para;<br>individual who bought a gun for himself and later decided&para;<br>to resell it. At the same time, §922(d) has nothing to say&para;<br>about a raft of cases §922(a)(6) covers, including all the&para;<br>(many) straw purchases in which the frontman does not&para;<br>know that the actual buyer is ineligible. See supra, at 13.&para;<br>Thus, §922(d) could not serve as an effective substitute for&para;<br>§922(a)(6). And the mere potential for some transactions&para;<br>to run afoul of both prohibitions gives no cause to read&para;<br>§922(d) as limiting §922(a)(6) (or vice versa). See, e.g.,&para;<br>United States v. Batchelder, 442 U. S. 114, 118–126&para;<br>(1979).10&para;<br>Abramski’s principal attack on his §922(a)(6) conviction&para;<br>therefore fails.

See&para;<br>post, at 12–14. That rule, as we have repeatedly emphasized, applies&para;<br>only if, “after considering text, structure, history and purpose, there&para;<br>remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute such that&para;<br>the Court must simply guess as to what Congress intended.” Maracich&para;<br>v.

We are not in that position here:&para;<br>Although the text creates some ambiguity, the context, structure,&para;<br>history, and purpose resolve it. The dissent would apply the rule of&para;<br>lenity here because the statute’s text, taken alone, permits a narrower&para;<br>construction, but we have repeatedly emphasized that is not the appropriate test. See, e.g., Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 138&para;<br>(1998); Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 239 (1993).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

That is because,&para;<br>for all the reasons we have given, the firearms law contemplates that the dealer will check not the fictitious&para;<br>purchaser’s but instead the true purchaser’s identity and&para;<br>eligibility for gun ownership. By concealing that Alvarez&para;<br>was the actual buyer, Abramski prevented the dealer from&para;<br>transacting with Alvarez face-to-face, see §922(c), recording his name, age, and residence, see §922(b)(5), inspecting his photo ID, see §922(t)(1)(C), submitting his identifying information to the background check system, see&para;<br>§922(t)(1)(B), and determining whether he was prohibited&para;<br>from receiving a firearm, see §922(d). In sum, Abramski&para;<br>thwarted application of essentially all of the firearms law’s&para;<br>requirements. We can hardly think of a misrepresentation&para;<br>any more material to a sale’s legality.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Abramski also challenges his §922(a)(6) conviction on a&para;<br>narrower ground. For purposes of this argument, he&para;<br>assumes that the Government can make its case when a&para;<br>straw hides the name of an underlying purchaser who is&para;<br>legally ineligible to own a gun. But, Abramski reminds us,&para;<br>that is not true here, because Alvarez could have bought a&para;<br>gun for himself. In such circumstances, Abramski claims&para;<br>that a false response to Question 11.a. is not material. See&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 28–30. Essentially, Abramski contends, when the hidden purchaser is eligible anyway to&para;<br>own a gun, all’s well that ends well, and all should be&para;<br>forgiven.&para;<br>But we think what we have already said shows the&para;<br>fallacy of that claim: Abramski’s false statement was&para;<br>material because had he revealed that he was purchasing&para;<br>the gun on Alvarez’s behalf, the sale could not have proceeded under the law—even though Alvarez turned out to&para;<br>be an eligible gun owner. The sale, as an initial matter,&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>would not have complied with §922(c)’s restrictions on&para;<br>absentee purchases. See supra, at 11–12. If the dealer&para;<br>here, Town Police Supply, had realized it was in fact&para;<br>selling a gun to Alvarez, it would have had to stop the&para;<br>transaction for failure to comply with those conditions.&para;<br>Yet more, the sale could not have gone forward because&para;<br>the dealer would have lacked the information needed to&para;<br>verify and record Alvarez’s identity and check his background. See §§922(b)(5), (t)(1)(B)–(C); supra, at 10–12.&para;<br>Those requirements, as we have explained, pertain to the&para;<br>real buyer; and the after-the-fact discovery that Alvarez&para;<br>would have passed the background check cannot somehow&para;<br>wipe them away. Accordingly, had Town Police Supply&para;<br>known Abramski was a straw, it could not have certified,&para;<br>as Form 4473 demands, its belief that the transfer was&para;<br>“not unlawful.” Supp. App. 3.&para;<br>An analogy may help show the weakness of Abramski’s&para;<br>argument. Suppose a would-be purchaser, Smith, lawfully&para;<br>could own a gun. But further suppose that, for reasons of&para;<br>his own, Smith uses an alias (let’s say Jones) to make the&para;<br>purchase. Would anyone say “no harm, no foul,” just&para;<br>because Smith is not in fact a prohibited person under&para;<br>§922(d)? We think not. Smith would in any event have&para;<br>made a false statement about who will own the gun, impeding the dealer’s ability to carry out its legal responsibilities. So too here.&para;<br>Abramski objects that because Alvarez could own a gun,&para;<br>the statute’s core purpose—“keeping guns out of the&para;<br>hands” of criminals and other prohibited persons—“is not&para;<br>even implicated.” Brief for Petitioner 29. But that argument (which would apply no less to the alias scenario)&para;<br>misunderstands the way the statute works. As earlier&para;<br>noted, the federal gun law makes the dealer “[t]he principal agent of federal enforcement.” Huddleston, 415 U. S.,&para;<br>at 824, see supra, at 16. It is that highly regulated, legally&para;<br>knowledgeable entity, possessing access to the expansive&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>NICS database, which has the responsibility to “[e]nsure&para;<br>that, in the course of sales or other dispositions . . . ,&para;<br>weapons [are not] obtained by individuals whose possession of them would be contrary to the public interest.” 415&para;<br>U. S., at 825. Nothing could be less consonant with the&para;<br>statutory scheme than placing that inquiry in the hands of&para;<br>an unlicensed straw purchaser, who is unlikely to be&para;<br>familiar with federal firearms law and has no ability to&para;<br>use the database to check whether the true buyer may&para;<br>own a gun. And in any event, keeping firearms out of the&para;<br>hands of criminals is not §922’s only goal: The statute’s&para;<br>record-keeping provisions, as we have said, are also designed to aid law enforcement in the investigation of&para;<br>crime. See supra, at 2–3, 12–13. Abramski’s proposed&para;<br>limitation on §922(a)(6) would undercut that purpose&para;<br>because many would-be criminals remain legally eligible&para;<br>to buy firearms, and thus could use straws to purchase an&para;<br>endless stream of guns off-the-books. See, e.g., Polk, 118&para;<br>F. 3d, at 289 (eligible gun buyer used straw purchasers to&para;<br>secretly accumulate an “arsenal of weapons” for a “massive offensive” against the Federal Government).&para;<br>In addition, Abramski briefly notes that until 1995, the&para;<br>ATF took the view that a straw purchaser’s misrepresentation counted as material only if the true buyer could not&para;<br>legally possess a gun. See Brief for Petitioner 7–8; n. 8,&para;<br>supra. We may put aside that ATF has for almost two&para;<br>decades now taken the opposite position, after reflecting&para;<br>on both appellate case law and changes in the statute. See&para;<br>Tr. of Oral Arg. 41; Brady Handgun Violence Prevention&para;<br>Act of 1993, §103, 107 Stat. 1541 (codified at 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§922(t)). The critical point is that criminal laws are for&para;<br>courts, not for the Government, to construe. See, e.g.,&para;<br>United States v. Apel, 571 U. S. ___, (2014) (slip op., at 9)&para;<br>(“[W]e have never held that the Government’s reading of a&para;<br>criminal statute is entitled to any deference”).

UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>which is to say, not relevant at all. Whether the Government interprets a criminal statute too broadly (as it sometimes does) or too narrowly (as the ATF used to in construing §922(a)(6)), a court has an obligation to correct its&para;<br>error. Here, nothing suggests that Congress—the entity&para;<br>whose voice does matter—limited its prohibition of a&para;<br>straw purchaser’s misrepresentation in the way Abramski&para;<br>proposes.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Finally, Abramski challenges his conviction under&para;<br>§924(a)(1)(A), which prohibits “knowingly mak[ing] any&para;<br>false statement . . . with respect to the information required by this chapter to be kept in the records” of a federally licensed dealer. That provision is broader than&para;<br>§922(a)(6) in one respect: It does not require that the false&para;<br>statement at issue be “material” in any way. At the same&para;<br>time, §924(a)(1)(A) includes an element absent from&para;<br>§922(a)(6): The false statement must relate to “information required by this chapter to be kept in [a dealer’s]&para;<br>records.” Abramski notes that the indictment in this case&para;<br>charged him with only one misrepresentation: his statement in response to Question 11.a. that he was buying the&para;<br>Glock on his own behalf rather than on someone else’s.&para;<br>And, he argues, that information (unlike the transferee’s&para;<br>“name, age, and place of residence,” which he plausibly&para;<br>reads the indictment as not mentioning) was not required&para;<br>“by this chapter”—but only by Form 4473 itself—to be kept&para;<br>in the dealer’s permanent records. Brief for Petitioner 32.&para;<br>We disagree. Included in “this chapter”—Chapter 44 of&para;<br>Title 18—is a provision, noted earlier, requiring a dealer&para;<br>to “maintain such records of . . . sale, or other disposition&para;<br>of firearms at his place of business for such period, and in&para;<br>such form, as the Attorney General may by regulations&para;<br>prescribe.” §923(g)(1)(A); supra, at 3. Because of that&para;<br>statutory section, the information that the Attorney General’s regulations compel a dealer to keep is information&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“required by this chapter.” And those regulations (the&para;<br>validity of which Abramski does not here contest) demand&para;<br>that every licensed dealer “retain . . . as a part of [its]&para;<br>required records, each Form 4473 obtained in the course&para;<br>of ” selling or otherwise disposing of a firearm. 27 CFR&para;<br>§478.124(b). Accordingly, a false answer on that form,&para;<br>such as the one Abramski made, pertains to information a&para;<br>dealer is statutorily required to maintain.11&para;<br>V&para;<br>No piece of information is more important under federal&para;<br>firearms law than the identity of a gun’s purchaser—the&para;<br>person who acquires a gun as a result of a transaction&para;<br>with a licensed dealer. Had Abramski admitted that he&para;<br>was not that purchaser, but merely a straw—that he was&para;<br>asking the dealer to verify the identity of, and run a background check on, the wrong individual—the sale here&para;<br>could not have gone forward. That makes Abramski’s&para;<br>misrepresentation on Question 11.a. material under&para;<br>§922(a)(6). And because that statement pertained to&para;<br>information that a dealer must keep in its permanent&para;<br>records under the firearms law, Abramski’s answer to&para;<br>Question 11.a. also violated §924(a)(1)(A). Accordingly, we&para;<br>affirm the judgment of the Fourth Circuit.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 The dissent argues that our view would impose criminal liability for&para;<br>a false answer even to an “ultra vires question,” such as “the buyer’s&para;<br>favorite color.” Post, at 15. We need not, and do not, opine on that&para;<br>hypothetical, because it is miles away from this case. As we have&para;<br>explained, see supra at 9–19, Question 11.a. is not ultra vires, but&para;<br>instead fundamental to the lawfulness of a gun sale. It is, indeed, part&para;<br>and parcel of the dealer’s determination of the (true) buyer’s “name,&para;<br>age, and place of residence,” which §922(b)(5) requires the dealer to&para;<br>keep. That section alone would justify Abramski’s conviction under&para;<br>§924(a)(1)(A) if the indictment here had clearly alleged that, in addition&para;<br>to answering Question 11.a. falsely, he lied about that buyer’s “name,&para;<br>age, and place of residence.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Abramski made a&para;<br>false statement when he claimed to be the gun’s “actual&para;<br>transferee/buyer” as Form 4473 defined that term. But&para;<br>that false statement was not “material to the lawfulness of&para;<br>the sale” since the truth—that Abramski was buying the&para;<br>gun for his uncle with his uncle’s money—would not have&para;<br>made the sale unlawful. See Kungys v. United States, 485&para;<br>U. S. 759, 775 (1988) (plurality opinion) (materiality is&para;<br>determined by asking “what would have ensued from&para;<br>official knowledge of the misrepresented fact”); accord id.,&para;<br>at 787 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Therefore,&para;<br>Abramski’s conviction on this count cannot stand.&para;<br>Several provisions of the Act limit the circumstances in&para;<br>which a licensed gun dealer may lawfully sell a firearm.&para;<br>Most prominently, the Act provides that no one may “sell&para;<br>or otherwise dispose of ” a firearm to a person who he&para;<br>knows or has reasonable cause to believe falls within one&para;<br>of nine prohibited categories (such as felons, fugitives,&para;<br>illegal-drug users, and the mentally ill). §922(d). But the&para;<br>Government does not contend that either Abramski or his&para;<br>uncle fell into one of those prohibited categories. And no&para;<br>provision of the Act prohibits one person who is eligible to&para;<br>receive and possess firearms (e.g., Abramski) from buying&para;<br>a gun for another person who is eligible to receive and&para;<br>possess firearms (e.g., Abramski’s uncle), even at the&para;<br>other’s request and with the other’s money.&para;<br>The Government’s contention that Abramski’s false&para;<br>statement was material to the lawfulness of the sale depends on a strained interpretation of provisions that&para;<br>mention the “person” to whom a dealer “sell[s]” (or “transfer[s],” or “deliver[s]”) a gun. A dealer may not “sell or&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

And he may not “sell or deliver” a firearm to a&para;<br>“person” who he knows or has reasonable cause to believe&para;<br>resides in a different State. §922(b)(3).&para;<br>The Government maintains that in this case Abramski’s&para;<br>uncle was the “person” to whom the dealer “s[old]” the&para;<br>gun, and that the sale consequently violated those provisions. It bases that assertion on the claim that the Gun&para;<br>Control Act implicitly incorporates “principles of agency&para;<br>law.” Brief for United States 17. Under those principles,&para;<br>it contends, the individual who walks into a dealer’s store,&para;<br>fills out the requisite forms, pays the dealer, and takes&para;<br>possession of the gun is not necessarily the “person” to&para;<br>whom the dealer “sell[s]” the gun. Instead, it says, we&para;<br>must ask whether that individual bought the gun as a&para;<br>third party’s common-law agent; if so, then the third party&para;<br>is the “person” to whom the dealer “sell[s]” the gun within&para;<br>the meaning of the relevant statutory provisions. The&para;<br>majority agrees: Although it never explicitly mentions&para;<br>agency law, it declares that if an individual is “buying a&para;<br>firearm on someone else’s behalf,” the “someone else” is&para;<br>the “person” to whom the dealer “sell[s]” the gun within&para;<br>the meaning of the statute.

That is of no moment, however,&para;<br>because Abramski’s uncle was not the “person” to whom&para;<br>the gun was “s[old].”&para;<br>The contrary interpretation provided by the Government and the majority founders on the plain language of&para;<br>the Act.

United States, 529 U. S. 848, 855 (2000);&para;<br>Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144–145 (1995). In&para;<br>ordinary usage, a vendor sells (or delivers, or transfers) an&para;<br>item of merchandise to the person who physically appears&para;<br>in his store, selects the item, pays for it, and takes possession of it. So if I give my son $10 and tell him to pick up&para;<br>milk and eggs at the store, no English speaker would say&para;<br>that the store “sells” the milk and eggs to me.2 And even if&para;<br>we were prepared to let “principles of agency law” trump&para;<br>ordinary English usage in the interpretation of this criminal statute, those principles would not require a different&para;<br>——————&para;<br>dealing with him in person, and checking his background. I doubt&para;<br>whether a falsehood that causes the dealer to neglect those procedures&para;<br>(here, by applying them to the wrong person) is material to the lawfulness of the sale within the meaning of §922(a)(6) if the sale could have&para;<br>been executed lawfully had the truth been disclosed. Moreover, if that&para;<br>were so—if a falsehood that introduced procedural error into a gun sale&para;<br>were always material to lawfulness—then §924(a)(1)(A) (discussed in&para;<br>Part II of this opinion), which prohibits making false statements with&para;<br>respect to information required to be recorded in a dealer’s records,&para;<br>would be superfluous.&para;<br>2 The majority makes the puzzling suggestion that the answer would&para;<br>be different if the sale involved consumer electronics instead of groceries.

Giving the text its plain,&para;<br>ordinary meaning, Abramski, not his uncle, was that&para;<br>“person.” That being so, the Government has identified no&para;<br>reason why the arrangement between Abramski and his&para;<br>uncle, both of whom were eligible to receive and possess&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ABRAMSKI v.

Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 461&para;<br>(2002); see Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation&para;<br>Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co.,&para;<br>514 U. S. 122, 135–136 (1995). Perhaps those whose votes&para;<br>were needed for passage of the statute wanted a lawful&para;<br>purchaser to be able to use an agent. A statute shaped by&para;<br>political tradeoffs in a controversial area may appear&para;<br>“imperfect” from some perspectives, but “our ability to&para;<br>imagine ways of redesigning the statute to advance one of&para;<br>Congress’ ends does not render it irrational.” Preseault v.&para;<br>ICC, 494 U. S. 1, 19 (1990). We must accept that Congress, balancing the conflicting demands of a divided&para;<br>citizenry, “ ‘wrote the statute it wrote’—meaning, a statute&para;<br>going so far and no further.” Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 11).&para;<br>That Abramski’s reading does not render the Act’s&para;<br>requirements “meaningless” is further evidenced by the&para;<br>fact that, for decades, even ATF itself did not read the&para;<br>statute to criminalize conduct like Abramski’s. After&para;<br>Congress passed the Act in 1968, ATF’s initial position&para;<br>was that the Act did not prohibit the sale of a gun to an&para;<br>eligible buyer acting on behalf of a third party (even an&para;<br>ineligible one). See Hearings Before the Subcommittee To&para;<br>Investigate Juvenile Delinquency of the Senate Committee&para;<br>on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, 118 (1975).&para;<br>A few years later, ATF modified its position and asserted&para;<br>that the Act did not “prohibit a dealer from making a sale&para;<br>to a person who is actually purchasing the firearm for&para;<br>another person” unless the other person was “prohibited&para;<br>from receiving or possessing a firearm,” in which case the&para;<br>dealer could be guilty of “unlawfully aiding the prohibited&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

The agency appears not to have&para;<br>adopted its current position until the early 1990’s. See&para;<br>United States v. Polk, 118 F. 3d 286, 295, n. 7 (CA5 1997).&para;<br>The majority deems this enforcement history “not relevant” because the Government’s reading of a criminal&para;<br>statute is not entitled to deference. Ante, at 22. But the&para;<br>fact that the agency charged with enforcing the Act read&para;<br>it, over a period of roughly 25 years, not to apply to the&para;<br>type of conduct at issue here is powerful evidence that&para;<br>interpreting the Act in that way is natural and reasonable&para;<br>and does not make its requirements “meaningless.”&para;<br>C&para;<br>Even if the statute were wrongly thought to be ambiguous on this point, the rule of lenity would defeat the Government’s construction. It is a “familiar principle” that&para;<br>“ ‘ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes&para;<br>should be resolved in favor of lenity.’ ” Skilling v. United&para;<br>States, 561 U. S. 358, 410 (2010). That principle prevents&para;<br>us from giving the words of a criminal statute “a meaning&para;<br>that is different from [their] ordinary, accepted meaning,&para;<br>and that disfavors the defendant.” Burrage v. United&para;<br>States, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12). And it&para;<br>means that when a criminal statute has two possible&para;<br>readings, we do not “ ‘choose the harsher alternative’ ”&para;<br>unless Congress has “ ‘spoken in language that is clear and&para;<br>definite.’ ” United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347–349&para;<br>(1971). For the reasons given above, it cannot be said that&para;<br>the statute unambiguously commands the Government’s&para;<br>current reading. It is especially contrary to sound practice&para;<br>to give this criminal statute a meaning that the Government itself rejected for years.&para;<br>The majority does not mention the rule of lenity apart&para;<br>from a footnote, ante, at 18, n. 10, responding to this dis-&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sent. The footnote concedes that “the text creates some&para;<br>ambiguity” but says that “context, structure, history, and&para;<br>purpose resolve it.” Ibid. But for the reasons given above,&para;<br>context and structure do not support the majority’s interpretation, history refutes it by showing that the Government itself interpreted the statute more leniently for&para;<br>many years, and “purpose” supports it only if one imputes&para;<br>to the statute a crime-fighting purpose broader than the&para;<br>text discloses (a practice that would nullify the rule of&para;<br>lenity in all cases). See Part I–B, supra.5 If lenity has no&para;<br>role to play in a clear case such as this one, we ought to&para;<br>stop pretending it is a genuine part of our jurisprudence.&para;<br>Contrary to the majority’s miserly approach, the rule of&para;<br>lenity applies whenever, after all legitimate tools of interpretation have been exhausted, “a reasonable doubt persists” regarding whether Congress has made the defendant’s conduct a federal crime, Moskal v. United States, 498&para;<br>U. S. 103, 108 (1990)—in other words, whenever those&para;<br>tools do not decisively dispel the statute’s ambiguity.&para;<br>Skilling, supra, at 410; see, e.g., Scheidler v.

It cannot honestly be said that the text,&para;<br>structure, and history of the Gun Control Act establish as&para;<br>“unambiguously correct” that the Act makes Abramski’s&para;<br>conduct a federal crime.&para;<br>By refusing to apply lenity here, the majority turns its&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The majority is thus entirely wrong to charge that I would apply the&para;<br>rule of lenity “because the statute’s text, taken alone, permits a narrower construction,” ante, at 18, n. 10.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Blackstone, Commentaries&para;<br>on the Laws of England 88 (1765) (“Penal statutes must be&para;<br>construed strictly”). As Chief Justice Marshall wrote, the&para;<br>rule is “founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights&para;<br>of individuals; and on the plain principle that the power of&para;<br>punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial&para;<br>department.” Wiltberger, supra, at 95. It forbids a court&para;<br>to criminalize an act simply because the court deems that&para;<br>act “of equal atrocity, or of kindred character, with those&para;<br>which are enumerated.” Id., at 96. Today’s majority&para;<br>disregards that foundational principle.&para;<br>II. Section 924(a)(1)(A)&para;<br>Under §924(a)(1)(A), it is a crime to make a “false&para;<br>statement . . . with respect to the information required by&para;<br>this chapter to be kept in the records of ” a federally licensed gun dealer (emphasis added). “[T]his chapter”&para;<br>refers to chapter 44 of title 18 of the United States Code,&para;<br>which contains the Gun Control Act. §§921–931.&para;<br>The question Abramski answered falsely was whether&para;<br>he was buying the gun for someone else. Did the Act itself&para;<br>require the dealer to record this information? It did not; it&para;<br>simply required him to record “the name, age, and place of&para;<br>residence” of the “person” to whom the firearm was “s[old]&para;<br>or deliver[ed].” §922(b)(5). As explained above, that “person” was Abramski, not his uncle. See Part I, supra.&para;<br>But, the majority says, the Act also directs dealers to&para;<br>“ ‘maintain such records . . . as the Attorney General may&para;<br>by regulations prescribe.’ ”&para;<br>Ante, at 22 (quoting&para;<br>§923(g)(1)(A)). So did a regulation require this information to be recorded? Again, no. The relevant regulation&para;<br>provides that a dealer shall&para;<br>“obtain a Form 4473 from the transferee showing the&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>ABRAMSKI v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>transferee’s name, sex, residence address (including&para;<br>county or similar political subdivision), date and place&para;<br>of birth; height, weight and race of the transferee; the&para;<br>transferee’s country of citizenship; the transferee’s&para;<br>INS-issued alien number or admission number; the&para;<br>transferee’s State of residence; and certification by the&para;<br>transferee that the transferee is not prohibited by the&para;<br>Act from transporting or shipping a firearm in interstate or foreign commerce or receiving a firearm&para;<br>which has been shipped or transported in interstate or&para;<br>foreign commerce or possessing a firearm in or affecting commerce.” 27 CFR §478.124(c)(1) (2014).&para;<br>The long list of information that this regulation requires&para;<br>to be kept in the dealer’s records does not include whether&para;<br>the transferee is buying the gun for an eligible third party.&para;<br>But wait! the majority says: Another provision of the&para;<br>regulation requires a dealer to “ ‘retain . . . as part of [its]&para;<br>required records, each Form 4473 obtained in the course&para;<br>of ’ ” selling or disposing of a firearm. Ante, at 23 (quoting&para;<br>27 CFR §478.124(a)). Therefore, according to the majority,&para;<br>any “false answer on that Form”—even an answer to a&para;<br>question that is not among those enumerated in the regulation—necessarily “pertains to information a dealer is&para;<br>statutorily required to maintain.” Ante, at 23.&para;<br>That carries the text of the statute a bridge too far. On&para;<br>the majority’s view, if the bureaucrats responsible for&para;<br>creating Form 4473 decided to ask about the buyer’s favorite color, a false response would be a federal crime. That&para;<br>is not what the statute says. The statute punishes misstatements “with respect to information required to be&para;<br>kept,” §924(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added), not with respect to&para;<br>“information contained in forms required to be kept.”&para;<br>Because neither the Act nor any regulation requires a&para;<br>dealer to keep a record of whether a customer is purchasing a gun for himself or for an eligible third party, that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>question had no place on Form 4473—any more than&para;<br>would the question whether the customer was purchasing&para;<br>the gun as a gift for a particular individual and, if so, who&para;<br>that individual was. And the statute no more criminalizes&para;<br>a false answer to an ultra vires question on Form 4473&para;<br>than it criminalizes the purchaser’s volunteering of a false&para;<br>e-mail address on that form. Information regarding&para;<br>Abramski’s status as a “straw purchaser” was not “information required to be kept,” and that is an end of the&para;<br>matter. In my view, that is the best—indeed, the only&para;<br>plausible—interpretation of §924(a)(1)(A). But at a minimum, the statute is ambiguous, and lenity does the rest.&para;<br>See Part I–C, supra.6&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The Court makes it a federal crime for one lawful gun&para;<br>owner to buy a gun for another lawful gun owner. Whether&para;<br>or not that is a sensible result, the statutes Congress&para;<br>enacted do not support it—especially when, as is appropriate, we resolve ambiguity in those statutes in favor of&para;<br>the accused. I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The&para;<br>&para;<br>majority professes that it “need not, and do[es] not, opine on”&para;<br>whether it would impose liability for “a false answer even to an ‘ultra&para;<br>vires question’ ” because, given its reasoning on Count One, the question at issue here was “part and parcel of the dealer’s determination of&para;<br>the (true) buyer’s ‘name, age, and place of residence,’ which §922(b)(5)&para;<br>requires the dealer to keep.” Ante, at 23, n. 11. But if that is really all&para;<br>the majority means to decide, then why bother to invoke the requirement that the dealer keep such records as the regulations prescribe and&para;<br>the regulation requiring the dealer to keep Form 4473? See ante, at&para;<br>22–23. If the majority’s ruling is as limited as it claims, it ought to cite&para;<br>§922(b)(5) and be done.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
