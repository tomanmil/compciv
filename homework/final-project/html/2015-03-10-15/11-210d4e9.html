S. C. §§704 (b), (c).&para;<br>Respondent pleaded guilty to a charge of falsely claiming that he had&para;<br>received the Medal of Honor, but reserved his right to appeal his&para;<br>claim that the Act is unconstitutional. The Ninth Circuit reversed,&para;<br>finding the Act invalid under the First Amendment.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is affirmed. Pp. 3−18.&para;<br>617 F. 3d 1198, affirmed.&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE GINSBURG,&para;<br>and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concluded that the Act infringes upon&para;<br>speech protected by the First Amendment. Pp. 3–18.&para;<br>(a) The Constitution “demands that content-based restrictions on&para;<br>speech be presumed invalid . . . and that the Government bear the&para;<br>burden of showing their constitutionality.” Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 542 U. S. 656, 660.&para;<br>Content-based restrictions on speech have been permitted only for&para;<br>a few historic categories of speech, including incitement, obscenity,&para;<br>defamation, speech integral to criminal conduct, so-called “fighting&para;<br>words,” child pornography, fraud, true threats, and speech presenting&para;<br>some grave and imminent threat the Government has the power to&para;<br>prevent.&para;<br>Absent from these few categories is any general exception for false&para;<br>statements. The Government argues that cases such as Hustler&para;<br>Magazine, Inc., v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 52, support its claim that&para;<br>false statements have no value and hence no First Amendment protection. But all the Government’s quotations derive from cases dis-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>cussing defamation, fraud, or some other legally cognizable harm associated with a false statement. In those decisions the falsity of the&para;<br>speech at issue was not irrelevant to the Court’s analysis, but neither&para;<br>was it determinative. These prior decisions have not confronted a&para;<br>measure, like the Stolen Valor Act, that targets falsity and nothing&para;<br>more.&para;<br>Even when considering some instances of defamation or fraud, the&para;<br>Court has instructed that falsity alone may not suffice to bring the&para;<br>speech outside the First Amendment; the statement must be a knowing and reckless falsehood. See New York Times v. Sullivan, 376&para;<br>U. S. 254, 280. Here, the Government seeks to convert a rule that&para;<br>limits liability even in defamation cases where the law permits recovery for tortious wrongs into a rule that expands liability in a different, far greater realm of discourse and expression.&para;<br>The Government’s three examples of false-speech regulation that&para;<br>courts generally have found permissible do not establish a principle&para;<br>that all proscriptions of false statements are exempt from rigorous&para;<br>First Amendment scrutiny. The criminal prohibition of a false&para;<br>statement made to Government officials in communications concerning official matters, 18 U. S. C. §1001, does not lead to the broader&para;<br>proposition that false statements are unprotected when made to any&para;<br>person, at any time, in any context. As for perjury statutes, perjured&para;<br>statements lack First Amendment protection not simply because they&para;<br>are false, but because perjury undermines the function and province&para;<br>of the law and threatens the integrity of judgments. Finally, there&para;<br>are statutes that prohibit falsely representing that one is speaking on&para;<br>behalf of the Government, or prohibit impersonating a Government&para;<br>officer. These examples, to the extent that they implicate fraud or&para;<br>speech integral to criminal conduct, are inapplicable here.&para;<br>While there may exist “some categories of speech that have been&para;<br>historically unprotected,” but that the Court has not yet specifically&para;<br>identified or discussed, United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___,&para;<br>the Government has not demonstrated that false statements should&para;<br>constitute a new category. Pp. 3−10.&para;<br>(b) The Act seeks to control and suppress all false statements on&para;<br>this one subject in almost limitless times and settings without regard&para;<br>to whether the lie was made for the purpose of material gain. Permitting the Government to decree this speech to be a criminal offense&para;<br>would endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects&para;<br>about which false statements are punishable. That governmental&para;<br>power has no clear limiting principle. Pp. 10−11.&para;<br>(c) The Court applies the “most exacting scrutiny” in assessing content-based restrictions on protected speech. Turner Broadcasting&para;<br>System Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 642. The Act does not satisfy that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>scrutiny. While the Government’s interest in protecting the integrity&para;<br>of the Medal of Honor is beyond question, the First Amendment requires that there be a direct causal link between the restriction imposed and the injury to be prevented. Here, that link has not been&para;<br>shown. The Government points to no evidence supporting its claim&para;<br>that the public’s general perception of military awards is diluted by&para;<br>false claims such as those made by respondent. And it has not&para;<br>shown, and cannot show, why counterspeech, such as the ridicule respondent received online and in the press, would not suffice to&para;<br>achieve its interest.&para;<br>In addition, when the Government seeks to regulate protected&para;<br>speech, the restriction must be the “least restrictive means among&para;<br>available, effective alternatives.” Ashcroft, 542 U. S., at 666. Here,&para;<br>the Government could likely protect the integrity of the military&para;<br>awards system by creating a database of Medal winners accessible&para;<br>and searchable on the Internet, as some private individuals have already done. Pp. 12−18.&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER, joined by JUSTICE KAGAN, concluded that because&para;<br>the Stolen Valor Act, as presently drafted, works disproportionate&para;<br>constitutional harm, it fails intermediate scrutiny, and thus violates&para;<br>the First Amendment. Pp. 1−10.&para;<br>(a) In determining whether a statute violates the First Amendment, the Court has often found it appropriate to examine the fit between statutory ends and means, taking into account the seriousness&para;<br>of the speech-related harm the provision will likely cause, the nature&para;<br>and importance of the provision’s countervailing objectives, the extent to which the statute will tend to achieve those objectives, and&para;<br>whether there are other, less restrictive alternatives. “Intermediate&para;<br>scrutiny” describes this approach. Since false factual statements are&para;<br>less likely than true factual statements to make a valuable contribution to the marketplace of ideas, and the government often has good&para;<br>reason to prohibit such false speech, but its regulation can threaten&para;<br>speech-related harm, such an approach is applied here. Pp. 1−3.&para;<br>(b) The Act should be read as criminalizing only false factual&para;<br>statements made with knowledge of their falsity and with intent that&para;<br>they be taken as true. Although the Court has frequently said or implied that false factual statements enjoy little First Amendment protection, see, e.g., Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 340, those&para;<br>statements cannot be read to mean “no protection at all.” False factual statements serve useful human objectives in many contexts.&para;<br>Moreover, the threat of criminal prosecution for making a false&para;<br>statement can inhibit the speaker from making true statements,&para;<br>thereby “chilling” a kind of speech that lies at the First Amendment’s&para;<br>heart. See id., at 340−341. And the pervasiveness of false factual&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>statements provides a weapon to a government broadly empowered to&para;<br>prosecute falsity without more. Those who are unpopular may fear&para;<br>that the government will use that weapon selectively against them.&para;<br>Although there are many statutes and common-law doctrines making the utterance of certain kinds of false statements unlawful, they&para;<br>tend to be narrower than the Act, in that they limit the scope of their&para;<br>application in various ways, for example, by requiring proof of specific harm to identifiable victims. The Act lacks any such limiting features. Although it prohibits only knowing and intentional falsehoods&para;<br>about readily verifiable facts within the personal knowledge of the&para;<br>speaker, it otherwise ranges broadly, and that breadth means that it&para;<br>creates a significant risk of First Amendment harm. Pp. 3−8.&para;<br>(c) The Act nonetheless has substantial justification. It seeks to&para;<br>protect the interests of those who have sacrificed their health and life&para;<br>for their country by seeking to preserve intact the country’s recognition of that sacrifice in the form of military honors. P. 8.&para;<br>(d) It may, however, be possible substantially to achieve the Government’s objective in less burdensome ways. The First Amendment&para;<br>risks flowing from the Act’s breadth of coverage could be diminished&para;<br>or eliminated by a more finely tailored statute, for example, a statute&para;<br>that requires a showing that the false statement caused specific harm&para;<br>or is focused on lies more likely to be harmful or on contexts where&para;<br>such lies are likely to cause harm. Pp. 8−10.&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an&para;<br>opinion, in which ROBERTS, C. J., and GINSBURG and SOTOMAYOR, JJ.,&para;<br>joined.

Xavier Alvarez, the respondent&para;<br>here, lied when he said that he played hockey for the&para;<br>Detroit Red Wings and that he once married a starlet from&para;<br>Mexico. But when he lied in announcing he held the Congressional Medal of Honor, respondent ventured onto new&para;<br>ground; for that lie violates a federal criminal statute, the&para;<br>Stolen Valor Act of 2005. 18 U. S. C. §704.&para;<br>In 2007, respondent attended his first public meeting as&para;<br>a board member of the Three Valley Water District Board.&para;<br>The board is a governmental entity with headquarters in&para;<br>Claremont, California. He introduced himself as follows:&para;<br>“I’m a retired marine of 25 years. I retired in the year 2001.&para;<br>Back in 1987, I was awarded the Congressional Medal of&para;<br>Honor. I got wounded many times by the same guy.” 617&para;<br>F. 3d 1198, 1201–1202 (CA9 2010). None of this was true.&para;<br>For all the record shows, respondent’s statements were&para;<br>but a pathetic attempt to gain respect that eluded him.&para;<br>The statements do not seem to have been made to secure&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>employment or financial benefits or admission to privileges&para;<br>reserved for those who had earned the Medal.&para;<br>Respondent was indicted under the Stolen Valor Act&para;<br>for lying about the Congressional Medal of Honor at the&para;<br>meeting. The United States District Court for the Central&para;<br>District of California rejected his claim that the statute is&para;<br>invalid under the First Amendment. Respondent pleaded&para;<br>guilty to one count, reserving the right to appeal on his&para;<br>First Amendment claim. The United States Court of&para;<br>Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in a decision by a divided&para;<br>panel, found the Act invalid under the First Amendment&para;<br>and reversed the conviction. Id., at 1218. With further&para;<br>opinions on the issue, and over a dissent by seven judges,&para;<br>rehearing en banc was denied. 638 F. 3d 666 (2011). This&para;<br>Court granted certiorari. 565 U. S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>After certiorari was granted, and in an unrelated case,&para;<br>the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,&para;<br>also in a decision by a divided panel, found the Act constitutional. United States v. Strandlof, 667 F. 3d 1146&para;<br>(2012). So there is now a conflict in the Courts of Appeals&para;<br>on the question of the Act’s validity.&para;<br>This is the second case in two Terms requiring the Court&para;<br>to consider speech that can disparage, or attempt to steal,&para;<br>honor that belongs to those who fought for this Nation in&para;<br>battle. See Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S. ___ (2011) (hateful&para;<br>protests directed at the funeral of a serviceman who died&para;<br>in Iraq). Here the statement that the speaker held the&para;<br>Medal was an intended, undoubted lie.&para;<br>It is right and proper that Congress, over a century ago,&para;<br>established an award so the Nation can hold in its highest respect and esteem those who, in the course of carrying&para;<br>out the “supreme and noble duty of contributing to the&para;<br>defense of the rights and honor of the nation,” Selective&para;<br>Draft Law Cases, 245 U. S. 366, 390 (1918), have acted&para;<br>with extraordinary honor. And it should be uncontested&para;<br>that this is a legitimate Government objective, indeed a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>most valued national aspiration and purpose. This does&para;<br>not end the inquiry, however. Fundamental constitutional&para;<br>principles require that laws enacted to honor the brave&para;<br>must be consistent with the precepts of the Constitution&para;<br>for which they fought.&para;<br>The Government contends the criminal prohibition is&para;<br>a proper means to further its purpose in creating and&para;<br>awarding the Medal. When content-based speech regulation is in question, however, exacting scrutiny is required.&para;<br>Statutes suppressing or restricting speech must be judged&para;<br>by the sometimes inconvenient principles of the First&para;<br>Amendment. By this measure, the statutory provisions&para;<br>under which respondent was convicted must be held invalid, and his conviction must be set aside.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Respondent’s claim to hold the Congressional Medal of&para;<br>Honor was false. There is no room to argue about interpretation or shades of meaning. On this premise, respondent violated §704(b); and, because the lie concerned&para;<br>the Congressional Medal of Honor, he was subject to an&para;<br>enhanced penalty under subsection (c). Those statutory&para;<br>provisions are as follows:&para;<br>“(b) FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT RECEIPT OF MILITARY&para;<br>DECORATIONS OR MEDALS.––Whoever falsely represents himself or herself, verbally or in writing, to have&para;<br>been awarded any decoration or medal authorized by&para;<br>Congress for the Armed Forces of the United States&para;<br>. . . shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not&para;<br>more than six months, or both.&para;<br>“(c) ENHANCED PENALTY FOR OFFENSES INVOLVING&para;<br>CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR.––&para;<br>“(1) IN GENERAL.––If a decoration or medal involved&para;<br>in an offense under subsection (a) or (b) is a Congressional Medal of Honor, in lieu of the punishment provided&para;<br>in that subsection, the offender shall be fined under&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>this title, imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.”&para;<br>Respondent challenges the statute as a content-based&para;<br>suppression of pure speech, speech not falling within any&para;<br>of the few categories of expression where content-based&para;<br>regulation is permissible. The Government defends the&para;<br>statute as necessary to preserve the integrity and purpose&para;<br>of the Medal, an integrity and purpose it contends are&para;<br>compromised and frustrated by the false statements the&para;<br>statute prohibits. It argues that false statements “have&para;<br>no First Amendment value in themselves,” and thus “are&para;<br>protected only to the extent needed to avoid chilling fully&para;<br>protected speech.” Brief for United States 18, 20. Although the statute covers respondent’s speech, the Government argues that it leaves breathing room for protected speech, for example speech which might criticize&para;<br>the idea of the Medal or the importance of the military.&para;<br>The Government’s arguments cannot suffice to save the&para;<br>statute.&para;<br>II&para;<br>“[A]s a general matter, the First Amendment means&para;<br>that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its&para;<br>content.” Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 535&para;<br>U. S. 564, 573 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>As a result, the Constitution “demands that content-based&para;<br>restrictions on speech be presumed invalid . . . and that&para;<br>the Government bear the burden of showing their constitutionality.” Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union,&para;<br>542 U. S. 656, 660 (2004).&para;<br>In light of the substantial and expansive threats to free&para;<br>expression posed by content-based restrictions, this Court&para;<br>has rejected as “startling and dangerous” a “free-floating&para;<br>test for First Amendment coverage . . . [based on] an&para;<br>ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits.”&para;<br>United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op.,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>at 7). Instead, content-based restrictions on speech have&para;<br>been permitted, as a general matter, only when confined&para;<br>to the few “ ‘historic and traditional categories [of expression] long familiar to the bar,’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5)&para;<br>(quoting Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State&para;<br>Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 127 (1991) (KENNEDY,&para;<br>J., concurring in judgment)). Among these categories are&para;<br>advocacy intended, and likely, to incite imminent lawless&para;<br>action, see Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444 (1969)&para;<br>(per curiam); obscenity, see, e.g., Miller v. California, 413&para;<br>U. S. 15 (1973); defamation, see, e.g., New York Times Co.&para;<br>v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964) (providing substantial&para;<br>protection for speech about public figures); Gertz v. Robert&para;<br>Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974) (imposing some limits on&para;<br>liability for defaming a private figure); speech integral to&para;<br>criminal conduct, see, e.g., Giboney v. Empire Storage &amp;&para;<br>Ice Co., 336 U. S. 490 (1949); so-called “fighting words,”&para;<br>see Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568 (1942);&para;<br>child pornography, see New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747&para;<br>(1982); fraud, see Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia&para;<br>Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 771 (1976);&para;<br>true threats, see Watts v. United States, 394 U. S. 705&para;<br>(1969) (per curiam); and speech presenting some grave&para;<br>and imminent threat the government has the power to&para;<br>prevent, see Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S.&para;<br>697, 716 (1931), although a restriction under the last&para;<br>category is most difficult to sustain, see New York Times&para;<br>Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713 (1971) (per curiam).&para;<br>These categories have a historical foundation in the&para;<br>Court’s free speech tradition. The vast realm of free&para;<br>speech and thought always protected in our tradition can&para;<br>still thrive, and even be furthered, by adherence to those&para;<br>categories and rules.&para;<br>Absent from those few categories where the law allows&para;<br>content-based regulation of speech is any general exception to the First Amendment for false statements. This&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>comports with the common understanding that some false&para;<br>statements are inevitable if there is to be an open and&para;<br>vigorous expression of views in public and private conversation, expression the First Amendment seeks to guarantee. See Sullivan, supra, at 271 (“Th[e] erroneous&para;<br>statement is inevitable in free debate”).&para;<br>The Government disagrees with this proposition. It&para;<br>cites language from some of this Court’s precedents to&para;<br>support its contention that false statements have no value&para;<br>and hence no First Amendment protection. See also Brief&para;<br>for Eugene Volokh et al. as Amici Curiae 2–11. These&para;<br>isolated statements in some earlier decisions do not support the Government’s submission that false statements,&para;<br>as a general rule, are beyond constitutional protection.&para;<br>That conclusion would take the quoted language far from&para;<br>its proper context. For instance, the Court has stated&para;<br>“[f]alse statements of fact are particularly valueless [because] they interfere with the truth-seeking function of&para;<br>the marketplace of ideas,” Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 52 (1988), and that false statements&para;<br>“are not protected by the First Amendment in the same&para;<br>manner as truthful statements,” Brown v. Hartlage, 456&para;<br>U. S. 45, 60–61 (1982). See also, e.g., Virginia Bd. of&para;<br>Pharmacy, supra, at 771 (“Untruthful speech, commercial&para;<br>or otherwise, has never been protected for its own sake”);&para;<br>Herbert v. Lando, 441 U. S. 153, 171 (1979) (“Spreading&para;<br>false information in and of itself carries no First Amendment credentials”); Gertz, supra, at 340 (“[T]here is no&para;<br>constitutional value in false statements of fact”); Garrison&para;<br>v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64, 75 (1964) (“[T]he knowingly&para;<br>false statement and the false statement made with reckless disregard of the truth, do not enjoy constitutional&para;<br>protection”).&para;<br>These quotations all derive from cases discussing defamation, fraud, or some other legally cognizable harm&para;<br>associated with a false statement, such as an invasion of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>privacy or the costs of vexatious litigation. See Brief for&para;<br>United States 18–19. In those decisions the falsity of&para;<br>the speech at issue was not irrelevant to our analysis, but&para;<br>neither was it determinative. The Court has never endorsed the categorical rule the Government advances: that&para;<br>false statements receive no First Amendment protection.&para;<br>Our prior decisions have not confronted a measure, like&para;<br>the Stolen Valor Act, that targets falsity and nothing&para;<br>more.&para;<br>Even when considering some instances of defamation&para;<br>and fraud, moreover, the Court has been careful to instruct that falsity alone may not suffice to bring the&para;<br>speech outside the First Amendment. The statement must&para;<br>be a knowing or reckless falsehood. See Sullivan, supra,&para;<br>at 280 (prohibiting recovery of damages for a defamatory&para;<br>falsehood made about a public official unless the statement was made “with knowledge that it was false or with&para;<br>reckless disregard of whether it was false or not”); see&para;<br>also Garrison, supra, at 73 (“[E]ven when the utterance is&para;<br>false, the great principles of the Constitution which secure&para;<br>freedom of expression . . . preclude attaching adverse&para;<br>consequences to any except the knowing or reckless falsehood”); Illinois ex rel. Madigan v. Telemarketing Associates, Inc., 538 U. S. 600, 620 (2003) (“False statement&para;<br>alone does not subject a fundraiser to fraud liability”).&para;<br>The Government thus seeks to use this principle for a&para;<br>new purpose. It seeks to convert a rule that limits liability&para;<br>even in defamation cases where the law permits recovery&para;<br>for tortious wrongs into a rule that expands liability in a&para;<br>different, far greater realm of discourse and expression.&para;<br>That inverts the rationale for the exception. The requirements of a knowing falsehood or reckless disregard for the&para;<br>truth as the condition for recovery in certain defamation&para;<br>cases exists to allow more speech, not less. A rule designed to tolerate certain speech ought not blossom to&para;<br>become a rationale for a rule restricting it.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>The Government then gives three examples of regulations on false speech that courts generally have found permissible: first, the criminal prohibition of a false statement made to a Government official, 18 U. S. C. §1001;&para;<br>second, laws punishing perjury; and third, prohibitions on the false representation that one is speaking as a&para;<br>Government official or on behalf of the Government, see,&para;<br>e.g., §912; §709. These restrictions, however, do not establish a principle that all proscriptions of false statements&para;<br>are exempt from exacting First Amendment scrutiny.&para;<br>The federal statute prohibiting false statements to&para;<br>Government officials punishes “whoever, in any matter&para;<br>within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or&para;<br>judicial branch of the Government . . . makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation.” §1001. Section 1001’s prohibition on false&para;<br>statements made to Government officials, in communications concerning official matters, does not lead to the broader&para;<br>proposition that false statements are unprotected when&para;<br>made to any person, at any time, in any context.&para;<br>The same point can be made about what the Court has&para;<br>confirmed is the “unquestioned constitutionality of perjury&para;<br>statutes,” both the federal statute, §1623, and its state-law&para;<br>equivalents. United States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 54&para;<br>(1978). See also Konigsberg v. State Bar of Cal., 366 U. S.&para;<br>36, 51, n. 10 (1961). It is not simply because perjured&para;<br>statements are false that they lack First Amendment&para;<br>protection. Perjured testimony “is at war with justice”&para;<br>because it can cause a court to render a “judgment not&para;<br>resting on truth.” In re Michael, 326 U. S. 224, 227 (1945).&para;<br>Perjury undermines the function and province of the law&para;<br>and threatens the integrity of judgments that are the&para;<br>basis of the legal system. See United States v. Dunnigan,&para;<br>507 U. S. 87, 97 (1993) (“To uphold the integrity of our&para;<br>trial system . . . the constitutionality of perjury statutes is&para;<br>unquestioned”).

Sworn testimony&para;<br>is quite distinct from lies not spoken under oath and simply intended to puff up oneself.&para;<br>Statutes that prohibit falsely representing that one is&para;<br>speaking on behalf of the Government, or that prohibit impersonating a Government officer, also protect the integrity of Government processes, quite apart from merely&para;<br>restricting false speech. Title 18 U. S. C. §912, for example, prohibits impersonating an officer or employee of&para;<br>the United States. Even if that statute may not require&para;<br>proving an “actual financial or property loss” resulting&para;<br>from the deception, the statute is itself confined to “maintain[ing] the general good repute and dignity of . . . government . . . service itself.” United States v. Lepowitch,&para;<br>318 U. S. 702, 704 (1943) (internal quotation marks omitted). The same can be said for prohibitions on the unauthorized use of the names of federal agencies such as the&para;<br>Federal Bureau of Investigation in a manner calculated to&para;<br>convey that the communication is approved, see §709, or&para;<br>using words such as “Federal” or “United States” in the&para;<br>collection of private debts in order to convey that the&para;<br>communication has official authorization, see §712. These&para;<br>examples, to the extent that they implicate fraud or&para;<br>speech integral to criminal conduct, are inapplicable here.&para;<br>As our law and tradition show, then, there are instances&para;<br>in which the falsity of speech bears upon whether it is&para;<br>protected. Some false speech may be prohibited even if&para;<br>analogous true speech could not be. This opinion does not&para;<br>imply that any of these targeted prohibitions are somehow&para;<br>vulnerable. But it also rejects the notion that false speech&para;<br>should be in a general category that is presumptively&para;<br>unprotected.&para;<br>Although the First Amendment stands against any&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

Before exempting a category of&para;<br>speech from the normal prohibition on content-based restrictions, however, the Court must be presented with “persuasive evidence that a novel restriction on content is&para;<br>part of a long (if heretofore unrecognized) tradition of&para;<br>proscription,” Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn.,&para;<br>564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 4).

It can be&para;<br>assumed that it would not apply to, say, a theatrical performance. See Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U. S.&para;<br>1, 20 (1990) (recognizing that some statements nominally&para;<br>purporting to contain false facts in reality “cannot reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual” (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).&para;<br>Still, the sweeping, quite unprecedented reach of the&para;<br>statute puts it in conflict with the First Amendment. Here&para;<br>the lie was made in a public meeting, but the statute&para;<br>would apply with equal force to personal, whispered conversations within a home. The statute seeks to control&para;<br>and suppress all false statements on this one subject in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>almost limitless times and settings. And it does so entirely without regard to whether the lie was made for the&para;<br>purpose of material gain. See San Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483 U. S. 522,&para;<br>539–540 (1987) (prohibiting a nonprofit corporation from&para;<br>exploiting the “commercial magnetism” of the word “Olympic” when organizing an athletic competition (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>Permitting the government to decree this speech to be&para;<br>a criminal offense, whether shouted from the rooftops or&para;<br>made in a barely audible whisper, would endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects about which&para;<br>false statements are punishable. That governmental&para;<br>power has no clear limiting principle. Our constitutional&para;<br>tradition stands against the idea that we need Oceania’s&para;<br>Ministry of Truth. See G. Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four&para;<br>(1949) (Centennial ed. 2003). Were this law to be sustained, there could be an endless list of subjects the National Government or the States could single out. Where&para;<br>false claims are made to effect a fraud or secure moneys&para;<br>or other valuable considerations, say offers of employment,&para;<br>it is well established that the Government may restrict&para;<br>speech without affronting the First Amendment. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U. S., at 771 (noting that&para;<br>fraudulent speech generally falls outside the protections of&para;<br>the First Amendment). But the Stolen Valor Act is not so&para;<br>limited in its reach. Were the Court to hold that the interest in truthful discourse alone is sufficient to sustain a&para;<br>ban on speech, absent any evidence that the speech was&para;<br>used to gain a material advantage, it would give government a broad censorial power unprecedented in this&para;<br>Court’s cases or in our constitutional tradition. The mere&para;<br>potential for the exercise of that power casts a chill, a chill&para;<br>the First Amendment cannot permit if free speech,&para;<br>thought, and discourse are to remain a foundation of our&para;<br>freedom.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The previous discussion suffices to show that the Act&para;<br>conflicts with free speech principles. But even when examined within its own narrow sphere of operation, the Act&para;<br>cannot survive. In assessing content-based restrictions&para;<br>on protected speech, the Court has not adopted a freewheeling approach, see Stevens, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 7) (“The First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech&para;<br>does not extend only to categories of speech that survive&para;<br>an ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits”),&para;<br>but rather has applied the “most exacting scrutiny.”&para;<br>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622,&para;<br>642 (1994). Although the objectives the Government seeks&para;<br>to further by the statute are not without significance, the&para;<br>Court must, and now does, find the Act does not satisfy&para;<br>exacting scrutiny.&para;<br>The Government is correct when it states military medals “serve the important public function of recognizing and&para;<br>expressing gratitude for acts of heroism and sacrifice in&para;<br>military service,” and also “ ‘foste[r] morale, mission accomplishment and esprit de corps’ among service members.” Brief for United States 37, 38. General George&para;<br>Washington observed that an award for valor would “cherish a virtuous ambition in . . . soldiers, as well as foster&para;<br>and encourage every species of military merit.” General&para;<br>Orders of George Washington Issued at Newburgh on the&para;<br>Hudson, 1782–1783 (Aug. 7, 1782), p. 30 (E. Boynton ed.&para;<br>1883). Time has not diminished this idea. In periods of&para;<br>war and peace alike public recognition of valor and noble&para;<br>sacrifice by men and women in uniform reinforces the&para;<br>pride and national resolve that the military relies upon to&para;<br>fulfill its mission.&para;<br>These interests are related to the integrity of the military honors system in general, and the Congressional&para;<br>Medal of Honor in particular. Although millions have&para;<br>served with brave resolve, the Medal, which is the highest&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

It must be acknowledged&para;<br>that when a pretender claims the Medal to be his own, the&para;<br>lie might harm the Government by demeaning the high&para;<br>purpose of the award, diminishing the honor it confirms,&para;<br>and creating the appearance that the Medal is awarded&para;<br>more often than is true. Furthermore, the lie may offend&para;<br>the true holders of the Medal. From one perspective it insults their bravery and high principles when falsehood&para;<br>puts them in the unworthy company of a pretender.&para;<br>Yet these interests do not satisfy the Government’s&para;<br>heavy burden when it seeks to regulate protected speech.&para;<br>See United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.,&para;<br>529 U. S. 803, 818 (2000). The Government points to no&para;<br>evidence to support its claim that the public’s general&para;<br>perception of military awards is diluted by false claims&para;<br>such as those made by Alvarez. Cf. Entertainment Merchants Assn., supra, at ___–___ (slip op., at 12–13) (analyzing and rejecting the findings of research psychologists&para;<br>demonstrating the causal link between violent video&para;<br>games and harmful effects on children).

The Government has not shown,&para;<br>and cannot show, why counterspeech would not suffice to&para;<br>achieve its interest. The facts of this case indicate that&para;<br>the dynamics of free speech, of counterspeech, of refutation, can overcome the lie. Respondent lied at a public&para;<br>meeting. Even before the FBI began investigating him for&para;<br>his false statements “Alvarez was perceived as a phony,”&para;<br>617 F. 3d, at 1211. Once the lie was made public, he was&para;<br>ridiculed online, see Brief for Respondent 3, his actions&para;<br>were reported in the press, see Ortega, Alvarez Again&para;<br>Denies Claim, Ontario, CA, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin&para;<br>(Sept. 27, 2007), and a fellow board member called for his&para;<br>resignation, see, e.g., Bigham, Water District Rep Requests Alvarez Resign in Wake of False Medal Claim,&para;<br>San Bernardino Cty., CA, The Sun (May 21, 2008). There&para;<br>is good reason to believe that a similar fate would befall&para;<br>other false claimants. See Brief for Reporters Committee&para;<br>for Freedom of the Press et al. as Amici Curiae 30–33&para;<br>(listing numerous examples of public exposure of false&para;<br>claimants). Indeed, the outrage and contempt expressed&para;<br>for respondent’s lies can serve to reawaken and reinforce&para;<br>the public’s respect for the Medal, its recipients, and its&para;<br>high purpose. The acclaim that recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor receive also casts doubt on the&para;<br>proposition that the public will be misled by the claims of&para;<br>charlatans or become cynical of those whose heroic deeds&para;<br>earned them the Medal by right. See, e.g., Well Done,&para;<br>Washington Post, Feb. 5, 1943, p. 8 (reporting on President Roosevelt’s awarding the Congressional Medal of&para;<br>Honor to Maj. Gen.

The theory of&para;<br>our Constitution is “that the best test of truth is the power&para;<br>of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of&para;<br>the market,” Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616, 630&para;<br>(1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting). The First Amendment&para;<br>itself ensures the right to respond to speech we do not like,&para;<br>and for good reason. Freedom of speech and thought flows&para;<br>not from the beneficence of the state but from the inalienable rights of the person. And suppression of speech by&para;<br>the government can make exposure of falsity more difficult, not less so. Society has the right and civic duty to&para;<br>engage in open, dynamic, rational discourse. These ends&para;<br>are not well served when the government seeks to orchestrate public discussion through content-based mandates.&para;<br>Expressing its concern that counterspeech is insufficient, the Government responds that because “some&para;<br>military records have been lost . . . some claims [are] unverifiable,” Brief for United States 50. This proves little,&para;<br>however; for without verifiable records, successful criminal prosecution under the Act would be more difficult in&para;<br>any event. So, in cases where public refutation will not&para;<br>serve the Government’s interest, the Act will not either.&para;<br>In addition, the Government claims that “many [false&para;<br>claims] will remain unchallenged.” Id., at 55. The Government provides no support for the contention. And in&para;<br>any event, in order to show that public refutation is not an&para;<br>adequate alternative, the Government must demonstrate&para;<br>that unchallenged claims undermine the public’s perception of the military and the integrity of its awards system.&para;<br>This showing has not been made.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

The same can be said for the Government’s interest. The American people do not need the assistance of a&para;<br>government prosecution to express their high regard for&para;<br>the special place that military heroes hold in our tradition.

In&para;<br>doing so, it has examined speech-related harms, justifications, and potential alternatives.

ALVAREZ&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>tion only upon a showing of “ ‘actual malice’ ”). As so interpreted the statute covers only lies. But although this&para;<br>interpretation diminishes the extent to which the statute&para;<br>endangers First Amendment values, it does not eliminate&para;<br>the threat.&para;<br>I must concede, as the Government points out, that this&para;<br>Court has frequently said or implied that false factual&para;<br>statements enjoy little First Amendment protection. See,&para;<br>e.g., BE&amp;K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536 U. S. 516, 531 (2002)&para;<br>(“[F]alse statements may be unprotected for their own&para;<br>sake”); Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.

See, e.g., Gertz, supra, at 340–341. Hence,&para;<br>the Court emphasizes mens rea requirements that provide&para;<br>“breathing room” for more valuable speech by reducing an&para;<br>honest speaker’s fear that he may accidentally incur liability for speaking.&para;<br>Further, the pervasiveness of false statements, made&para;<br>for better or for worse motives, made thoughtlessly or deliberately, made with or without accompanying harm,&para;<br>provides a weapon to a government broadly empowered to&para;<br>prosecute falsity without more.

Those prohibitions, however, tend to&para;<br>be narrower than the statute before us, in that they limit&para;<br>the scope of their application, sometimes by requiring&para;<br>proof of specific harm to identifiable victims; sometimes by&para;<br>specifying that the lies be made in contexts in which a&para;<br>tangible harm to others is especially likely to occur; and&para;<br>sometimes by limiting the prohibited lies to those that are&para;<br>particularly likely to produce harm.&para;<br>Fraud statutes, for example, typically require proof of a&para;<br>misrepresentation that is material, upon which the victim&para;<br>relied, and which caused actual injury. See Restatement&para;<br>(Second) of Torts §525 (1976). Defamation statutes focus&para;<br>upon statements of a kind that harm the reputation of&para;<br>another or deter third parties from association or dealing&para;<br>with the victim.

ALVAREZ&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>intentional infliction of emotional distress (like torts involving placing a victim in a false light) concern falsehoods&para;<br>that tend to cause harm to a specific victim of an emotional-,&para;<br>dignitary-, or privacy-related kind. See id., §652E.&para;<br>Perjury statutes prohibit a particular set of false statements—those made under oath—while requiring a showing of materiality. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §1621. Statutes&para;<br>forbidding lying to a government official (not under oath)&para;<br>are typically limited to circumstances where a lie is likely&para;<br>to work particular and specific harm by interfering with&para;<br>the functioning of a government department, and those&para;<br>statutes also require a showing of materiality. See, e.g.,&para;<br>§1001.&para;<br>Statutes prohibiting false claims of terrorist attacks, or&para;<br>other lies about the commission of crimes or catastrophes,&para;<br>require proof that substantial public harm be directly&para;<br>foreseeable, or, if not, involve false statements that are&para;<br>very likely to bring about that harm. See, e.g., 47 CFR&para;<br>§73.1217 (2011) (requiring showing of foreseeability and&para;<br>actual substantial harm); 18 U. S. C. §1038(a)(1) (prohibiting knowing false statements claiming that terrorist attacks have taken, are taking, or will take, place).&para;<br>Statutes forbidding impersonation of a public official&para;<br>typically focus on acts of impersonation, not mere speech,&para;<br>and may require a showing that, for example, someone&para;<br>was deceived into following a “course [of action] he would&para;<br>not have pursued but for the deceitful conduct.” United&para;<br>States v.

Similarly, a false claim of possession of a medal&para;<br>or other honor creates confusion about who is entitled to&para;<br>wear it, thus diluting its value to those who have earned&para;<br>it, to their families, and to their country. But trademark&para;<br>statutes are focused upon commercial and promotional&para;<br>activities that are likely to dilute the value of a mark.&para;<br>Indeed, they typically require a showing of likely confusion, a showing that tends to assure that the feared harm&para;<br>will in fact take place. See 15 U. S. C. §1114(1)(a); KP&para;<br>Permanent Make-Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc.,&para;<br>543 U. S. 111, 117 (2004); see also San Francisco Arts &amp;&para;<br>Athletics, Inc. v.

Instead, in virtually all these instances limitations of context, requirements of proof of injury, and the&para;<br>like, narrow the statute to a subset of lies where specific&para;<br>harm is more likely to occur. The limitations help to make&para;<br>certain that the statute does not allow its threat of liability or criminal punishment to roam at large, discouraging&para;<br>or forbidding the telling of the lie in contexts where harm&para;<br>is unlikely or the need for the prohibition is small.&para;<br>The statute before us lacks any such limiting features.&para;<br>It may be construed to prohibit only knowing and intentional acts of deception about readily verifiable facts within the personal knowledge of the speaker, thus reducing&para;<br>the risk that valuable speech is chilled. Supra, at 3–4.&para;<br>But it still ranges very broadly. And that breadth means&para;<br>that it creates a significant risk of First Amendment&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>harm. As written, it applies in family, social, or other&para;<br>private contexts, where lies will often cause little harm. It&para;<br>also applies in political contexts, where although such lies&para;<br>are more likely to cause harm, the risk of censorious selectivity by prosecutors is also high. Further, given the&para;<br>potential haziness of individual memory along with the&para;<br>large number of military awards covered (ranging from&para;<br>medals for rifle marksmanship to the Congressional Medal&para;<br>of Honor), there remains a risk of chilling that is not completely eliminated by mens rea requirements; a speaker&para;<br>might still be worried about being prosecuted for a careless&para;<br>false statement, even if he does not have the intent required to render him liable. And so the prohibition may be&para;<br>applied where it should not be applied, for example, to bar&para;<br>stool braggadocio or, in the political arena, subtly but&para;<br>selectively to speakers that the Government does not like.&para;<br>These considerations lead me to believe that the statute as&para;<br>written risks significant First Amendment harm.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Like both the plurality and the dissent, I believe the&para;<br>statute nonetheless has substantial justification. It seeks&para;<br>to protect the interests of those who have sacrificed their&para;<br>health and life for their country. The statute serves this&para;<br>interest by seeking to preserve intact the country’s recognition of that sacrifice in the form of military honors. To&para;<br>permit those who have not earned those honors to claim&para;<br>otherwise dilutes the value of the awards. Indeed, the&para;<br>Nation cannot fully honor those who have sacrificed so&para;<br>much for their country’s honor unless those who claim to&para;<br>have received its military awards tell the truth. Thus, the&para;<br>statute risks harming protected interests but only in order&para;<br>to achieve a substantial countervailing objective.&para;<br>C&para;<br>We must therefore ask whether it is possible substan-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>tially to achieve the Government’s objective in less burdensome ways. In my view, the answer to this question is&para;<br>“yes.” Some potential First Amendment threats can be&para;<br>alleviated by interpreting the statute to require knowledge&para;<br>of falsity, etc. Supra, at 3–4. But other First Amendment&para;<br>risks, primarily risks flowing from breadth of coverage,&para;<br>remain. Supra, at 4–5, 7–8. As is indicated by the limitations on the scope of the many other kinds of statutes&para;<br>regulating false factual speech, supra, at 5–7, it should&para;<br>be possible significantly to diminish or eliminate these remaining risks by enacting a similar but more finely tailored statute. For example, not all military awards are&para;<br>alike. Congress might determine that some warrant&para;<br>greater protection than others. And a more finely tailored&para;<br>statute might, as other kinds of statutes prohibiting false&para;<br>factual statements have done, insist upon a showing that&para;<br>the false statement caused specific harm or at least was&para;<br>material, or focus its coverage on lies most likely to be&para;<br>harmful or on contexts where such lies are most likely to&para;<br>cause harm.&para;<br>I recognize that in some contexts, particularly political&para;<br>contexts, such a narrowing will not always be easy to&para;<br>achieve. In the political arena a false statement is more&para;<br>likely to make a behavioral difference (say, by leading the&para;<br>listeners to vote for the speaker) but at the same time&para;<br>criminal prosecution is particularly dangerous (say, by&para;<br>radically changing a potential election result) and consequently can more easily result in censorship of speakers&para;<br>and their ideas. Thus, the statute may have to be significantly narrowed in its applications. Some lower courts&para;<br>have upheld the constitutionality of roughly comparable&para;<br>but narrowly tailored statutes in political contexts. See,&para;<br>e.g., United We Stand America, Inc. v. United We Stand,&para;<br>America New York, Inc., 128 F. 3d 86, 93 (CA2 1997)&para;<br>(upholding against First Amendment challenge application of Lanham Act to a political organization); Treasure of&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

W. 2d 446 (1986) (upholding under&para;<br>First Amendment statute prohibiting campaign material&para;<br>falsely claiming that one is an incumbent). Without expressing any view on the validity of those cases, I would&para;<br>also note, like the plurality, that in this area more accurate information will normally counteract the lie. And an&para;<br>accurate, publicly available register of military awards,&para;<br>easily obtainable by political opponents, may well adequately protect the integrity of an award against those&para;<br>who would falsely claim to have earned it. See ante, at&para;<br>17–18. And so it is likely that a more narrowly tailored&para;<br>statute combined with such information-disseminating&para;<br>devices will effectively serve Congress’ end.&para;<br>The Government has provided no convincing explanation as to why a more finely tailored statute would not&para;<br>work. In my own view, such a statute could significantly&para;<br>reduce the threat of First Amendment harm while permitting the statute to achieve its important protective objective. That being so, I find the statute as presently drafted&para;<br>works disproportionate constitutional harm. It consequently fails intermediate scrutiny, and so violates the&para;<br>First Amendment.&para;<br>For these reasons, I concur in the Court’s judgment.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

When&para;<br>George Washington, as the commander of the Continental&para;<br>Army, created the very first “honorary badges of distinction” for service in our country’s military, he established&para;<br>a rigorous system to ensure that these awards would be&para;<br>received and worn by only the truly deserving. See General Orders of George Washington Issued at Newburgh&para;<br>on the Hudson, 1782–1783, p. 35 (E. Boynton ed. 1883)&para;<br>(reprint 1973) (requiring the submission of “incontestible proof ” of “singularly meritorious action” to the Commander in Chief). Washington warned that anyone with the&para;<br>“insolence to assume” a badge that had not actually been&para;<br>earned would be “severely punished.” Id., at 34.&para;<br>Building on this tradition, Congress long ago made it a&para;<br>federal offense for anyone to wear, manufacture, or sell&para;<br>certain military decorations without authorization.

Although this Court has&para;<br>never opined on the constitutionality of that particular&para;<br>provision, we have said that §702, which makes it a crime&para;<br>to wear a United States military uniform without authorization, is “a valid statute on its face.” Schacht v.

In much the same way, the&para;<br>proliferation of false claims about military awards blurs&para;<br>the signal given out by the actual awards by making them&para;<br>seem more common than they really are, and this diluting&para;<br>effect harms the military by hampering its efforts to foster&para;<br>morale and esprit de corps. Surely it was reasonable for&para;<br>Congress to conclude that the goal of preserving the integrity of our country’s top military honors is at least as&para;<br>worthy as that of protecting the prestige associated with&para;<br>fancy watches and designer handbags. Cf. San Francisco&para;<br>Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483&para;<br>U. S. 522, 539541 (1987) (rejecting First Amendment&para;<br>challenge to law prohibiting certain unauthorized uses of&para;<br>the word “Olympic” and recognizing that such uses harm&para;<br>the U. S. Olympic Committee by “lessening the distinctiveness” of the term).&para;<br>Both the plurality and JUSTICE BREYER argue that&para;<br>Congress could have preserved the integrity of military&para;<br>honors by means other than a criminal prohibition, but&para;<br>Congress had ample reason to believe that alternative&para;<br>approaches would not be adequate. The chief alternative&para;<br>that is recommended is the compilation and release of a&para;<br>comprehensive list or database of actual medal recipients.&para;<br>If the public could readily access such a resource, it is&para;<br>argued, imposters would be quickly and easily exposed,&para;<br>and the proliferation of lies about military honors would&para;<br>come to an end.&para;<br>This remedy, unfortunately, will not work. The Department of Defense has explained that the most that it&para;<br>can do is to create a database of recipients of certain top&para;<br>military honors awarded since 2001. See Office of Undersecretary of Defense, Report to the Senate and House&para;<br>Armed Services Committees on a Searchable Military&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Valor Decorations Database 45 (2009).13&para;<br>Because a sufficiently comprehensive database is not&para;<br>practicable, lies about military awards cannot be remedied&para;<br>by what the plurality calls “counterspeech.” Ante, at 15.&para;<br>Without the requisite database, many efforts to refute&para;<br>false claims may be thwarted, and some legitimate award&para;<br>recipients may be erroneously attacked. In addition, a&para;<br>steady stream of stories in the media about the exposure&para;<br>of imposters would tend to increase skepticism among&para;<br>members of the public about the entire awards system.&para;<br>This would only exacerbate the harm that the Stolen Valor&para;<br>Act is meant to prevent.&para;<br>The plurality and the concurrence also suggest that&para;<br>Congress could protect the system of military honors by&para;<br>enacting a narrower statute. The plurality recommends a&para;<br>law that would apply only to lies that are intended to&para;<br>“secure moneys or other valuable considerations.” Ante, at&para;<br>11. In a similar vein, the concurrence comments that “a&para;<br>more finely tailored statute might . . . insist upon a showing that the false statement caused specific harm.” Ante,&para;<br>at 9 (opinion of BREYER, J.). But much damage is caused,&para;<br>both to real award recipients and to the system of military honors, by false statements that are not linked to&para;<br>any financial or other tangible reward. Unless even a&para;<br>small financial loss—say, a dollar given to a homeless man&para;<br>falsely claiming to be a decorated veteran—is more important in the eyes of the First Amendment than the&para;<br>damage caused to the very integrity of the military awards&para;<br>system, there is no basis for distinguishing between the&para;<br>Stolen Valor Act and the alternative statutes that the&para;<br>plurality and concurrence appear willing to sustain.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 In&para;<br>&para;<br>addition, since the Department may not disclose the Social Security numbers or birthdates of recipients, this database would be of&para;<br>limited use in ascertaining the veracity of a claim involving a person&para;<br>with a common name.

ALVAREZ&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER also proposes narrowing the statute so&para;<br>that it covers a shorter list of military awards, ante, at 9&para;<br>(opinion concurring in judgment), but he does not provide&para;<br>a hint about where he thinks the line must be drawn.&para;<br>Perhaps he expects Congress to keep trying until it eventually passes a law that draws the line in just the right&para;<br>place.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Time and again, this Court has recognized that as a&para;<br>general matter false factual statements possess no intrinsic First Amendment value.

S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 6) (quoting&para;<br>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 571572&para;<br>(1942)). Laws prohibiting fraud, perjury, and defamation,&para;<br>for example, were in existence when the First Amendment&para;<br>was adopted, and their constitutionality is now beyond&para;<br>question. See, e.g., Donaldson v. Read Magazine, Inc., 333&para;<br>U. S. 178, 190 (1948) (explaining that the government’s&para;<br>power “to protect people against fraud” has “always been&para;<br>recognized in this country and is firmly established”);&para;<br>United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U. S. 87, 97 (1993) (observing that “the constitutionality of perjury statutes is&para;<br>unquestioned”); Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U. S. 250, 256&para;<br>(1952) (noting that the “prevention and punishment” of&para;<br>libel “have never been thought to raise any Constitutional&para;<br>problem”).&para;<br>We have also described as falling outside the First&para;<br>Amendment’s protective shield certain false factual statements that were neither illegal nor tortious at the time of&para;<br>the Amendment’s adoption. The right to freedom of&para;<br>speech has been held to permit recovery for the intentional&para;<br>infliction of emotional distress by means of a false state-&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ment, see Falwell, supra, at 56, even though that tort did&para;<br>not enter our law until the late 19th century, see W. Keeton,&para;<br>D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton&para;<br>on Law of Torts §12, p. 60, and n. 47. (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and Keeton). And in Hill, supra, at 390,&para;<br>the Court concluded that the free speech right allows&para;<br>recovery for the even more modern tort of false-light invasion of privacy, see Prosser and Keeton §117, at 863.&para;<br>In line with these holdings, it has long been assumed&para;<br>that the First Amendment is not offended by prominent&para;<br>criminal statutes with no close common-law analog. The&para;<br>most well known of these is probably 18 U. S. C. §1001,&para;<br>which makes it a crime to “knowingly and willfully” make&para;<br>any “materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or&para;<br>representation” in “any matter within the jurisdiction of&para;<br>the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States.” Unlike perjury, §1001&para;<br>is not limited to statements made under oath or before&para;<br>an official government tribunal. Nor does it require any&para;<br>showing of “pecuniary or property loss to the government.”&para;<br>United States v. Gilliland, 312 U. S. 86, 93 (1941). Instead, the statute is based on the need to protect “agencies&para;<br>from the perversion which might result from the deceptive&para;<br>practices described.” Ibid. (emphasis added).&para;<br>Still other statutes make it a crime to falsely represent&para;<br>that one is speaking on behalf of, or with the approval of,&para;<br>the Federal Government. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §912 (making it a crime to falsely impersonate a federal officer); §709&para;<br>(making it a crime to knowingly use, without authorization, the names of enumerated federal agencies, such as&para;<br>“Federal Bureau of Investigation,” in a manner reasonably&para;<br>calculated to convey the impression that a communication&para;<br>is approved or authorized by the agency). We have recognized that §912, like §1001, does not require a showing of&para;<br>pecuniary or property loss and that its purpose is to&para;<br>“ ‘maintain the general good repute and dignity’ ” of Gov-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

S.&para;<br>702, 704 (1943) (quoting United States v. Barnow, 239&para;<br>U. S. 74, 80 (1915)). All told, there are more than 100&para;<br>federal criminal statutes that punish false statements&para;<br>made in connection with areas of federal agency concern.&para;<br>See United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 505507, and&para;<br>nn. 810 (1997) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (citing “at least&para;<br>100 federal false statement statutes” in the United States&para;<br>Code).&para;<br>These examples amply demonstrate that false statements of fact merit no First Amendment protection in&para;<br>their own right.14 It is true, as JUSTICE BREYER notes,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>14 The&para;<br>&para;<br>plurality rejects this rule. Although we have made clear that&para;<br>“[u]ntruthful speech . . . has never been protected for its own sake,”&para;<br>Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.,&para;<br>425 U. S. 748, 771 (1976), the most the plurality is willing to concede is&para;<br>that “the falsity of speech bears upon whether it is protected,” ante, at&para;<br>9. This represents a dramatic—and entirely unjustified—departure&para;<br>from the sound approach taken in past cases.&para;<br>Respondent and his supporting amici attempt to limit this rule to&para;<br>certain subsets of false statements, see, e.g., Brief for Respondent 53&para;<br>(asserting that, at most, only falsity that is proved to cause specific&para;<br>harm is stripped of its First Amendment protection), but the examples&para;<br>described above belie that attempt. These examples show that the rule&para;<br>at least applies to (1) specific types of false statements that were&para;<br>neither illegal nor tortious in 1791 (the torts of intentional infliction of&para;<br>emotional distress and false-light invasion of privacy did not exist when&para;<br>the First Amendment was adopted); (2) false speech that does not cause&para;<br>pecuniary harm (the harm remedied by the torts of defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and false-light invasion of privacy&para;<br>is often nonpecuniary in nature, as is the harm inflicted by statements&para;<br>that are illegal under §§912 and 1001); (3) false speech that does not&para;<br>cause detrimental reliance (neither perjury laws nor many of the&para;<br>federal false statement statutes require that anyone actually rely on&para;<br>the false statement); (4) particular false statements that are not shown&para;<br>in court to have caused specific harm (damages can be presumed in&para;<br>defamation actions involving knowing or reckless falsehoods, and no&para;<br>showing of specific harm is required in prosecutions under many of the&para;<br>federal false statement statutes); and (5) false speech that does not&para;<br>cause harm to a specific individual (the purpose of many of the federal&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that many in our society either approve or condone certain&para;<br>discrete categories of false statements, including false&para;<br>statements made to prevent harm to innocent victims and&para;<br>so-called “white lies.” See ante, at 4. But respondent’s&para;<br>false claim to have received the Medal of Honor did not&para;<br>fall into any of these categories. His lie did not “prevent&para;<br>embarrassment, protect privacy, shield a person from&para;<br>prejudice, provide the sick with comfort, or preserve a&para;<br>child’s innocence.” Ibid. Nor did his lie “stop a panic or&para;<br>otherwise preserve calm in the face of danger” or further&para;<br>philosophical or scientific debate. Ibid. Respondent’s&para;<br>claim, like all those covered by the Stolen Valor Act,&para;<br>served no valid purpose.&para;<br>Respondent and others who join him in attacking the&para;<br>Stolen Valor Act take a different view. Respondent’s brief&para;<br>features a veritable paean to lying. According to respondent, his lie about the Medal of Honor was nothing out of&para;<br>the ordinary for 21st-century Americans. “Everyone lies,”&para;<br>he says. Brief for Respondent 10. “We lie all the time.”&para;<br>Ibid. “[H]uman beings are constantly forced to choose the&para;<br>persona we present to the world, and our choices nearly&para;<br>always involve intentional omissions and misrepresentations, if not outright deception.” Id., at 39. An academic&para;<br>amicus tells us that the First Amendment protects the&para;<br>right to construct “self-aggrandizing fabrications such as&para;<br>having been awarded a military decoration.” Brief for&para;<br>Jonathan D. Varat as Amicus Curiae 5.&para;<br>This radical interpretation of the First Amendment is&para;<br>not supported by any precedent of this Court. The lies&para;<br>covered by the Stolen Valor Act have no intrinsic value&para;<br>and thus merit no First Amendment protection unless&para;<br>their prohibition would chill other expression that falls&para;<br>within the Amendment’s scope. I now turn to that question.&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>false statement statutes is to protect government processes). &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>While we have repeatedly endorsed the principle that&para;<br>false statements of fact do not merit First Amendment&para;<br>protection for their own sake, we have recognized that it is&para;<br>sometimes necessary to “exten[d] a measure of strategic&para;<br>protection” to these statements in order to ensure sufficient “ ‘breathing space’ ” for protected speech. Gertz, 418&para;<br>U. S., at 342 (quoting NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 433&para;<br>(1963)). Thus, in order to prevent the chilling of truthful&para;<br>speech on matters of public concern, we have held that&para;<br>liability for the defamation of a public official or figure&para;<br>requires proof that defamatory statements were made&para;<br>with knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity. See&para;<br>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 279280&para;<br>(1964) (civil liability); Garrison, 379 U. S., at 7475 (criminal liability). This same requirement applies when public&para;<br>officials and figures seek to recover for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. See Falwell, 485&para;<br>U. S., at 5556. And we have imposed “[e]xacting proof&para;<br>requirements” in other contexts as well when necessary to&para;<br>ensure that truthful speech is not chilled. Madigan, 538&para;<br>U. S., at 620 (complainant in a fraud action must show&para;<br>that the defendant made a knowingly false statement of&para;<br>material fact with the intent to mislead the listener and&para;<br>that he succeeded in doing so); see also BE&amp;K Constr., 536&para;<br>U. S., at 531 (regulation of baseless lawsuits limited to&para;<br>those that are both “objectively baseless and subjectively&para;<br>motivated by an unlawful purpose”); Hartlage, 456 U. S.,&para;<br>at 61 (sustaining as-applied First Amendment challenge to&para;<br>law prohibiting certain “factual misstatements in the&para;<br>course of political debate” where there had been no showing that the disputed statement was made “other than in&para;<br>good faith and without knowledge of its falsity, or . . . with&para;<br>reckless disregard as to whether it was false or not”). All&para;<br>of these proof requirements inevitably have the effect of&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>bringing some false factual statements within the protection of the First Amendment, but this is justified in order&para;<br>to prevent the chilling of other, valuable speech.&para;<br>These examples by no means exhaust the circumstances&para;<br>in which false factual statements enjoy a degree of instrumental constitutional protection. On the contrary,&para;<br>there are broad areas in which any attempt by the state to&para;<br>penalize purportedly false speech would present a grave&para;<br>and unacceptable danger of suppressing truthful speech.&para;<br>Laws restricting false statements about philosophy, religion, history, the social sciences, the arts, and other matters of public concern would present such a threat. The&para;<br>point is not that there is no such thing as truth or falsity&para;<br>in these areas or that the truth is always impossible to&para;<br>ascertain, but rather that it is perilous to permit the state&para;<br>to be the arbiter of truth.&para;<br>Even where there is a wide scholarly consensus concerning a particular matter, the truth is served by allowing&para;<br>that consensus to be challenged without fear of reprisal.&para;<br>Today’s accepted wisdom sometimes turns out to be mistaken. And in these contexts, “[e]ven a false statement&para;<br>may be deemed to make a valuable contribution to public&para;<br>debate, since it brings about ‘the clearer perception and&para;<br>livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with&para;<br>error.’ ” Sullivan, supra, at 279, n. 19 (quoting J. Mill, On&para;<br>Liberty 15 (R. McCallum ed. 1947)).&para;<br>Allowing the state to proscribe false statements in these&para;<br>areas also opens the door for the state to use its power for&para;<br>political ends. Statements about history illustrate this&para;<br>point. If some false statements about historical events&para;<br>may be banned, how certain must it be that a statement is&para;<br>false before the ban may be upheld? And who should&para;<br>make that calculation? While our cases prohibiting viewpoint discrimination would fetter the state’s power to some&para;<br>degree, see R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 384390&para;<br>(1992) (explaining that the First Amendment does not&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>permit the government to engage in viewpoint discrimination under the guise of regulating unprotected speech), the&para;<br>potential for abuse of power in these areas is simply too&para;<br>great.&para;<br>In stark contrast to hypothetical laws prohibiting false&para;<br>statements about history, science, and similar matters,&para;<br>the Stolen Valor Act presents no risk at all that valuable&para;<br>speech will be suppressed. The speech punished by the&para;<br>Act is not only verifiably false and entirely lacking in&para;<br>intrinsic value, but it also fails to serve any instrumental purpose that the First Amendment might protect. Tellingly, when asked at oral argument what truthful speech&para;<br>the Stolen Valor Act might chill, even respondent’s counsel&para;<br>conceded that the answer is none. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Neither of the two opinions endorsed by Justices in the&para;<br>majority claims that the false statements covered by the&para;<br>Stolen Valor Act possess either intrinsic or instrumental&para;<br>value. Instead, those opinions appear to be based on the&para;<br>distinct concern that the Act suffers from overbreadth.&para;<br>See ante, at 10 (plurality opinion) (the Act applies to “personal, whispered conversations within a home”); ante, at 8&para;<br>(BREYER, J., concurring in judgment) (the Act “applies in&para;<br>family, social, or other private contexts” and in “political&para;<br>contexts”). But to strike down a statute on the basis that&para;<br>it is overbroad, it is necessary to show that the statute’s&para;<br>“overbreadth [is] substantial, not only in an absolute&para;<br>sense, but also relative to [its] plainly legitimate sweep.”&para;<br>United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 292 (2008); see&para;<br>also ibid. (noting that this requirement has been “vigorously enforced”). The plurality and the concurrence do not&para;<br>even attempt to make this showing.&para;<br>The plurality additionally worries that a decision sustaining the Stolen Valor Act might prompt Congress and&para;<br>the state legislatures to enact laws criminalizing lies&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>about “an endless list of subjects.” Ante, at 11. The plurality apparently fears that we will see laws making it a&para;<br>crime to lie about civilian awards such as college degrees&para;<br>or certificates of achievement in the arts and sports.&para;<br>This concern is likely unfounded. With very good reason, military honors have traditionally been regarded as&para;<br>quite different from civilian awards. Nearly a century ago,&para;<br>Congress made it a crime to wear a military medal without authorization; we have no comparable tradition regarding such things as Super Bowl rings, Oscars, or Phi&para;<br>Beta Kappa keys.&para;<br>In any event, if the plurality’s concern is not entirely&para;<br>fanciful, it falls outside the purview of the First Amendment. The problem that the plurality foresees—that&para;<br>legislative bodies will enact unnecessary and overly intrusive criminal laws—applies regardless of whether the laws&para;<br>in question involve speech or nonexpressive conduct. If&para;<br>there is a problem with, let us say, a law making it a&para;<br>criminal offense to falsely claim to have been a high school&para;<br>valedictorian, the problem is not the suppression of speech&para;<br>but the misuse of the criminal law, which should be reserved for conduct that inflicts or threatens truly serious&para;<br>societal harm. The objection to this hypothetical law&para;<br>would be the same as the objection to a law making it a&para;<br>crime to eat potato chips during the graduation ceremony&para;<br>at which the high school valedictorian is recognized. The&para;<br>safeguard against such laws is democracy, not the First&para;<br>Amendment. Not every foolish law is unconstitutional.&para;<br>The Stolen Valor Act represents the judgment of the&para;<br>people’s elected representatives that false statements&para;<br>about military awards are very different from false statements about civilian awards. Certainly this is true with&para;<br>respect to the high honor that respondent misappropriated. Respondent claimed that he was awarded the Medal of&para;<br>Honor in 1987 for bravery during the Iran hostage crisis.&para;<br>This singular award, however, is bestowed only on those&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.
