Counsel for respondent Oneida Indian Nation&para;<br>advised the Court through a letter on November 30, 2010,&para;<br>that the Nation had, on November 29, 2010, passed a&para;<br>tribal declaration and ordinance waiving “its sovereign&para;<br>immunity to enforcement of real property taxation&para;<br>through foreclosure by state, county and local govern&para;<br>ments within and throughout the United States.” Oneida&para;<br>Indian Nation, Ordinance No. O-10–1 (2010). Petitioners&para;<br>Madison and Oneida Counties responded in a December 1,&para;<br>2010 letter, questioning the validity, scope, and perma&para;<br>nence of that waiver; the Nation addressed those concerns&para;<br>in a December 2, 2010 letter.&para;<br>We vacate the judgment and remand the case to the&para;<br>United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.&para;<br>That court should address, in the first instance, whether&para;<br>to revisit its ruling on sovereign immunity in light of this&para;<br>new factual development, and—if necessary—proceed to&para;<br>address other questions in the case consistent with its&para;<br>sovereign immunity ruling.
