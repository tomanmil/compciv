In Basic Inc. v. Levinson,&para;<br>485 U. S. 224, this Court held that investors could satisfy this reliance requirement by invoking a presumption that the price of stock&para;<br>traded in an efficient market reflects all public, material information—including material misrepresentations. The Court also held,&para;<br>however, that a defendant could rebut this presumption by showing&para;<br>that the alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock&para;<br>price—that is, that it had no “price impact.”&para;<br>Respondent Erica P. John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), filed a putative&para;<br>class action against Halliburton and one of its executives (collectively&para;<br>Halliburton), alleging that they made misrepresentations designed to&para;<br>inflate Halliburton’s stock price, in violation of section 10(b) of the&para;<br>Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b–5. The District Court initially denied EPJ Fund’s&para;<br>class certification motion, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed. But this&para;<br>Court vacated that judgment, concluding that securities fraud plaintiffs need not prove loss causation—a causal connection between the&para;<br>defendants’ alleged misrepresentations and the plaintiffs’ economic&para;<br>losses—at the class certification stage in order to invoke Basic’s presumption of reliance. On remand, Halliburton argued that class certification was nonetheless inappropriate because the evidence it had&para;<br>earlier introduced to disprove loss causation also showed that its alleged misrepresentations had not affected its stock price. By demonstrating the absence of any “price impact,” Halliburton contended, it&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>had rebutted the Basic presumption. And without the benefit of that&para;<br>presumption, investors would have to prove reliance on an individual&para;<br>basis, meaning that individual issues would predominate over common ones and class certification would be inappropriate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). The District Court rejected Halliburton’s argument and certified the class. The Fifth Circuit&para;<br>affirmed, concluding that Halliburton could use its price impact evidence to rebut the Basic presumption only at trial, not at the class&para;<br>certification stage.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Halliburton has not shown a “special justification,” Dickerson v.&para;<br>United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443, for overruling Basic’s presumption&para;<br>of reliance. Pp. 4–16.&para;<br>(a) To recover damages under section 10(b) and Rule 10b–5, a&para;<br>plaintiff must prove, as relevant here, “ ‘reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission.’ ” Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans&para;<br>and Trust Funds, 568 U. S. ___, ___. The Court recognized in Basic,&para;<br>however, that requiring direct proof of reliance from every individual&para;<br>plaintiff “would place an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on the . . . plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market,”&para;<br>485 U. S., at 245, and “effectively would” prevent plaintiffs “from proceeding with a class action” in Rule 10b–5 suits, id., at 242. To address these concerns, the Court held that plaintiffs could satisfy the&para;<br>reliance element of a Rule 10b–5 action by invoking a rebuttable presumption of reliance. The Court based that presumption on what is&para;<br>known as the “fraud-on-the-market” theory, which holds that “the&para;<br>market price of shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all&para;<br>publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.” Id., at 246. The Court also noted that the typical “investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in&para;<br>reliance on the integrity of that price.” Id., at 247. As a result,&para;<br>whenever an investor buys or sells stock at the market price, his “reliance on any public material misrepresentations . . . may be presumed for purposes of a Rule 10b–5 action.” Id. at 247. Basic also&para;<br>emphasized that the presumption of reliance was rebuttable rather&para;<br>than conclusive. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>(b) None of Halliburton’s arguments for overruling Basic so discredit the decision as to constitute a “special justification.” Pp. 7–12.&para;<br>(1) Halliburton first argues that the Basic presumption is inconsistent with Congress’s intent in passing the 1934 Exchange Act—&para;<br>the same argument made by the dissenting Justices in Basic. The&para;<br>Basic majority did not find that argument persuasive then, and Halliburton has given no new reason to endorse it now. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(2) Halliburton also contends that Basic rested on two premis-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>es that have been undermined by developments in economic theory.&para;<br>First, it argues that the Basic Court espoused “a robust view of market efficiency” that is no longer tenable in light of empirical evidence&para;<br>ostensibly showing that material, public information often is not&para;<br>quickly incorporated into stock prices. The Court in Basic acknowledged, however, the debate among economists about the efficiency of&para;<br>capital markets and refused to endorse “any particular theory of how&para;<br>quickly and completely publicly available information is reflected in&para;<br>market price.” 485 U. S., at 248, n. 28. The Court instead based the&para;<br>presumption of reliance on the fairly modest premise that “market&para;<br>professionals generally consider most publicly announced material&para;<br>statements about companies, thereby affecting stock market prices.”&para;<br>Id., at 247, n. 24. Moreover, in making the presumption rebuttable,&para;<br>Basic recognized that market efficiency is a matter of degree and accordingly made it a matter of proof. Halliburton has not identified&para;<br>the kind of fundamental shift in economic theory that could justify&para;<br>overruling a precedent on the ground that it misunderstood, or has&para;<br>since been overtaken by, economic realities.&para;<br>Halliburton also contests the premise that investors “invest ‘in reliance on the integrity of [the market] price,’ ” id., at 247, identifying&para;<br>a number of classes of investors for whom “price integrity” is supposedly “marginal or irrelevant.” But Basic never denied the existence&para;<br>of such investors, who in any event rely at least on the facts that&para;<br>market prices will incorporate public information within a reasonable&para;<br>period and that market prices, however inaccurate, are not distorted&para;<br>by fraud. Pp. 8–12.&para;<br>(c) The principle of stare decisis has “ ‘special force’ ” “in respect&para;<br>to statutory interpretation” because “ ‘Congress remains free to alter&para;<br>what [the Court has] done.’ ” John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United&para;<br>States, 552 U. S. 130, 139. So too with Basic’s presumption of reliance. The presumption is not inconsistent with this Court’s more recent decisions construing the Rule 10b–5 cause of action. In Central&para;<br>Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511&para;<br>U. S. 164, and Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. ScientificAtlanta, Inc., 552 U. S. 148, the Court declined to effectively eliminate the reliance element by extending liability to entirely new categories of defendants who themselves had not made any material,&para;<br>public misrepresentation. The Basic presumption, by contrast, merely provides an alternative means of satisfying the reliance element.&para;<br>Nor is the Basic presumption inconsistent with the Court’s recent decisions governing class action certification, which require plaintiffs to&para;<br>prove—not simply plead—that their proposed class satisfies each requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, including, if applicable, the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). See, e.g., Wal-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___. The Basic presumption&para;<br>does not relieve plaintiffs of that burden but rather sets forth what&para;<br>plaintiffs must prove to demonstrate predominance. Finally, Halliburton emphasizes the possible harmful consequences of the securities class actions facilitated by the Basic presumption, but such concerns are more appropriately addressed to Congress, which has in&para;<br>fact responded, to some extent, to many of them. Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>2. For the same reasons the Court declines to overrule Basic’s presumption of reliance, it also declines to modify the prerequisites for&para;<br>invoking the presumption by requiring plaintiffs to prove “price impact” directly at the class certification stage. The Basic presumption&para;<br>incorporates two constituent presumptions: First, if a plaintiff shows&para;<br>that the defendant’s misrepresentation was public and material and&para;<br>that the stock traded in a generally efficient market, he is entitled to&para;<br>a presumption that the misrepresentation affected the stock price.&para;<br>Second, if the plaintiff also shows that he purchased the stock at the&para;<br>market price during the relevant period, he is entitled to a further&para;<br>presumption that he purchased the stock in reliance on the defendant’s misrepresentation. Requiring plaintiffs to prove price impact&para;<br>directly would take away the first constituent presumption. Halliburton’s argument for doing so is the same as its argument for overruling the Basic presumption altogether, and it meets the same fate.&para;<br>Pp. 16–18.&para;<br>3. The Court agrees with Halliburton, however, that defendants&para;<br>must be afforded an opportunity to rebut the presumption of reliance&para;<br>before class certification with evidence of a lack of price impact. Defendants may already introduce such evidence at the merits stage to&para;<br>rebut the Basic presumption, as well as at the class certification&para;<br>stage to counter a plaintiff’s showing of market efficiency. Forbidding defendants to rely on the same evidence prior to class certification for the particular purpose of rebutting the presumption altogether makes no sense, and can readily lead to results that are&para;<br>inconsistent with Basic’s own logic. Basic allows plaintiffs to establish price impact indirectly, by showing that a stock traded in an efficient market and that a defendant’s misrepresentations were public&para;<br>and material. But an indirect proxy should not preclude consideration of a defendant’s direct, more salient evidence showing that an alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect the stock’s price and,&para;<br>consequently, that the Basic presumption does not apply. Amgen&para;<br>does not require a different result. There, the Court held that materiality, though a prerequisite for invoking the Basic presumption,&para;<br>should be left to the merits stage because it does not bear on the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). In contrast, the fact that a&para;<br>misrepresentation has price impact is “Basic’s fundamental premise.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U. S. ___, ___. It&para;<br>thus has everything to do with the issue of predominance at the class&para;<br>certification stage. That is why, if reliance is to be shown through&para;<br>the Basic presumption, the publicity and market efficiency prerequisites must be proved before class certification. Given that such indirect evidence of price impact will be before the court at the class certification stage in any event, there is no reason to artificially limit the&para;<br>inquiry at that stage by excluding direct evidence of price impact.&para;<br>Pp. 18–23.&para;<br>718 F. 3d 423, vacated and remanded.&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

In Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.

John Fund, Inc. (EPJ Fund), is the&para;<br>lead plaintiff in a putative class action against Halliburton&para;<br>and one of its executives (collectively Halliburton) alleging&para;<br>violations of section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act&para;<br>of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, 15 U. S. C. §78j(b), and Securities&para;<br>and Exchange Commission Rule 10b–5, 17 CFR §240.10b–5&para;<br>(2013). According to EPJ Fund, between June 3, 1999,&para;<br>and December 7, 2001, Halliburton made a series of misrepresentations regarding its potential liability in asbestos&para;<br>litigation, its expected revenue from certain construction&para;<br>contracts, and the anticipated benefits of its merger with&para;<br>another company—all in an attempt to inflate the price of&para;<br>its stock. Halliburton subsequently made a number of&para;<br>corrective disclosures, which, EPJ Fund contends, caused&para;<br>the company’s stock price to drop and investors to lose&para;<br>money.&para;<br>EPJ Fund moved to certify a class comprising all investors who purchased Halliburton common stock during the&para;<br>class period. The District Court found that the proposed&para;<br>class satisfied all the threshold requirements of Federal&para;<br>Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a): It was sufficiently numerous, there were common questions of law or fact, the representative parties’ claims were typical of the class claims,&para;<br>and the representatives could fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a.&para;<br>And except for one difficulty, the court would have also&para;<br>concluded that the class satisfied the requirement of Rule&para;<br>23(b)(3) that “the questions of law or fact common to class&para;<br>members predominate over any questions affecting only&para;<br>individual members.” See id., at 55a, 98a. The difficulty&para;<br>was that Circuit precedent required securities fraud plain-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Because EPJ Fund&para;<br>had not demonstrated such a connection for any of Halliburton’s alleged misrepresentations, the District Court&para;<br>refused to certify the proposed class. Id., at 55a, 98a. The&para;<br>United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the denial of class certification on the same ground.&para;<br>Archdiocese of Milwaukee Supporting Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 597 F. 3d 330 (2010).&para;<br>We granted certiorari and vacated the judgment, finding&para;<br>nothing in “Basic or its logic” to justify the Fifth Circuit’s&para;<br>requirement that securities fraud plaintiffs prove loss&para;<br>causation at the class certification stage in order to invoke&para;<br>Basic’s presumption of reliance. Erica P. John Fund, Inc.&para;<br>v. Halliburton Co., 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (Halliburton&para;<br>I ) (slip op., at 6). “Loss causation,” we explained, “addresses a matter different from whether an investor relied&para;<br>on a misrepresentation, presumptively or otherwise, when&para;<br>buying or selling a stock.” Ibid. We remanded the case for&para;<br>the lower courts to consider “any further arguments&para;<br>against class certification” that Halliburton had preserved.&para;<br>Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).&para;<br>On remand, Halliburton argued that class certification&para;<br>was inappropriate because the evidence it had earlier&para;<br>introduced to disprove loss causation also showed that&para;<br>none of its alleged misrepresentations had actually affected its stock price.

Id., at 435–436. While&para;<br>acknowledging that “Halliburton’s price impact evidence&para;<br>could be used at the trial on the merits to refute the presumption of reliance,” id., at 433, the court held that&para;<br>Halliburton could not use such evidence for that purpose&para;<br>at the class certification stage, id., at 435. “[P]rice impact&para;<br>evidence,” the court explained, “does not bear on the question of common question predominance [under Rule&para;<br>23(b)(3)], and is thus appropriately considered only on the&para;<br>merits after the class has been certified.” Ibid.&para;<br>We once again granted certiorari, 571 U.

Before overturning a long-settled precedent, however, we require “special justification,” not just an argument that the precedent was wrongly decided. Dickerson&para;<br>v. United States, 530 U.

See Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor&para;<br>Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, 730 (1975). To recover damages&para;<br>for violations of section 10(b) and Rule 10b–5, a plaintiff&para;<br>must prove “ ‘(1) a material misrepresentation or omission&para;<br>by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the&para;<br>misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of&para;<br>a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or&para;<br>omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.’ ”&para;<br>Amgen Inc. v.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quoting Halliburton I, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4)). “The&para;<br>traditional (and most direct) way a plaintiff can demonstrate reliance is by showing that he was aware of a company’s statement and engaged in a relevant transaction—&para;<br>e.g., purchasing common stock—based on that specific&para;<br>misrepresentation.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).&para;<br>In Basic, however, we recognized that requiring such&para;<br>direct proof of reliance “would place an unnecessarily&para;<br>unrealistic evidentiary burden on the Rule 10b–5 plaintiff&para;<br>who has traded on an impersonal market.” 485 U. S., at&para;<br>245. That is because, even assuming an investor could&para;<br>prove that he was aware of the misrepresentation, he&para;<br>would still have to “show a speculative state of facts, i.e.,&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>how he would have acted . . . if the misrepresentation had&para;<br>not been made.” Ibid.&para;<br>We also noted that “[r]equiring proof of individualized&para;<br>reliance” from every securities fraud plaintiff “effectively&para;<br>would . . . prevent[ ] [plaintiffs] from proceeding with a&para;<br>class action” in Rule 10b–5 suits. Id., at 242. If every&para;<br>plaintiff had to prove direct reliance on the defendant’s&para;<br>misrepresentation, “individual issues then would . . .&para;<br>overwhelm[ ] the common ones,” making certification&para;<br>under Rule 23(b)(3) inappropriate. Ibid.&para;<br>To address these concerns, Basic held that securities&para;<br>fraud plaintiffs can in certain circumstances satisfy the&para;<br>reliance element of a Rule 10b–5 action by invoking a&para;<br>rebuttable presumption of reliance, rather than proving&para;<br>direct reliance on a misrepresentation. The Court based&para;<br>that presumption on what is known as the “fraud-on-themarket” theory, which holds that “the market price of&para;<br>shares traded on well-developed markets reflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations.” Id., at 246. The Court also noted that,&para;<br>rather than scrutinize every piece of public information&para;<br>about a company for himself, the typical “investor who&para;<br>buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in&para;<br>reliance on the integrity of that price”—the belief that it&para;<br>reflects all public, material information. Id., at 247. As a&para;<br>result, whenever the investor buys or sells stock at the&para;<br>market price, his “reliance on any public material misrepresentations . . . may be presumed for purposes of a Rule&para;<br>10b–5 action.” Ibid.&para;<br>Based on this theory, a plaintiff must make the following showings to demonstrate that the presumption of&para;<br>reliance applies in a given case: (1) that the alleged misrepresentations were publicly known, (2) that they were&para;<br>material, (3) that the stock traded in an efficient market,&para;<br>and (4) that the plaintiff traded the stock between the&para;<br>time the misrepresentations were made and when the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>truth was revealed. See id., at 248, n. 27; Halliburton I,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5–6).&para;<br>At the same time, Basic emphasized that the presumption of reliance was rebuttable rather than conclusive.&para;<br>Specifically, “[a]ny showing that severs the link between&para;<br>the alleged misrepresentation and either the price received (or paid) by the plaintiff, or his decision to trade at&para;<br>a fair market price, will be sufficient to rebut the presumption of reliance.” 485 U. S., at 248. So for example, if&para;<br>a defendant could show that the alleged misrepresentation&para;<br>did not, for whatever reason, actually affect the market&para;<br>price, or that a plaintiff would have bought or sold the&para;<br>stock even had he been aware that the stock’s price was&para;<br>tainted by fraud, then the presumption of reliance would&para;<br>not apply. Id., at 248–249. In either of those cases, a&para;<br>plaintiff would have to prove that he directly relied on the&para;<br>defendant’s misrepresentation in buying or selling the&para;<br>stock.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Halliburton contends that securities fraud plaintiffs&para;<br>should always have to prove direct reliance and that the&para;<br>Basic Court erred in allowing them to invoke a presumption of reliance instead. According to Halliburton, the&para;<br>Basic presumption contravenes congressional intent and&para;<br>has been undermined by subsequent developments in&para;<br>economic theory. Neither argument, however, so discredits Basic as to constitute “special justification” for overruling the decision.&para;<br>1&para;<br>Halliburton first argues that the Basic presumption is&para;<br>inconsistent with Congress’s intent in passing the 1934&para;<br>Exchange Act.

According to Halliburton, the closest analogue&para;<br>to section 10(b) is section 18(a) of the Act, which creates an express private cause of action allowing investors to recover damages based on misrepresentations&para;<br>made in certain regulatory filings. 15 U.

S. C. §78i—a provision that does not require actual reliance.&para;<br>We need not settle this dispute. In Basic, the dissenting&para;<br>Justices made the same argument based on section 18(a)&para;<br>that Halliburton presses here. See 485 U.

The&para;<br>Basic majority did not find that argument persuasive&para;<br>then, and Halliburton has given us no new reason to&para;<br>endorse it now.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Halliburton’s primary argument for overruling Basic is&para;<br>that the decision rested on two premises that can no longer&para;<br>withstand scrutiny. The first premise concerns what is&para;<br>known as the “efficient capital markets hypothesis.” Basic&para;<br>stated that “the market price of shares traded on well-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

From that statement, Halliburton concludes&para;<br>that the Basic Court espoused “a robust view of market&para;<br>efficiency” that is no longer tenable, for “ ‘overwhelming&para;<br>empirical evidence’ now ‘suggests that capital markets are&para;<br>not fundamentally efficient.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 14–16&para;<br>(quoting Lev &amp; de Villiers, Stock Price Crashes and 10b–5&para;<br>Damages: A Legal, Economic, and Policy Analysis, 47&para;<br>Stan. L. Rev 7, 20 (1994)). To support this contention,&para;<br>Halliburton cites studies purporting to show that “public&para;<br>information is often not incorporated immediately (much&para;<br>less rationally) into market prices.” Brief for Petitioners&para;<br>17; see id., at 16–20. See also Brief for Law Professors as&para;<br>Amici Curiae 15–18.&para;<br>Halliburton does not, of course, maintain that capital&para;<br>markets are always inefficient. Rather, in its view, Basic’s&para;<br>fundamental error was to ignore the fact that “ ‘efficiency&para;<br>is not a binary, yes or no question.’ ” Brief for Petitioners&para;<br>20 (quoting Langevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking&para;<br>Fraud on the Market, 2009 Wis. L. Rev. 151, 167)). The&para;<br>markets for some securities are more efficient than the&para;<br>markets for others, and even a single market can process&para;<br>different kinds of information more or less efficiently,&para;<br>depending on how widely the information is disseminated&para;<br>and how easily it is understood. Brief for Petitioners at&para;<br>20–21. Yet Basic, Halliburton asserts, glossed over these&para;<br>nuances, assuming a false dichotomy that renders the&para;<br>presumption of reliance both underinclusive and overinclusive: A misrepresentation can distort a stock’s market&para;<br>price even in a generally inefficient market, and a misrepresentation can leave a stock’s market price unaffected&para;<br>even in a generally efficient one. Brief for Petitioners at&para;<br>21.&para;<br>Halliburton’s criticisms fail to take Basic on its own&para;<br>terms. Halliburton focuses on the debate among econo-&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>mists about the degree to which the market price of a&para;<br>company’s stock reflects public information about the&para;<br>company—and thus the degree to which an investor can&para;<br>earn an abnormal, above-market return by trading on&para;<br>such information. See Brief for Financial Economists as&para;<br>Amici Curiae 4–10 (describing the debate). That debate is&para;<br>not new. Indeed, the Basic Court acknowledged it and&para;<br>declined to enter the fray, declaring that “[w]e need not&para;<br>determine by adjudication what economists and social&para;<br>scientists have debated through the use of sophisticated&para;<br>statistical analysis and the application of economic theory.” 485 U. S., at 246–247, n. 24. To recognize the presumption of reliance, the Court explained, was not “conclusively to adopt any particular theory of how quickly and&para;<br>completely publicly available information is reflected in&para;<br>market price.” Id., at 248, n. 28. The Court instead based&para;<br>the presumption on the fairly modest premise that “market professionals generally consider most publicly announced material statements about companies, thereby&para;<br>affecting stock market prices.” Id., at 247, n. 24. Basic’s&para;<br>presumption of reliance thus does not rest on a “binary”&para;<br>view of market efficiency. Indeed, in making the presumption rebuttable, Basic recognized that market efficiency is a matter of degree and accordingly made it a&para;<br>matter of proof.&para;<br>The academic debates discussed by Halliburton have not&para;<br>refuted the modest premise underlying the presumption of&para;<br>reliance. Even the foremost critics of the efficient-capitalmarkets hypothesis acknowledge that public information&para;<br>generally affects stock prices. See, e.g., Shiller, We’ll&para;<br>Share the Honors, and Agree to Disagree, N. Y. Times,&para;<br>Oct. 27, 2013, p. BU6 (“Of course, prices reflect available&para;<br>information”). Halliburton also conceded as much in its&para;<br>reply brief and at oral argument. See Reply Brief 13&para;<br>(“market prices generally respond to new, material information”); Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. Debates about the precise&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>degree to which stock prices accurately reflect public information are thus largely beside the point. “That the . . .&para;<br>price [of a stock] may be inaccurate does not detract from&para;<br>the fact that false statements affect it, and cause loss,”&para;<br>which is “all that Basic requires.” Schleicher v. Wendt,&para;<br>618 F. 3d 679, 685 (CA7 2010) (Easterbrook, C. J.). Even&para;<br>though the efficient capital markets hypothesis may have&para;<br>“garnered substantial criticism since Basic,” post, at 6&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment), Halliburton has not&para;<br>identified the kind of fundamental shift in economic theory that could justify overruling a precedent on the ground&para;<br>that it misunderstood, or has since been overtaken by,&para;<br>economic realities. Contrast State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522&para;<br>U. S. 3 (1997), unanimously overruling Albrecht v. Herald&para;<br>Co., 390 U. S. 145 (1968).&para;<br>Halliburton also contests a second premise underlying&para;<br>the Basic presumption: the notion that investors “invest&para;<br>‘in reliance on the integrity of [the market] price.’ ” Reply&para;<br>Brief 14 (quoting 485 U. S., at 247; alteration in original).&para;<br>Halliburton identifies a number of classes of investors for&para;<br>whom “price integrity” is supposedly “marginal or irrelevant.” Reply Brief 14. The primary example is the value&para;<br>investor, who believes that certain stocks are undervalued&para;<br>or overvalued and attempts to “beat the market” by buying&para;<br>the undervalued stocks and selling the overvalued ones.&para;<br>Brief for Petitioners 15–16 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). See also Brief for Vivendi S. A. as Amicus Curiae&para;<br>3–10 (describing the investment strategies of day traders, volatility arbitragers, and value investors). If many&para;<br>investors “are indifferent to prices,” Halliburton contends,&para;<br>then courts should not presume that investors rely on the&para;<br>integrity of those prices and any misrepresentations incorporated into them. Reply Brief 14.&para;<br>But Basic never denied the existence of such investors.&para;<br>As we recently explained, Basic concluded only that “it is&para;<br>reasonable to presume that most investors—knowing that&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>they have little hope of outperforming the market in the&para;<br>long run based solely on their analysis of publicly available information—will rely on the security’s market price as&para;<br>an unbiased assessment of the security’s value in light of&para;<br>all public information.” Amgen, 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 5) (emphasis added).&para;<br>In any event, there is no reason to suppose that even&para;<br>Halliburton’s main counterexample—the value investor—&para;<br>is as indifferent to the integrity of market prices as Halliburton suggests. Such an investor implicitly relies on the&para;<br>fact that a stock’s market price will eventually reflect&para;<br>material information—how else could the market correction on which his profit depends occur? To be sure, the&para;<br>value investor “does not believe that the market price&para;<br>accurately reflects public information at the time he transacts.” Post, at 11. But to indirectly rely on a misstatement in the sense relevant for the Basic presumption, he&para;<br>need only trade stock based on the belief that the market&para;<br>price will incorporate public information within a reasonable period. The value investor also presumably tries to&para;<br>estimate how undervalued or overvalued a particular&para;<br>stock is, and such estimates can be skewed by a market&para;<br>price tainted by fraud.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The principle of stare decisis has “ ‘special force’ ” “in&para;<br>respect to statutory interpretation” because “ ‘Congress&para;<br>remains free to alter what we have done.’ ” John R. Sand&para;<br>&amp; Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 139 (2008)&para;<br>(quoting Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164,&para;<br>172–173 (1989)). So too with Basic’s presumption of reliance. Although the presumption is a judicially created&para;<br>doctrine designed to implement a judicially created cause&para;<br>of action, we have described the presumption as “a substantive doctrine of federal securities-fraud law.” Amgen,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5). That is because it provides a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>way of satisfying the reliance element of the Rule 10b–5&para;<br>cause of action. See, e.g., Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v.&para;<br>Broudo, 544 U. S. 336, 341–342 (2005). As with any other&para;<br>element of that cause of action, Congress may overturn&para;<br>or modify any aspect of our interpretations of the reliance requirement, including the Basic presumption itself. Given that possibility, we see no reason to exempt&para;<br>the Basic presumption from ordinary principles of stare&para;<br>decisis.&para;<br>To buttress its case for overruling Basic, Halliburton&para;<br>contends that, in addition to being wrongly decided, the&para;<br>decision is inconsistent with our more recent decisions&para;<br>construing the Rule 10b–5 cause of action. As Halliburton&para;<br>notes, we have held that “we must give ‘narrow dimensions . . . to a right of action Congress did not authorize&para;<br>when it first enacted the statute and did not expand when&para;<br>it revisited the law.’ ” Janus Capital Group, Inc. v. First&para;<br>Derivative Traders, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6)&para;<br>(quoting Stoneridge, 552 U. S., at 167); see, e.g., Central&para;<br>Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver,&para;<br>N. A., 511 U. S. 164 (1994) (refusing to recognize aidingand-abetting liability under the Rule 10b–5 cause of action); Stoneridge, supra (refusing to extend Rule 10b–5&para;<br>liability to certain secondary actors who did not themselves make material misstatements). Yet the Basic&para;<br>presumption, Halliburton asserts, does just the opposite,&para;<br>expanding the Rule 10b–5 cause of action. Brief for Petitioners 27–29.&para;<br>Not so. In Central Bank and Stoneridge, we declined to&para;<br>extend Rule 10b–5 liability to entirely new categories of&para;<br>defendants who themselves had not made any material,&para;<br>public misrepresentation. Such an extension, we explained, would have eviscerated the requirement that a&para;<br>plaintiff prove that he relied on a misrepresentation made&para;<br>by the defendant. See Central Bank, supra, at 180; Stoneridge, supra, at 157, 159. The Basic presumption does&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>not eliminate that requirement but rather provides an&para;<br>alternative means of satisfying it. While the presumption&para;<br>makes it easier for plaintiffs to prove reliance, it does not&para;<br>alter the elements of the Rule 10b–5 cause of action and&para;<br>thus maintains the action’s original legal scope.&para;<br>Halliburton also argues that the Basic presumption&para;<br>cannot be reconciled with our recent decisions governing&para;<br>class action certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. Those decisions have made clear that plaintiffs&para;<br>wishing to proceed through a class action must actually&para;<br>prove—not simply plead—that their proposed class satisfies each requirement of Rule 23, including (if applicable)&para;<br>the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). See WalMart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip&para;<br>op., at 10); Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2013) (slip op., at 5–6). According to Halliburton, Basic&para;<br>relieves Rule 10b–5 plaintiffs of that burden, allowing&para;<br>courts to presume that common issues of reliance predominate over individual ones.&para;<br>That is not the effect of the Basic presumption. In&para;<br>securities class action cases, the crucial requirement for&para;<br>class certification will usually be the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). The Basic presumption does&para;<br>not relieve plaintiffs of the burden of proving—before class&para;<br>certification—that this requirement is met. Basic instead&para;<br>establishes that a plaintiff satisfies that burden by proving the prerequisites for invoking the presumption—&para;<br>namely, publicity, materiality, market efficiency, and&para;<br>market timing. The burden of proving those prerequisites&para;<br>still rests with plaintiffs and (with the exception of materiality) must be satisfied before class certification. Basic&para;<br>does not, in other words, allow plaintiffs simply to plead&para;<br>that common questions of reliance predominate over individual ones, but rather sets forth what they must prove to&para;<br>demonstrate such predominance.&para;<br>Basic does afford defendants an opportunity to rebut the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>presumption of reliance with respect to an individual&para;<br>plaintiff by showing that he did not rely on the integrity of&para;<br>the market price in trading stock. While this has the&para;<br>effect of “leav[ing] individualized questions of reliance in&para;<br>the case,” post, at 12, there is no reason to think that these&para;<br>questions will overwhelm common ones and render class&para;<br>certification inappropriate under Rule 23(b)(3). That the&para;<br>defendant might attempt to pick off the occasional class&para;<br>member here or there through individualized rebuttal&para;<br>does not cause individual questions to predominate.&para;<br>Finally, Halliburton and its amici contend that, by&para;<br>facilitating securities class actions, the Basic presumption&para;<br>produces a number of serious and harmful consequences.&para;<br>Such class actions, they say, allow plaintiffs to extort large&para;<br>settlements from defendants for meritless claims; punish&para;<br>innocent shareholders, who end up having to pay settlements and judgments; impose excessive costs on businesses;&para;<br>and consume a disproportionately large share of judicial&para;<br>resources. Brief for Petitioners 39–45.&para;<br>These concerns are more appropriately addressed to&para;<br>Congress, which has in fact responded, to some extent, to&para;<br>many of the issues raised by Halliburton and its amici.&para;<br>Congress has, for example, enacted the Private Securities&para;<br>Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 109 Stat. 737,&para;<br>which sought to combat perceived abuses in securities&para;<br>litigation with heightened pleading requirements, limits&para;<br>on damages and attorney’s fees, a “safe harbor” for certain&para;<br>kinds of statements, restrictions on the selection of lead&para;<br>plaintiffs in securities class actions, sanctions for frivolous&para;<br>litigation, and stays of discovery pending motions to dismiss. See Amgen, 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19–20).&para;<br>And to prevent plaintiffs from circumventing these restrictions by bringing securities class actions under state&para;<br>law in state court, Congress also enacted the Securities&para;<br>Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 3227,&para;<br>which precludes many state law class actions alleging&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>securities fraud. See Amgen, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 20).&para;<br>Such legislation demonstrates Congress’s willingness to&para;<br>consider policy concerns of the sort that Halliburton says&para;<br>should lead us to overrule Basic.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Halliburton proposes two alternatives to overruling&para;<br>Basic that would alleviate what it regards as the decision’s&para;<br>most serious flaws. The first alternative would require&para;<br>plaintiffs to prove that a defendant’s misrepresentation&para;<br>actually affected the stock price—so-called “price impact”—in order to invoke the Basic presumption. It should&para;<br>not be enough, Halliburton contends, for plaintiffs to&para;<br>demonstrate the general efficiency of the market in which&para;<br>the stock traded. Halliburton’s second proposed alternative would allow defendants to rebut the presumption of&para;<br>reliance with evidence of a lack of price impact, not only at&para;<br>the merits stage—which all agree defendants may already&para;<br>do—but also before class certification.&para;<br>A&para;<br>As noted, to invoke the Basic presumption, a plaintiff&para;<br>must prove that: (1) the alleged misrepresentations were&para;<br>publicly known, (2) they were material, (3) the stock traded&para;<br>in an efficient market, and (4) the plaintiff traded the&para;<br>stock between when the misrepresentations were made&para;<br>and when the truth was revealed. See Basic, 485 U. S., at&para;<br>248, n. 27; Amgen, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 15). Each of&para;<br>these requirements follows from the fraud-on-the-market&para;<br>theory underlying the presumption. If the misrepresentation was not publicly known, then it could not have distorted the stock’s market price. So too if the misrepresentation was immaterial—that is, if it would not have “ ‘been&para;<br>viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly&para;<br>altered the “total mix” of information made available,’ ”&para;<br>Basic, supra, at 231–232 (quoting TSC Industries, Inc. v.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 449 (1976))—or if the market in which the stock traded was inefficient. And if the&para;<br>plaintiff did not buy or sell the stock after the misrepresentation was made but before the truth was revealed,&para;<br>then he could not be said to have acted in reliance on a&para;<br>fraud-tainted price.&para;<br>The first three prerequisites are directed at price impact—“whether the alleged misrepresentations affected&para;<br>the market price in the first place.” Halliburton I, 563&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8). In the absence of price impact,&para;<br>Basic’s fraud-on-the-market theory and presumption of&para;<br>reliance collapse. The “fundamental premise” underlying&para;<br>the presumption is “that an investor presumptively relies&para;<br>on a misrepresentation so long as it was reflected in the&para;<br>market price at the time of his transaction.” 563 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 7). If it was not, then there is “no grounding for any contention that [the] investor[ ] indirectly&para;<br>relied on th[at] misrepresentation[ ] through [his] reliance&para;<br>on the integrity of the market price.” Amgen, supra, at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 17).&para;<br>Halliburton argues that since the Basic presumption&para;<br>hinges on price impact, plaintiffs should be required to&para;<br>prove it directly in order to invoke the presumption.&para;<br>Proving the presumption’s prerequisites, which are at best&para;<br>an imperfect proxy for price impact, should not suffice.&para;<br>Far from a modest refinement of the Basic presumption,&para;<br>this proposal would radically alter the required showing&para;<br>for the reliance element of the Rule 10b–5 cause of action.&para;<br>What is called the Basic presumption actually incorporates two constituent presumptions: First, if a plaintiff&para;<br>shows that the defendant’s misrepresentation was public&para;<br>and material and that the stock traded in a generally&para;<br>efficient market, he is entitled to a presumption that the&para;<br>misrepresentation affected the stock price. Second, if the&para;<br>plaintiff also shows that he purchased the stock at the&para;<br>market price during the relevant period, he is entitled to a&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>further presumption that he purchased the stock in reliance on the defendant’s misrepresentation.&para;<br>By requiring plaintiffs to prove price impact directly,&para;<br>Halliburton’s proposal would take away the first constituent presumption. Halliburton’s argument for doing so is&para;<br>the same as its primary argument for overruling the Basic&para;<br>presumption altogether: Because market efficiency is not a&para;<br>yes-or-no proposition, a public, material misrepresentation&para;<br>might not affect a stock’s price even in a generally efficient&para;<br>market. But as explained, Basic never suggested otherwise; that is why it affords defendants an opportunity to&para;<br>rebut the presumption by showing, among other things,&para;<br>that the particular misrepresentation at issue did not&para;<br>affect the stock’s market price. For the same reasons we&para;<br>declined to completely jettison the Basic presumption, we&para;<br>decline to effectively jettison half of it by revising the&para;<br>prerequisites for invoking it.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Even if plaintiffs need not directly prove price impact to&para;<br>invoke the Basic presumption, Halliburton contends that&para;<br>defendants should at least be allowed to defeat the presumption at the class certification stage through evidence&para;<br>that the misrepresentation did not in fact affect the stock&para;<br>price. We agree.&para;<br>1&para;<br>There is no dispute that defendants may introduce such&para;<br>evidence at the merits stage to rebut the Basic presumption. Basic itself “made clear that the presumption was&para;<br>just that, and could be rebutted by appropriate evidence,”&para;<br>including evidence that the asserted misrepresentation (or&para;<br>its correction) did not affect the market price of the defendant’s stock. Halliburton I, supra, at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>5); see Basic, supra, at 248.&para;<br>Nor is there any dispute that defendants may introduce&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>price impact evidence at the class certification stage, so&para;<br>long as it is for the purpose of countering a plaintiff’s&para;<br>showing of market efficiency, rather than directly rebutting the presumption. As EPJ Fund acknowledges, “[o]f&para;<br>course . . . defendants can introduce evidence at class&para;<br>certification of lack of price impact as some evidence that&para;<br>the market is not efficient.” Brief for Respondent 53. See&para;<br>also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26.&para;<br>After all, plaintiffs themselves can and do introduce&para;<br>evidence of the existence of price impact in connection with&para;<br>“event studies”—regression analyses that seek to show&para;<br>that the market price of the defendant’s stock tends to&para;<br>respond to pertinent publicly reported events. See Brief&para;<br>for Law Professors as Amici Curiae 25–28. In this case,&para;<br>for example, EPJ Fund submitted an event study of various episodes that might have been expected to affect the&para;<br>price of Halliburton’s stock, in order to demonstrate that&para;<br>the market for that stock takes account of material, public&para;<br>information about the company. See App. 217–230 (describing the results of the study). The episodes examined&para;<br>by EPJ Fund’s event study included one of the alleged&para;<br>misrepresentations that form the basis of the Fund’s suit.&para;<br>See id., at 230, 343–344. See also In re Xcelera.com Securities Litigation, 430 F. 3d 503, 513 (CA1 2005) (event&para;<br>study included effect of misrepresentation challenged in&para;<br>the case).&para;<br>Defendants—like plaintiffs—may accordingly submit&para;<br>price impact evidence prior to class certification. What&para;<br>defendants may not do, EPJ Fund insists and the Court of&para;<br>Appeals held, is rely on that same evidence prior to class&para;<br>certification for the particular purpose of rebutting the&para;<br>presumption altogether.&para;<br>This restriction makes no sense, and can readily lead to&para;<br>bizarre results. Suppose a defendant at the certification&para;<br>stage submits an event study looking at the impact on the&para;<br>price of its stock from six discrete events, in an effort to&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>refute the plaintiffs’ claim of general market efficiency.&para;<br>All agree the defendant may do this. Suppose one of the&para;<br>six events is the specific misrepresentation asserted by the&para;<br>plaintiffs. All agree that this too is perfectly acceptable.&para;<br>Now suppose the district court determines that, despite&para;<br>the defendant’s study, the plaintiff has carried its burden&para;<br>to prove market efficiency, but that the evidence shows no&para;<br>price impact with respect to the specific misrepresentation&para;<br>challenged in the suit. The evidence at the certification&para;<br>stage thus shows an efficient market, on which the alleged&para;<br>misrepresentation had no price impact. And yet under&para;<br>EPJ Fund’s view, the plaintiffs’ action should be certified&para;<br>and proceed as a class action (with all that entails), even&para;<br>though the fraud-on-the-market theory does not apply and&para;<br>common reliance thus cannot be presumed.&para;<br>Such a result is inconsistent with Basic’s own logic.&para;<br>Under Basic’s fraud-on-the-market theory, market efficiency and the other prerequisites for invoking the presumption constitute an indirect way of showing price&para;<br>impact. As explained, it is appropriate to allow plaintiffs&para;<br>to rely on this indirect proxy for price impact, rather than&para;<br>requiring them to prove price impact directly, given&para;<br>Basic’s rationales for recognizing a presumption of reliance in the first place. See supra, at 6–7, 16–17.&para;<br>But an indirect proxy should not preclude direct evidence when such evidence is available. As we explained in&para;<br>Basic, “[a]ny showing that severs the link between the&para;<br>alleged misrepresentation and . . . the price received (or&para;<br>paid) by the plaintiff . . . will be sufficient to rebut the&para;<br>presumption of reliance” because “the basis for finding&para;<br>that the fraud had been transmitted through market price&para;<br>would be gone.” 485 U. S., at 248. And without the presumption of reliance, a Rule 10b–5 suit cannot proceed as&para;<br>a class action: Each plaintiff would have to prove reliance&para;<br>individually, so common issues would not “predominate”&para;<br>over individual ones, as required by Rule 23(b)(3). Id., at&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>242. Price impact is thus an essential precondition for any&para;<br>Rule 10b–5 class action. While Basic allows plaintiffs to&para;<br>establish that precondition indirectly, it does not require&para;<br>courts to ignore a defendant’s direct, more salient evidence&para;<br>showing that the alleged misrepresentation did not actually&para;<br>affect the stock’s market price and, consequently, that&para;<br>the Basic presumption does not apply.&para;<br>2&para;<br>The Court of Appeals relied on our decision in Amgen in&para;<br>holding that Halliburton could not introduce evidence of&para;<br>lack of price impact at the class certification stage. The&para;<br>question in Amgen was whether plaintiffs could be required to prove (or defendants be permitted to disprove)&para;<br>materiality before class certification. Even though materiality is a prerequisite for invoking the Basic presumption, we held that it should be left to the merits stage,&para;<br>because it does not bear on the predominance requirement&para;<br>of Rule 23(b)(3). We reasoned that materiality is an objective issue susceptible to common, classwide proof. 568&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). We also noted that a failure&para;<br>to prove materiality would necessarily defeat every plaintiff ’s claim on the merits; it would not simply preclude&para;<br>invocation of the presumption and thereby cause individual&para;<br>questions of reliance to predominate over common ones.&para;<br>Ibid. See also id., at ___ (slip op., at 17–18). In this latter&para;<br>respect, we explained, materiality differs from the publicity&para;<br>and market efficiency prerequisites, neither of which is&para;<br>necessary to prove a Rule 10b–5 claim on the merits. Id.,&para;<br>at ___–___ (slip op., at 16–18).&para;<br>EPJ Fund argues that much of the foregoing could be&para;<br>said of price impact as well. Fair enough. But price impact differs from materiality in a crucial respect. Given&para;<br>that the other Basic prerequisites must still be proved at&para;<br>the class certification stage, the common issue of materiality can be left to the merits stage without risking the&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>HALLIBURTON CO. v. ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>certification of classes in which individual issues will end&para;<br>up overwhelming common ones. And because materiality&para;<br>is a discrete issue that can be resolved in isolation from&para;<br>the other prerequisites, it can be wholly confined to the&para;<br>merits stage.&para;<br>Price impact is different. The fact that a misrepresentation “was reflected in the market price at the time of [the]&para;<br>transaction”—that it had price impact—is “Basic’s fundamental premise.” Halliburton I, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 7). It thus has everything to do with the issue of predominance at the class certification stage. That is why, if&para;<br>reliance is to be shown through the Basic presumption,&para;<br>the publicity and market efficiency prerequisites must be&para;<br>proved before class certification. Without proof of those&para;<br>prerequisites, the fraud-on-the-market theory underlying&para;<br>the presumption completely collapses, rendering class&para;<br>certification inappropriate.&para;<br>But as explained, publicity and market efficiency are&para;<br>nothing more than prerequisites for an indirect showing of&para;<br>price impact. There is no dispute that at least such indirect proof of price impact “is needed to ensure that the&para;<br>questions of law or fact common to the class will ‘predominate.’ ” Amgen, 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (emphasis&para;<br>deleted); see id., at ___ (slip op., at 16–17). That is so even&para;<br>though such proof is also highly relevant at the merits&para;<br>stage.&para;<br>Our choice in this case, then, is not between allowing&para;<br>price impact evidence at the class certification stage or&para;<br>relegating it to the merits. Evidence of price impact will&para;<br>be before the court at the certification stage in any event.&para;<br>The choice, rather, is between limiting the price impact&para;<br>inquiry before class certification to indirect evidence, or&para;<br>allowing consideration of direct evidence as well. As&para;<br>explained, we see no reason to artificially limit the inquiry&para;<br>at the certification stage to indirect evidence of price&para;<br>impact. Defendants may seek to defeat the Basic pre-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sumption at that stage through direct as well as indirect&para;<br>price impact evidence.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>More than 25 years ago, we held that plaintiffs could&para;<br>satisfy the reliance element of the Rule 10b–5 cause of&para;<br>action by invoking a presumption that a public, material&para;<br>misrepresentation will distort the price of stock traded in&para;<br>an efficient market, and that anyone who purchases the&para;<br>stock at the market price may be considered to have done&para;<br>so in reliance on the misrepresentation. We adhere to that&para;<br>decision and decline to modify the prerequisites for invoking the presumption of reliance. But to maintain the&para;<br>consistency of the presumption with the class certification&para;<br>requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, defendants must be afforded an opportunity before class&para;<br>certification to defeat the presumption through evidence&para;<br>that an alleged misrepresentation did not actually affect&para;<br>the market price of the stock.&para;<br>Because the courts below denied Halliburton that opportunity, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals for&para;<br>the Fifth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

The Court&para;<br>reasoned that “ ‘ideally, [the market] transmits infor­&para;<br>mation to the investor in the processed form of a market&para;<br>price.’ ” Id., at 244. An investor could thus be said to have&para;<br>“relied” on a specific misstatement if (1) the market had&para;<br>incorporated that statement into the market price of the&para;<br>security, and (2) the investor then bought or sold that&para;<br>security “in reliance on the integrity of the [market] price,”&para;<br>id., at 247, i.e., based on his belief that the market price&para;<br>“ ‘reflect[ed]’ ” the stock’s underlying “ ‘value,’ ” id., at 244.&para;<br>Second, Basic created a presumption that this “indirect”&para;<br>form of “reliance” had been proved. Based primarily on&para;<br>certain assumptions about economic theory and investor&para;<br>behavior, Basic afforded plaintiffs who traded in efficient&para;<br>markets an evidentiary presumption that both steps of the&para;<br>novel reliance requirement had been satisfied—that (1)&para;<br>the market had incorporated the specific misstatement&para;<br>into the market price of the security, and (2) the plaintiff&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 In the years preceding Basic, lower courts and commentators exper­&para;<br>imented with various ways to facilitate 10b–5 class actions by relaxing&para;<br>or eliminating the reliance element of the implied 10b–5 action. See,&para;<br>e.g., Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F. 2d 891 (CA9 1975); Note, The Fraud-on­&para;<br>the-Market Theory, 95 Harv. L.

Second, Basic’s rebuttable presumption is at&para;<br>odds with our subsequent Rule 23 cases, which require&para;<br>plaintiffs seeking class certification to “ ‘affirmatively&para;<br>demonstrate’ ” certification requirements like the predom­&para;<br>inance of common questions.

The second was that investors in such markets&para;<br>transact “in reliance on the integrity of that price.” Ibid.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 An investor could invoke this presumption by demonstrating certain&para;<br>predicates: (1) a public statement; (2) an efficient market; (3) that the&para;<br>shares were traded after the statement was made but before the truth&para;<br>was revealed; and (4) that the statement was material.

Id., at 246.&para;<br>In reality, both of the Court’s key assumptions are&para;<br>highly contestable and do not provide the necessary sup­&para;<br>port for Basic’s presumption of reliance. The first assump­&para;<br>tion—that public statements are “reflected” in the market&para;<br>price—was grounded in an economic theory that has&para;<br>garnered substantial criticism since Basic. The second assumption—that investors categorically rely on the integrity&para;<br>of the market price—is simply wrong.&para;<br>1&para;<br>The Court’s first assumption was that “most publicly&para;<br>available information”—including public misstatements—&para;<br>“is reflected in [the] market price” of a security.

Id., at 246–247.&para;<br>Specifically, the Court relied upon the “semi-strong” ver­&para;<br>sion of that theory, which posits that the average investor&para;<br>cannot earn above-market returns (i.e., “beat the market”)&para;<br>in an efficient market by trading on the basis of publicly&para;<br>available information.

In sum, economists&para;<br>now understand that the price impact Basic assumed&para;<br>would happen reflexively is actually far from certain even&para;<br>in “well-developed” markets. Thus, Basic’s claim that&para;<br>“common sense and probability” support a presumption of&para;<br>reliance rests on shaky footing.&para;<br>2&para;<br>The Basic Court also grounded the presumption of&para;<br>reliance in a second assumption: that “[a]n investor who&para;<br>buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in&para;<br>reliance on the integrity of that price.” 485 U.

See id., at&para;<br>244 (“ ‘[P]urchasers generally rely on the price of the stock&para;<br>as a reflection of its value’ ”).

It cannot be seriously disputed that a&para;<br>great many investors do not buy or sell stock based on a&para;<br>belief that the stock’s price accurately reflects its value.&para;<br>Many investors in fact trade for the opposite reason—that&para;<br>is, because they think the market has under- or overval­&para;<br>ued the stock, and they believe they can profit from that&para;<br>mispricing.

But, invoking the Basic presump­&para;<br>tion does not actually prove that individual questions of&para;<br>reliance will not overwhelm the common questions in the&para;<br>case. Basic still requires a showing that the individual&para;<br>investor bought or sold in reliance on the integrity of the&para;<br>market price and, crucially, permits defendants to rebut&para;<br>the presumption by producing evidence that individual&para;<br>plaintiffs do not meet that description. See id., at 249&para;<br>(“Petitioners . . . could rebut the presumption of reliance&para;<br>as to plaintiffs who would have divested themselves of&para;<br>their Basic shares without relying on the integrity of the&para;<br>market”). Thus, by its own terms, Basic entitles defend­&para;<br>ants to ask each class member whether he traded in reli­&para;<br>ance on the integrity of the market price. That inquiry,&para;<br>like the traditional reliance inquiry, is inherently individ­&para;<br>ualized; questions about the trading strategies of individ­&para;<br>ual investors will not generate “ ‘common answers apt to&para;<br>drive the resolution of the litigation,’ ” Wal-Mart Stores,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10).

Plaintiffs who invoke the presumption&para;<br>of reliance are deemed to have shown predominance as a&para;<br>matter of law, even though the resulting rebuttable pre­&para;<br>sumption leaves individualized questions of reliance in the&para;<br>case and predominance still unproved. Needless to say,&para;<br>that exemption was beyond the Basic Court’s power to&para;<br>grant.6&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The majority suggests that Basic squares with Comcast Corp. v.&para;<br>Behrend, 569 U.

See&para;<br>Grundfest, Damages and Reliance Under Section 10(b) of&para;<br>the Exchange Act, 69 Bus. Lawyer 307, 362 (2014). After&para;<br>class certification, courts have refused to allow defendants&para;<br>to challenge any plaintiff ’s reliance on the integrity of the&para;<br>market price prior to a determination on classwide liabil­&para;<br>ity.
