GALLOWAY ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–696.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued November 6, 2013—Decided May 5, 2014&para;<br>&para;<br>Since 1999, the monthly town board meetings in Greece, New York,&para;<br>have opened with a roll call, a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance,&para;<br>and a prayer given by clergy selected from the congregations listed in&para;<br>a local directory. While the prayer program is open to all creeds,&para;<br>nearly all of the local congregations are Christian; thus, nearly all of&para;<br>the participating prayer givers have been too. Respondents, citizens&para;<br>who attend meetings to speak on local issues, filed suit, alleging that&para;<br>the town violated the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause by&para;<br>preferring Christians over other prayer givers and by sponsoring sectarian prayers. They sought to limit the town to “inclusive and ecumenical” prayers that referred only to a “generic God.” The District&para;<br>Court upheld the prayer practice on summary judgment, finding no&para;<br>impermissible preference for Christianity; concluding that the Christian identity of most of the prayer givers reflected the predominantly&para;<br>Christian character of the town’s congregations, not an official policy&para;<br>or practice of discriminating against minority faiths; finding that the&para;<br>First Amendment did not require Greece to invite clergy from congregations beyond its borders to achieve religious diversity; and rejecting the theory that legislative prayer must be nonsectarian. The&para;<br>Second Circuit reversed, holding that some aspects of the prayer program, viewed in their totality by a reasonable observer, conveyed the&para;<br>message that Greece was endorsing Christianity.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is reversed.&para;<br>681 F. 3d 20, reversed.&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to&para;<br>Part II–B, concluding that the town’s prayer practice does not violate&para;<br>the Establishment Clause.

GALLOWAY&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(a) Legislative prayer, while religious in nature, has long been understood as compatible with the Establishment Clause. Marsh v.&para;<br>Chambers, 463 U. S. 783, 792. In Marsh, the Court concluded that it&para;<br>was not necessary to define the Establishment Clause’s precise&para;<br>boundary in order to uphold Nebraska’s practice of employing a legislative chaplain because history supported the conclusion that the&para;<br>specific practice was permitted. The First Congress voted to appoint&para;<br>and pay official chaplains shortly after approving language for the&para;<br>First Amendment, and both Houses have maintained the office virtually uninterrupted since then. See id., at 787–789, and n. 10. A majority of the States have also had a consistent practice of legislative&para;<br>prayer. Id., at 788–790, and n. 11. There is historical precedent for&para;<br>the practice of opening local legislative meetings with prayer as well.&para;<br>Marsh teaches that the Establishment Clause must be interpreted&para;<br>“by reference to historical practices and understandings.” County of&para;<br>Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh&para;<br>Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 670 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Thus, any test&para;<br>must acknowledge a practice that was accepted by the Framers and&para;<br>has withstood the critical scrutiny of time and political change. The&para;<br>Court’s inquiry, then, must be to determine whether the prayer practice in the town of Greece fits within the tradition long followed in&para;<br>Congress and the state legislatures. Pp. 6–9.&para;<br>(b) Respondents’ insistence on nonsectarian prayer is not consistent with this tradition. The prayers in Marsh were consistent&para;<br>with the First Amendment not because they espoused only a generic&para;<br>theism but because the Nation’s history and tradition have shown&para;<br>that prayer in this limited context could “coexis[t] with the principles&para;<br>of disestablishment and religious freedom.” 463 U. S., at 786. Dictum in County of Allegheny suggesting that Marsh permitted only&para;<br>prayer with no overtly Christian references is irreconcilable with the&para;<br>facts, holding, and reasoning of Marsh, which instructed that the&para;<br>“content of the prayer is not of concern to judges,” provided “there is&para;<br>no indication that the prayer opportunity has been exploited to proselytize or advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief.”&para;<br>463 U. S., at 794–795. To hold that invocations must be nonsectarian&para;<br>would force the legislatures sponsoring prayers and the courts deciding these cases to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech,&para;<br>thus involving government in religious matters to a far greater degree than is the case under the town’s current practice of neither editing nor approving prayers in advance nor criticizing their content&para;<br>after the fact. Respondents’ contrary arguments are unpersuasive.&para;<br>It is doubtful that consensus could be reached as to what qualifies as&para;<br>a generic or nonsectarian prayer. It would also be unwise to conclude&para;<br>that only those religious words acceptable to the majority are permis-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>sible, for the First Amendment is not a majority rule and government&para;<br>may not seek to define permissible categories of religious speech. In&para;<br>rejecting the suggestion that legislative prayer must be nonsectarian,&para;<br>the Court does not imply that no constraints remain on its content.&para;<br>The relevant constraint derives from the prayer’s place at the opening of legislative sessions, where it is meant to lend gravity to the occasion and reflect values long part of the Nation’s heritage. From the&para;<br>Nation’s earliest days, invocations have been addressed to assemblies&para;<br>comprising many different creeds, striving for the idea that people of&para;<br>many faiths may be united in a community of tolerance and devotion,&para;<br>even if they disagree as to religious doctrine. The prayers delivered&para;<br>in Greece do not fall outside this tradition. They may have invoked,&para;<br>e.g., the name of Jesus, but they also invoked universal themes, e.g.,&para;<br>by calling for a “spirit of cooperation.” Absent a pattern of prayers&para;<br>that over time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermissible government purpose, a challenge based solely on the content of a particular prayer will not likely establish a constitutional violation. See&para;<br>463 U. S., at 794–795. Finally, so long as the town maintains a policy&para;<br>of nondiscrimination, the Constitution does not require it to search&para;<br>beyond its borders for non-Christian prayer givers in an effort to&para;<br>achieve religious balancing. Pp. 9–18.&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE ALITO,&para;<br>concluded in Part II–B that a fact-sensitive inquiry that considers&para;<br>both the setting in which the prayer arises and the audience to whom&para;<br>it is directed shows that the town is not coercing its citizens to engage&para;<br>in a religious observance. The prayer opportunity is evaluated&para;<br>against the backdrop of a historical practice showing that prayer has&para;<br>become part of the Nation’s heritage and tradition. It is presumed&para;<br>that the reasonable observer is acquainted with this tradition and&para;<br>understands that its purposes are to lend gravity to public proceedings and to acknowledge the place religion holds in the lives of many&para;<br>private citizens. Furthermore, the principal audience for these invocations is not the public, but the lawmakers themselves. And those&para;<br>lawmakers did not direct the public to participate, single out dissidents for opprobrium, or indicate that their decisions might be influenced by a person’s acquiescence in the prayer opportunity. Respondents claim that the prayers gave them offense and made them&para;<br>feel excluded and disrespected, but offense does not equate to coercion. In contrast to Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, where the Court&para;<br>found coercive a religious invocation at a high school graduation, id.,&para;<br>at 592–594, the record here does not suggest that citizens are dissuaded from leaving the meeting room during the prayer, arriving&para;<br>late, or making a later protest. That the prayer in Greece is delivered during the opening ceremonial portion of the town’s meeting, not&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>the policymaking portion, also suggests that its purpose and effect&para;<br>are to acknowledge religious leaders and their institutions, not to exclude or coerce nonbelievers. Pp. 18–23.&para;<br>JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA as to Part II, agreed&para;<br>that the town’s prayer practice does not violate the Establishment&para;<br>Clause, but concluded that, even if the Establishment Clause were&para;<br>properly incorporated against the States through the Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment, the Clause is not violated by the kind of subtle pressures respondents allegedly suffered, which do not amount to actual&para;<br>legal coercion. The municipal prayers in this case bear no resemblance to the coercive state establishments that existed at the founding, which exercised government power in order to exact financial&para;<br>support of the church, compel religious observance, or control religious doctrine.

For some years, it began its monthly town&para;<br>board meetings with a moment of silence.

The prayer was intended to place town board&para;<br>members in a solemn and deliberative frame of mind,&para;<br>invoke divine guidance in town affairs, and follow a tradi­&para;<br>tion practiced by Congress and dozens of state legisla­&para;<br>tures. App. 22a–25a.&para;<br>The town followed an informal method for selecting&para;<br>prayer givers, all of whom were unpaid volunteers. A&para;<br>town employee would call the congregations listed in a&para;<br>local directory until she found a minister available for that&para;<br>month’s meeting. The town eventually compiled a list of&para;<br>willing “board chaplains” who had accepted invitations&para;<br>and agreed to return in the future. The town at no point&para;<br>excluded or denied an opportunity to a would-be prayer&para;<br>giver. Its leaders maintained that a minister or layperson&para;<br>of any persuasion, including an atheist, could give the&para;<br>invocation. But nearly all of the congregations in town&para;<br>were Christian; and from 1999 to 2007, all of the partici­&para;<br>pating ministers were too.&para;<br>Greece neither reviewed the prayers in advance of the&para;<br>meetings nor provided guidance as to their tone or con­&para;<br>tent, in the belief that exercising any degree of control&para;<br>over the prayers would infringe both the free exercise and&para;<br>speech rights of the ministers. Id., at 22a. The town&para;<br>instead left the guest clergy free to compose their own&para;<br>devotions. The resulting prayers often sounded both civic&para;<br>and religious themes. Typical were invocations that asked&para;<br>the divinity to abide at the meeting and bestow blessings&para;<br>on the community:&para;<br>“Lord we ask you to send your spirit of servanthood&para;<br>upon all of us gathered here this evening to do your&para;<br>work for the benefit of all in our community.

We ask this in the name&para;<br>of our brother Jesus. Amen.” Id., at 45a.&para;<br>Some of the ministers spoke in a distinctly Christian&para;<br>idiom; and a minority invoked religious holidays, scrip­&para;<br>ture, or doctrine, as in the following prayer:&para;<br>“Lord, God of all creation, we give you thanks and&para;<br>praise for your presence and action in the world. We&para;<br>look with anticipation to the celebration of Holy Week&para;<br>and Easter.

After respondents complained that Chris­&para;<br>tian themes pervaded the prayers, to the exclusion of&para;<br>citizens who did not share those beliefs, the town invited a&para;<br>Jewish layman and the chairman of the local Baha’i tem­&para;<br>ple to deliver prayers.

GALLOWAY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>press reports about the prayer controversy requested, and&para;<br>was granted, an opportunity to give the invocation.&para;<br>Galloway and Stephens brought suit in the United&para;<br>States District Court for the Western District of New&para;<br>York. They alleged that the town violated the First&para;<br>Amendment’s Establishment Clause by preferring Chris­&para;<br>tians over other prayer givers and by sponsoring sectarian&para;<br>prayers, such as those given “in Jesus’ name.” 732&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 195, 203 (2010). They did not seek an end to&para;<br>the prayer practice, but rather requested an injunction&para;<br>that would limit the town to “inclusive and ecumenical”&para;<br>prayers that referred only to a “generic God” and would&para;<br>not associate the government with any one faith or belief.&para;<br>Id., at 210, 241.&para;<br>The District Court on summary judgment upheld the&para;<br>prayer practice as consistent with the First Amendment.&para;<br>It found no impermissible preference for Christianity,&para;<br>noting that the town had opened the prayer program to all&para;<br>creeds and excluded none. Although most of the prayer&para;<br>givers were Christian, this fact reflected only the predom­&para;<br>inantly Christian identity of the town’s congregations,&para;<br>rather than an official policy or practice of discriminating&para;<br>against minority faiths. The District Court found no&para;<br>authority for the proposition that the First Amendment&para;<br>required Greece to invite clergy from congregations be­&para;<br>yond its borders in order to achieve a minimum level of&para;<br>religious diversity.&para;<br>The District Court also rejected the theory that legisla­&para;<br>tive prayer must be nonsectarian. The court began its&para;<br>inquiry with the opinion in Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S.&para;<br>783, which permitted prayer in state legislatures by a&para;<br>chaplain paid from the public purse, so long as the prayer&para;<br>opportunity was not “exploited to proselytize or advance&para;<br>any one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief,” id., at&para;<br>794–795. With respect to the prayer in Greece, the Dis­&para;<br>trict Court concluded that references to Jesus, and the&para;<br>occasional request that the audience stand for the prayer,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>did not amount to impermissible proselytizing. It located&para;<br>in Marsh no additional requirement that the prayers be&para;<br>purged of sectarian content. In this regard the court&para;<br>quoted recent invocations offered in the U. S. House of&para;<br>Representatives “in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,”&para;<br>e.g., 156 Cong Rec. H5205 (June 30, 2010), and situated&para;<br>prayer in this context as part a long tradition. Finally, the&para;<br>trial court noted this Court’s statement in County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 603 (1989), that the prayers&para;<br>in Marsh did not offend the Establishment Clause “be­&para;<br>cause the particular chaplain had ‘removed all references&para;<br>to Christ.’ ” But the District Court did not read that&para;<br>statement to mandate that legislative prayer be nonsec­&para;<br>tarian, at least in circumstances where the town permitted&para;<br>clergy from a variety of faiths to give invocations. By&para;<br>welcoming many viewpoints, the District Court concluded,&para;<br>the town would be unlikely to give the impression that it&para;<br>was affiliating itself with any one religion.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed.&para;<br>681 F. 3d 20, 34 (2012). It held that some aspects of the&para;<br>prayer program, viewed in their totality by a reasonable&para;<br>observer, conveyed the message that Greece was endors­&para;<br>ing Christianity. The town’s failure to promote the prayer&para;<br>opportunity to the public, or to invite ministers from con­&para;<br>gregations outside the town limits, all but “ensured a&para;<br>Christian viewpoint.” Id., at 30–31. Although the court&para;<br>found no inherent problem in the sectarian content of the&para;<br>prayers, it concluded that the “steady drumbeat” of Chris­&para;<br>tian prayer, unbroken by invocations from other faith&para;<br>traditions, tended to affiliate the town with Christianity.&para;<br>Id., at 32. Finally, the court found it relevant that guest&para;<br>clergy sometimes spoke on behalf of all present at the&para;<br>meeting, as by saying “let us pray,” or by asking audience&para;<br>members to stand and bow their heads: “The invitation . . .&para;<br>to participate in the prayer . . . placed audience members&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v.

That board&para;<br>members bowed their heads or made the sign of the cross&para;<br>further conveyed the message that the town endorsed&para;<br>Christianity. The Court of Appeals emphasized that it&para;<br>was the “interaction of the facts present in this case,”&para;<br>rather than any single element, that rendered the prayer&para;<br>unconstitutional. Id., at 33.&para;<br>Having granted certiorari to decide whether the town’s&para;<br>prayer practice violates the Establishment Clause, 569&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2013), the Court now reverses the judgment of&para;<br>the Court of Appeals.&para;<br>II&para;<br>In Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783, the Court found&para;<br>no First Amendment violation in the Nebraska Legisla­&para;<br>ture’s practice of opening its sessions with a prayer deliv­&para;<br>ered by a chaplain paid from state funds. The decision&para;<br>concluded that legislative prayer, while religious in na­&para;<br>ture, has long been understood as compatible with the&para;<br>Establishment Clause. As practiced by Congress since the&para;<br>framing of the Constitution, legislative prayer lends gravity to public business, reminds lawmakers to transcend&para;<br>petty differences in pursuit of a higher purpose, and ex­&para;<br>presses a common aspiration to a just and peaceful society. See Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 693 (1984)&para;<br>(O’Connor, J., concurring); cf. A. Adams &amp; C. Emmerich, A&para;<br>Nation Dedicated to Religious Liberty 83 (1990). The&para;<br>Court has considered this symbolic expression to be a&para;<br>“tolerable acknowledgement of beliefs widely held,” Marsh,&para;<br>463 U. S., at 792, rather than a first, treacherous step&para;<br>towards establishment of a state church.&para;<br>Marsh is sometimes described as “carving out an excep­&para;<br>tion” to the Court’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Id., at 796, 813 (Bren­&para;<br>nan, J., dissenting). The Court in Marsh found those tests&para;<br>unnecessary because history supported the conclusion that&para;<br>legislative invocations are compatible with the Establish­&para;<br>ment Clause. The First Congress made it an early item of&para;<br>business to appoint and pay official chaplains, and both&para;<br>the House and Senate have maintained the office virtually&para;<br>uninterrupted since that time. See id., at 787–789, and&para;<br>n. 10; N. Feldman, Divided by God 109 (2005). But see&para;<br>Marsh, supra, at 791–792, and n. 12 (noting dissenting&para;<br>views among the Framers); Madison, “Detached Memo­&para;<br>randa”, 3 Wm. &amp; Mary Quarterly 534, 558–559 (1946)&para;<br>(hereinafter Madison’s Detached Memoranda).&para;<br>When&para;<br>Marsh was decided, in 1983, legislative prayer had per­&para;<br>sisted in the Nebraska Legislature for more than a century, and the majority of the other States also had the&para;<br>same, consistent practice. 463 U. S., at 788–790, and n. 11.&para;<br>Although no information has been cited by the parties to&para;<br>indicate how many local legislative bodies open their&para;<br>meetings with prayer, this practice too has historical&para;<br>precedent. See Reports of Proceedings of the City Council&para;<br>of Boston for the Year Commencing Jan. 1, 1909, and&para;<br>Ending Feb. 5, 1910, pp. 1–2 (1910) (Rev. Arthur Little)&para;<br>(“And now we desire to invoke Thy presence, Thy blessing,&para;<br>and Thy guidance upon those who are gathered here this&para;<br>morning . . .”). “In light of the unambiguous and unbroken&para;<br>history of more than 200 years, there can be no doubt that&para;<br>the practice of opening legislative sessions with a prayer&para;<br>has become part of the fabric of our society.” Marsh,&para;<br>supra, at 792.&para;<br>Yet Marsh must not be understood as permitting a&para;<br>practice that would amount to a constitutional violation if&para;<br>not for its historical foundation. The case teaches instead&para;<br>that the Establishment Clause must be interpreted “by&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v.

That&para;<br>the First Congress provided for the appointment of chap­&para;<br>lains only days after approving language for the First&para;<br>Amendment demonstrates that the Framers considered&para;<br>legislative prayer a benign acknowledgment of religion’s&para;<br>role in society. D. Currie, The Constitution in Congress:&para;<br>The Federalist Period 1789–1801, pp. 12–13 (1997). In the&para;<br>1850’s, the judiciary committees in both the House and&para;<br>Senate reevaluated the practice of official chaplaincies&para;<br>after receiving petitions to abolish the office. The commit­&para;<br>tees concluded that the office posed no threat of an estab­&para;<br>lishment because lawmakers were not compelled to attend&para;<br>the daily prayer, S. Rep. No. 376, 32d Cong., 2d Sess., 2&para;<br>(1853); no faith was excluded by law, nor any favored, id.,&para;<br>at 3; and the cost of the chaplain’s salary imposed a van­&para;<br>ishingly small burden on taxpayers, H. Rep. No. 124, 33d&para;<br>Cong., 1st Sess., 6 (1854). Marsh stands for the proposi­&para;<br>tion that it is not necessary to define the precise boundary&para;<br>of the Establishment Clause where history shows that the&para;<br>specific practice is permitted.

Respondents assert that the town’s prayer exercise&para;<br>falls outside that tradition and transgresses the Estab­&para;<br>lishment Clause for two independent but mutually rein­&para;<br>forcing reasons. First, they argue that Marsh did not&para;<br>approve prayers containing sectarian language or themes,&para;<br>such as the prayers offered in Greece that referred to the&para;<br>“death, resurrection, and ascension of the Savior Jesus&para;<br>Christ,” App. 129a, and the “saving sacrifice of Jesus&para;<br>Christ on the cross,” id., at 88a. Second, they argue that&para;<br>the setting and conduct of the town board meetings create&para;<br>social pressures that force nonadherents to remain in the&para;<br>room or even feign participation in order to avoid offend­&para;<br>ing the representatives who sponsor the prayer and will&para;<br>vote on matters citizens bring before the board. The sec­&para;<br>tarian content of the prayers compounds the subtle coer­&para;<br>cive pressures, they argue, because the nonbeliever who&para;<br>might tolerate ecumenical prayer is forced to do the same&para;<br>for prayer that might be inimical to his or her beliefs.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Respondents maintain that prayer must be nonsectarian,&para;<br>or not identifiable with any one religion; and they fault&para;<br>the town for permitting guest chaplains to deliver prayers&para;<br>that “use overtly Christian terms” or “invoke specifics of&para;<br>Christian theology.” Brief for Respondents 20. A prayer is&para;<br>fitting for the public sphere, in their view, only if it con­&para;<br>tains the ‘ “most general, nonsectarian reference to God,’ ”&para;<br>id., at 33 (quoting M. Meyerson, Endowed by Our Creator:&para;<br>The Birth of Religious Freedom in America 11–12 (2012)),&para;<br>and eschews mention of doctrines associated with any one&para;<br>faith, Brief for Respondents 32–33. They argue that prayer&para;<br>which contemplates “the workings of the Holy Spirit, the&para;<br>events of Pentecost, and the belief that God ‘has raised&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>up the Lord Jesus’ and ‘will raise us, in our turn, and put&para;<br>us by His side’ ” would be impermissible, as would any&para;<br>prayer that reflects dogma particular to a single faith&para;<br>tradition. Id., at 34 (quoting App. 89a and citing id., at&para;<br>56a, 123a, 134a).&para;<br>An insistence on nonsectarian or ecumenical prayer as a&para;<br>single, fixed standard is not consistent with the tradition&para;<br>of legislative prayer outlined in the Court’s cases. The&para;<br>Court found the prayers in Marsh consistent with the&para;<br>First Amendment not because they espoused only a generic theism but because our history and tradition have&para;<br>shown that prayer in this limited context could “coexis[t]&para;<br>with the principles of disestablishment and religious&para;<br>freedom.” 463 U. S., at 786. The Congress that drafted&para;<br>the First Amendment would have been accustomed to&para;<br>invocations containing explicitly religious themes of the&para;<br>sort respondents find objectionable. One of the Senate’s&para;<br>first chaplains, the Rev. William White, gave prayers in a&para;<br>series that included the Lord’s Prayer, the Collect for&para;<br>Ash Wednesday, prayers for peace and grace, a general&para;<br>thanksgiving, St. Chrysostom’s Prayer, and a prayer&para;<br>seeking “the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, &amp;c.” Letter&para;<br>from W. White to H. Jones (Dec. 29, 1830), in B. Wilson,&para;<br>Memoir of the Life of the Right Reverend William White,&para;<br>D.

The decidedly Christian nature of these prayers&para;<br>must not be dismissed as the relic of a time when our&para;<br>Nation was less pluralistic than it is today. Congress&para;<br>continues to permit its appointed and visiting chaplains to&para;<br>express themselves in a religious idiom. It acknowledges&para;<br>our growing diversity not by proscribing sectarian content&para;<br>but by welcoming ministers of many creeds. See, e.g., 160&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

There the Court held that&para;<br>a crèche placed on the steps of a county courthouse to&para;<br>celebrate the Christmas season violated the Establish­&para;<br>ment Clause because it had “the effect of endorsing a&para;<br>patently Christian message.” Id., at 601. Four dissenting&para;<br>Justices disputed that endorsement could be the proper&para;<br>test, as it likely would condemn a host of traditional prac­&para;<br>tices that recognize the role religion plays in our society,&para;<br>among them legislative prayer and the “forthrightly reli­&para;<br>gious” Thanksgiving proclamations issued by nearly every&para;<br>President since Washington. Id., at 670–671. The Court&para;<br>sought to counter this criticism by recasting Marsh to&para;<br>permit only prayer that contained no overtly Christian&para;<br>references:&para;<br>“However history may affect the constitutionality of&para;<br>nonsectarian references to religion by the government,&para;<br>history cannot legitimate practices that demonstrate&para;<br>the government’s allegiance to a particular sect or&para;<br>creed . . . . The legislative prayers involved in Marsh&para;<br>did not violate this principle because the particular&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v.

Marsh nowhere sug­&para;<br>gested that the constitutionality of legislative prayer turns&para;<br>on the neutrality of its content. The opinion noted that&para;<br>Nebraska’s chaplain, the Rev. Robert E. Palmer, modulated the “explicitly Christian” nature of his prayer and&para;<br>“removed all references to Christ” after a Jewish law­&para;<br>maker complained. 463 U. S., at 793, n. 14. With this foot­&para;<br>note, the Court did no more than observe the practical&para;<br>demands placed on a minister who holds a permanent,&para;<br>appointed position in a legislature and chooses to write his&para;<br>or her prayers to appeal to more members, or at least to&para;<br>give less offense to those who object. See Mallory, “An&para;<br>Officer of the House Which Chooses Him, and Nothing&para;<br>More”: How Should Marsh v. Chambers Apply to Rotating&para;<br>Chaplains?, 73 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1421, 1445 (2006). Marsh&para;<br>did not suggest that Nebraska’s prayer practice would&para;<br>have failed had the chaplain not acceded to the legislator’s&para;<br>request. Nor did the Court imply the rule that prayer&para;<br>violates the Establishment Clause any time it is given in&para;<br>the name of a figure deified by only one faith or creed. See&para;<br>Van Orden, 545 U. S., at 688, n. 8 (recognizing that the&para;<br>prayers in Marsh were “often explicitly Christian” and&para;<br>rejecting the view that this gave rise to an establishment&para;<br>violation). To the contrary, the Court instructed that the&para;<br>“content of the prayer is not of concern to judges,” provided&para;<br>“there is no indication that the prayer opportunity has&para;<br>been exploited to proselytize or advance any one, or to&para;<br>disparage any other, faith or belief.” 463 U.

Cf. Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, 565 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 13–14). Our Government is&para;<br>prohibited from prescribing prayers to be recited in our&para;<br>public institutions in order to promote a preferred system&para;<br>of belief or code of moral behavior. Engel v. Vitale, 370&para;<br>U. S. 421, 430 (1962). It would be but a few steps removed&para;<br>from that prohibition for legislatures to require chaplains&para;<br>to redact the religious content from their message in order&para;<br>to make it acceptable for the public sphere. Government&para;<br>may not mandate a civic religion that stifles any but the&para;<br>most generic reference to the sacred any more than it may&para;<br>prescribe a religious orthodoxy. See Lee v. Weisman, 505&para;<br>U. S. 577, 590 (1992) (“The suggestion that government&para;<br>may establish an official or civic religion as a means of&para;<br>avoiding the establishment of a religion with more specific&para;<br>creeds strikes us as a contradiction that cannot be accepted”); Schempp, 374 U. S., at 306 (Goldberg, J., concur­&para;<br>ring) (arguing that “untutored devotion to the concept of&para;<br>neutrality” must not lead to “a brooding and pervasive&para;<br>devotion to the secular”).&para;<br>Respondents argue, in effect, that legislative prayer may&para;<br>be addressed only to a generic God. The law and the&para;<br>Court could not draw this line for each specific prayer or&para;<br>seek to require ministers to set aside their nuanced and&para;<br>deeply personal beliefs for vague and artificial ones.&para;<br>There is doubt, in any event, that consensus might be&para;<br>reached as to what qualifies as generic or nonsectarian.&para;<br>Honorifics like “Lord of Lords” or “King of Kings” might&para;<br>strike a Christian audience as ecumenical, yet these titles&para;<br>may have no place in the vocabulary of other faith tradi­&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tions. The difficulty, indeed the futility, of sifting sectarian&para;<br>from nonsectarian speech is illustrated by a letter that&para;<br>a lawyer for the respondents sent the town in the early&para;<br>stages of this litigation. The letter opined that references&para;<br>to “Father, God, Lord God, and the Almighty” would be&para;<br>acceptable in public prayer, but that references to “Jesus&para;<br>Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Trinity” would not.&para;<br>App. 21a. Perhaps the writer believed the former group­&para;<br>ing would be acceptable to monotheists. Yet even seem­&para;<br>ingly general references to God or the Father might alien­&para;<br>ate nonbelievers or polytheists. McCreary County v.&para;<br>American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U. S. 844, 893&para;<br>(2005) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Because it is unlikely that&para;<br>prayer will be inclusive beyond dispute, it would be un­&para;<br>wise to adopt what respondents think is the next-best&para;<br>option: permitting those religious words, and only those&para;<br>words, that are acceptable to the majority, even if they&para;<br>will exclude some. Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U. S. 488, 495&para;<br>(1961). The First Amendment is not a majority rule, and&para;<br>government may not seek to define permissible categories&para;<br>of religious speech. Once it invites prayer into the public&para;<br>sphere, government must permit a prayer giver to address&para;<br>his or her own God or gods as conscience dictates, unfet­&para;<br>tered by what an administrator or judge considers to be&para;<br>nonsectarian.&para;<br>In rejecting the suggestion that legislative prayer must&para;<br>be nonsectarian, the Court does not imply that no con­&para;<br>straints remain on its content. The relevant constraint&para;<br>derives from its place at the opening of legislative ses­&para;<br>sions, where it is meant to lend gravity to the occasion and&para;<br>reflect values long part of the Nation’s heritage. Prayer&para;<br>that is solemn and respectful in tone, that invites law­&para;<br>makers to reflect upon shared ideals and common ends&para;<br>before they embark on the fractious business of governing,&para;<br>serves that legitimate function. If the course and practice&para;<br>over time shows that the invocations denigrate nonbeliev­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ers or religious minorities, threaten damnation, or preach&para;<br>conversion, many present may consider the prayer to fall&para;<br>short of the desire to elevate the purpose of the occasion&para;<br>and to unite lawmakers in their common effort. That&para;<br>circumstance would present a different case than the one&para;<br>presently before the Court.&para;<br>The tradition reflected in Marsh permits chaplains to&para;<br>ask their own God for blessings of peace, justice, and&para;<br>freedom that find appreciation among people of all faiths.&para;<br>That a prayer is given in the name of Jesus, Allah, or&para;<br>Jehovah, or that it makes passing reference to religious&para;<br>doctrines, does not remove it from that tradition. These&para;<br>religious themes provide particular means to universal&para;<br>ends. Prayer that reflects beliefs specific to only some&para;<br>creeds can still serve to solemnize the occasion, so long as&para;<br>the practice over time is not “exploited to proselytize or&para;<br>advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or be­&para;<br>lief.” Marsh, 463 U. S., at 794–795.&para;<br>It is thus possible to discern in the prayers offered to&para;<br>Congress a commonality of theme and tone. While these&para;<br>prayers vary in their degree of religiosity, they often seek&para;<br>peace for the Nation, wisdom for its lawmakers, and jus­&para;<br>tice for its people, values that count as universal and that&para;<br>are embodied not only in religious traditions, but in our&para;<br>founding documents and laws. The first prayer delivered&para;<br>to the Continental Congress by the Rev. Jacob Duché on&para;<br>Sept. 7, 1774, provides an example:&para;<br>“Be Thou present O God of Wisdom and direct the&para;<br>counsel of this Honorable Assembly; enable them to&para;<br>settle all things on the best and surest foundations;&para;<br>that the scene of blood may be speedily closed; that&para;<br>Order, Harmony, and Peace be effectually restored,&para;<br>and the Truth and Justice, Religion and Piety, prevail&para;<br>and flourish among the people.&para;<br>“Preserve the health of their bodies, and the vigor of&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v.

These ceremonial prayers strive for the&para;<br>idea that people of many faiths may be united in a com­&para;<br>munity of tolerance and devotion. Even those who disagree as to religious doctrine may find common ground in&para;<br>the desire to show respect for the divine in all aspects of&para;<br>their lives and being. Our tradition assumes that adult&para;<br>citizens, firm in their own beliefs, can tolerate and per­&para;<br>haps appreciate a ceremonial prayer delivered by a person&para;<br>of a different faith. See Letter from John Adams to Abi­&para;<br>gail Adams (Sept. 16, 1774), in C. Adams, Familiar Letters&para;<br>of John Adams and His Wife Abigail Adams, During the&para;<br>Revolution 37–38 (1876).&para;<br>The prayers delivered in the town of Greece do not fall&para;<br>outside the tradition this Court has recognized. A number&para;<br>of the prayers did invoke the name of Jesus, the Heavenly&para;<br>Father, or the Holy Spirit, but they also invoked universal&para;<br>themes, as by celebrating the changing of the seasons or&para;<br>calling for a “spirit of cooperation” among town leaders.&para;<br>App. 31a, 38a. Among numerous examples of such prayer&para;<br>in the record is the invocation given by the Rev. Richard&para;<br>Barbour at the September 2006 board meeting:&para;<br>“Gracious God, you have richly blessed our nation&para;<br>and this community.

Respectful of every religious tradition, I offer&para;<br>this prayer in the name of God’s only son Jesus&para;<br>Christ, the Lord, Amen.” Id., at 98a–99a.&para;<br>Respondents point to other invocations that disparaged&para;<br>those who did not accept the town’s prayer practice. One&para;<br>guest minister characterized objectors as a “minority” who&para;<br>are “ignorant of the history of our country,” id., at 108a,&para;<br>while another lamented that other towns did not have&para;<br>“God-fearing” leaders, id., at 79a. Although these two&para;<br>remarks strayed from the rationale set out in Marsh, they&para;<br>do not despoil a practice that on the whole reflects and&para;<br>embraces our tradition. Absent a pattern of prayers that&para;<br>over time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermissi­&para;<br>ble government purpose, a challenge based solely on the&para;<br>content of a prayer will not likely establish a constitutional&para;<br>violation. Marsh, indeed, requires an inquiry into the&para;<br>prayer opportunity as a whole, rather than into the con­&para;<br>tents of a single prayer. 463 U. S., at 794–795.&para;<br>Finally, the Court disagrees with the view taken by the&para;<br>Court of Appeals that the town of Greece contravened the&para;<br>Establishment Clause by inviting a predominantly Chris­&para;<br>tian set of ministers to lead the prayer. The town made&para;<br>reasonable efforts to identify all of the congregations&para;<br>located within its borders and represented that it would&para;<br>welcome a prayer by any minister or layman who wished&para;<br>to give one. That nearly all of the congregations in town&para;<br>turned out to be Christian does not reflect an aversion or&para;<br>bias on the part of town leaders against minority faiths.&para;<br>So long as the town maintains a policy of nondiscrimina­&para;<br>tion, the Constitution does not require it to search beyond&para;<br>its borders for non-Christian prayer givers in an effort to&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v.

S., at 617&para;<br>(Souter, J., concurring), a form of government entangle­&para;<br>ment with religion that is far more troublesome than the&para;<br>current approach.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Respondents further seek to distinguish the town’s&para;<br>prayer practice from the tradition upheld in Marsh on the&para;<br>ground that it coerces participation by nonadherents.&para;<br>They and some amici contend that prayer conducted in the&para;<br>intimate setting of a town board meeting differs in funda­&para;<br>mental ways from the invocations delivered in Congress&para;<br>and state legislatures, where the public remains segregated&para;<br>from legislative activity and may not address the body&para;<br>except by occasional invitation. Citizens attend town&para;<br>meetings, on the other hand, to accept awards; speak on&para;<br>matters of local importance; and petition the board for&para;<br>action that may affect their economic interests, such as&para;<br>the granting of permits, business licenses, and zoning&para;<br>variances. Respondents argue that the public may feel&para;<br>subtle pressure to participate in prayers that violate their&para;<br>beliefs in order to please the board members from whom&para;<br>they are about to seek a favorable ruling. In their view&para;<br>the fact that board members in small towns know many of&para;<br>their constituents by name only increases the pressure to&para;<br>conform.&para;<br>It is an elemental First Amendment principle that&para;<br>government may not coerce its citizens “to support or&para;<br>participate in any religion or its exercise.” County of&para;<br>Allegheny, 492 U.

The inquiry remains a fact-sensitive&para;<br>one that considers both the setting in which the prayer&para;<br>arises and the audience to whom it is directed.&para;<br>The prayer opportunity in this case must be evaluated&para;<br>against the backdrop of historical practice.

No such thing occurred in the&para;<br>town of Greece. Although board members themselves&para;<br>stood, bowed their heads, or made the sign of the cross&para;<br>during the prayer, they at no point solicited similar ges­&para;<br>tures by the public.

Respondents suggest that constituents&para;<br>might feel pressure to join the prayers to avoid irritating&para;<br>the officials who would be ruling on their petitions, but&para;<br>this argument has no evidentiary support. Nothing in the&para;<br>record indicates that town leaders allocated benefits and&para;<br>burdens based on participation in the prayer, or that&para;<br>citizens were received differently depending on whether&para;<br>they joined the invocation or quietly declined.

It is a moment for town leaders to&para;<br>recognize the achievements of their constituents and the&para;<br>aspects of community life that are worth celebrating. By&para;<br>inviting ministers to serve as chaplain for the month, and&para;<br>welcoming them to the front of the room alongside civic&para;<br>leaders, the town is acknowledging the central place that&para;<br>religion, and religious institutions, hold in the lives of&para;<br>those present.

See&para;<br>App. 31a (thanking a pastor for his “community involve­&para;<br>ment”); id., at 44a (thanking a deacon “for the job that you&para;<br>have done on behalf of our community”). The inclusion of&para;<br>a brief, ceremonial prayer as part of a larger exercise in&para;<br>civic recognition suggests that its purpose and effect are to&para;<br>acknowledge religious leaders and the institutions they&para;<br>represent rather than to exclude or coerce nonbelievers.&para;<br>Ceremonial prayer is but a recognition that, since this&para;<br>Nation was founded and until the present day, many&para;<br>Americans deem that their own existence must be under­&para;<br>stood by precepts far beyond the authority of government&para;<br>to alter or define and that willing participation in civic&para;<br>affairs can be consistent with a brief acknowledgment of&para;<br>their belief in a higher power, always with due respect for&para;<br>those who adhere to other beliefs.

The town decided&para;<br>to emulate a practice long established in Congress and&para;<br>state legislatures by having a brief prayer before sessions&para;<br>of the town board. The task of lining up clergy members&para;<br>willing to provide such a prayer was given to the town’s&para;<br>office of constituent services. 732 F. Supp. 2d 195, 197–&para;<br>198 (WDNY 2010). For the first four years of the practice,&para;<br>a clerical employee in the office would randomly call reli­&para;<br>gious organizations listed in the Greece “Community&para;<br>Guide,” a local directory published by the Greece Chamber&para;<br>of Commerce, until she was able to find somebody willing&para;<br>to give the invocation.

GALLOWAY&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>ally began keeping a list of individuals who had agreed to&para;<br>give the invocation, and when a second clerical employee&para;<br>took over the task of finding prayer-givers, the first em­&para;<br>ployee gave that list to the second. Id., at 198, 199. The&para;<br>second employee then randomly called organizations on&para;<br>that list—and possibly others in the Community Guide—&para;<br>until she found someone who agreed to provide the prayer.&para;<br>Id., at 199.&para;<br>Apparently, all the houses of worship listed in the local&para;<br>Community Guide were Christian churches. Id., at 198–&para;<br>200, 203. That is unsurprising given the small number of&para;<br>non-Christians in the area. Although statistics for the&para;<br>town of Greece alone do not seem to be available, statistics&para;<br>have been compiled for Monroe County, which includes&para;<br>both the town of Greece and the city of Rochester. Accord­&para;<br>ing to these statistics, of the county residents who have a&para;<br>religious affiliation, about 3% are Jewish, and for other&para;<br>non-Christian faiths, the percentages are smaller.1 There&para;<br>are no synagogues within the borders of the town of&para;<br>Greece, id., at 203, but there are several not far away&para;<br>across the Rochester border. Presumably, Jewish resi­&para;<br>dents of the town worship at one or more of those syna­&para;<br>gogues, but because these synagogues fall outside the&para;<br>town’s borders, they were not listed in the town’s local&para;<br>directory, and the responsible town employee did not&para;<br>include them on her list.

According to the&para;<br>principal dissent, the town could have avoided any consti­&para;<br>tutional problem in either of two ways.&para;<br>A&para;<br>First, the principal dissent writes, “[i]f the Town Board&para;<br>had let its chaplains know that they should speak in non­&para;<br>sectarian terms, common to diverse religious groups, then&para;<br>no one would have valid grounds for complaint.” Post, at&para;<br>18–19. “Priests and ministers, rabbis and imams,” the&para;<br>principal dissent continues, “give such invocations all the&para;<br>time” without any great difficulty. Post, at 19.&para;<br>Both Houses of Congress now advise guest chaplains&para;<br>that they should keep in mind that they are addressing&para;<br>members from a variety of faith traditions, and as a mat­&para;<br>ter of policy, this advice has much to recommend it. But&para;<br>any argument that nonsectarian prayer is constitutionally&para;<br>required runs headlong into a long history of contrary&para;<br>congressional practice. From the beginning, as the Court&para;<br>notes, many Christian prayers were offered in the House&para;<br>and Senate, see ante, at 7, and when rabbis and other nonChristian clergy have served as guest chaplains, their&para;<br>prayers have often been couched in terms particular to&para;<br>their faith traditions.3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 For example, when a rabbi first delivered a prayer at a session of&para;<br>the House of Representatives in 1860, he appeared “in full rabbinic&para;<br>dress, ‘piously bedecked in a white tallit and a large velvet skullcap,’ ”&para;<br>and his prayer “invoked several uniquely Jewish themes and repeated&para;<br>the Biblical priestly blessing in Hebrew.” See Brief for Nathan Lewin&para;<br>as Amicus Curiae 9. Many other rabbis have given distinctively Jewish&para;<br>prayers, id., at 10, and n. 3, and distinctively Islamic, Buddhist, and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

It was&para;<br>one thing to compose a prayer that is acceptable to both&para;<br>Christians and Jews; it is much harder to compose a prayer&para;<br>that is also acceptable to followers of Eastern religions&para;<br>that are now well represented in this country. Many local&para;<br>clergy may find the project daunting, if not impossible,&para;<br>and some may feel that they cannot in good faith deliver&para;<br>such a vague prayer.&para;<br>In addition, if a town attempts to go beyond simply&para;<br>recommending that a guest chaplain deliver a prayer that&para;<br>is broadly acceptable to all members of a particular com­&para;<br>munity (and the groups represented in different communi­&para;<br>ties will vary), the town will inevitably encounter sensitive&para;<br>problems. Must a town screen and, if necessary, edit&para;<br>prayers before they are given? If prescreening is not&para;<br>required, must the town review prayers after they are&para;<br>delivered in order to determine if they were sufficiently&para;<br>generic? And if a guest chaplain crosses the line, what&para;<br>must the town do? Must the chaplain be corrected on the&para;<br>spot? Must the town strike this chaplain (and perhaps his&para;<br>or her house of worship) from the approved list?&para;<br>B&para;<br>If a town wants to avoid the problems associated with&para;<br>this first option, the principal dissent argues, it has an­&para;<br>other choice: It may “invit[e] clergy of many faiths.” Post,&para;<br>at 19. “When one month a clergy member refers to Jesus,&para;<br>and the next to Allah or Jehovah,” the principal dissent&para;<br>explains, “the government does not identify itself with one&para;<br>religion or align itself with that faith’s citizens, and the&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>Hindu prayers have also been delivered, see ante, at 10–11. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v.

For that is really&para;<br>the only difference between what the town did and what&para;<br>the principal dissent is willing to accept. The Greece&para;<br>clerical employee drew up her list using the town directory&para;<br>instead of a directory covering the entire greater Roches­&para;<br>ter area. If the task of putting together the list had been&para;<br>handled in a more sophisticated way, the employee in&para;<br>charge would have realized that the town’s Jewish resi­&para;<br>dents attended synagogues on the Rochester side of the&para;<br>border and would have added one or more synagogues to&para;<br>the list. But the mistake was at worst careless, and it was&para;<br>not done with a discriminatory intent. (I would view this&para;<br>case very differently if the omission of these synagogues&para;<br>were intentional.)&para;<br>The informal, imprecise way in which the town lined up&para;<br>guest chaplains is typical of the way in which many things&para;<br>are done in small and medium-sized units of local govern­&para;<br>ment. In such places, the members of the governing body&para;<br>almost always have day jobs that occupy much of their&para;<br>time. The town almost never has a legal office and instead&para;<br>relies for legal advice on a local attorney whose practice is&para;<br>likely to center on such things as land-use regulation,&para;<br>contracts, and torts. When a municipality like the town of&para;<br>Greece seeks in good faith to emulate the congressional&para;<br>practice on which our holding in Marsh v. Chambers, 463&para;<br>U. S. 783 (1983), was largely based, that municipality&para;<br>should not be held to have violated the Constitution sim­&para;<br>ply because its method of recruiting guest chaplains lacks&para;<br>the demographic exactitude that might be regarded as&para;<br>optimal.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>The effect of requiring such exactitude would be to&para;<br>pressure towns to forswear altogether the practice of&para;<br>having a prayer before meetings of the town council.&para;<br>Many local officials, puzzled by our often puzzling Estab­&para;<br>lishment Clause jurisprudence and terrified of the legal&para;<br>fees that may result from a lawsuit claiming a constitu­&para;<br>tional violation, already think that the safest course is to&para;<br>ensure that local government is a religion-free zone.&para;<br>Indeed, the Court of Appeals’ opinion in this case advised&para;<br>towns that constitutional difficulties “may well prompt&para;<br>municipalities to pause and think carefully before adopt­&para;<br>ing legislative prayer.” 681 F. 3d, at 34. But if, as prece­&para;<br>dent and historic practice make clear (and the principal&para;<br>dissent concedes), prayer before a legislative session is not&para;<br>inherently inconsistent with the First Amendment, then a&para;<br>unit of local government should not be held to have violated&para;<br>the First Amendment simply because its procedure for&para;<br>lining up guest chaplains does not comply in all respects&para;<br>with what might be termed a “best practices” standard.&para;<br>III&para;<br>While the principal dissent, in the end, would demand&para;<br>no more than a small modification in the procedure that&para;<br>the town of Greece initially followed, much of the rhetoric&para;<br>in that opinion sweeps more broadly. Indeed, the logical&para;<br>thrust of many of its arguments is that prayer is never&para;<br>permissible prior to meetings of local government legisla­&para;<br>tive bodies. At Greece Town Board meetings, the principal&para;<br>dissent pointedly notes, ordinary citizens (and even chil­&para;<br>dren!) are often present. Post, at 10–11. The guest chap­&para;<br>lains stand in front of the room facing the public. “[T]he&para;<br>setting is intimate,” and ordinary citizens are permitted to&para;<br>speak and to ask the board to address problems that have&para;<br>a direct effect on their lives. Post, at 11. The meetings are&para;<br>“occasions for ordinary citizens to engage with and peti­&para;<br>tion their government, often on highly individualized&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>matters.” Post, at 9. Before a session of this sort, the&para;<br>principal dissent argues, any prayer that is not acceptable&para;<br>to all in attendance is out of bounds.&para;<br>The features of Greece meetings that the principal&para;<br>dissent highlights are by no means unusual.4 It is com­&para;<br>mon for residents to attend such meetings, either to speak&para;<br>on matters on the agenda or to request that the town&para;<br>address other issues that are important to them. Nor is&para;<br>there anything unusual about the occasional attendance of&para;<br>students, and when a prayer is given at the beginning of&para;<br>such a meeting, I expect that the chaplain generally&para;<br>stands at the front of the room and faces the public. To do&para;<br>otherwise would probably be seen by many as rude. Finally, although the principal dissent, post, at 13, attaches&para;<br>importance to the fact that guest chaplains in the town of&para;<br>Greece often began with the words “Let us pray,” that is&para;<br>also commonplace and for many clergy, I suspect, almost&para;<br>reflexive.5 In short, I see nothing out of the ordinary&para;<br>about any of the features that the principal dissent notes.&para;<br>Therefore, if prayer is not allowed at meetings with those&para;<br>characteristics, local government legislative bodies, unlike&para;<br>their national and state counterparts, cannot begin their&para;<br>meetings with a prayer.

S. 132, 150–&para;<br>152 (1925), and this principle has special force when it&para;<br>comes to the interpretation of the Establishment Clause.&para;<br>This Court has always purported to base its Establish­&para;<br>ment Clause decisions on the original meaning of that&para;<br>provision. Thus, in Marsh, when the Court was called&para;<br>upon to decide whether prayer prior to sessions of a state&para;<br>legislature was consistent with the Establishment Clause,&para;<br>we relied heavily on the history of prayer before sessions&para;<br>of Congress and held that a state legislature may follow a&para;<br>similar practice. See 463 U. S., at 786–792.&para;<br>There can be little doubt that the decision in Marsh&para;<br>reflected the original understanding of the First Amend­&para;<br>ment. It is virtually inconceivable that the First Congress,&para;<br>having appointed chaplains whose responsibilities promi­&para;<br>nently included the delivery of prayers at the beginning of&para;<br>each daily session, thought that this practice was incon­&para;<br>sistent with the Establishment Clause. And since this&para;<br>practice was well established and undoubtedly well&para;<br>known, it seems equally clear that the state legislatures&para;<br>that ratified the First Amendment had the same under­&para;<br>standing. In the case before us, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>appeared to base its decision on one of the Establishment&para;<br>Clause “tests” set out in the opinions of this Court, see 681&para;<br>F. 3d, at 26, 30, but if there is any inconsistency between&para;<br>any of those tests and the historic practice of legislative&para;<br>prayer, the inconsistency calls into question the validity of&para;<br>the test, not the historic practice.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

The text of the Clause also suggests that Congress&para;<br>“could not interfere with state establishments, notwithstanding any argument that could be made based on&para;<br>Congress’ power under the Necessary and Proper Clause.”&para;<br>Newdow, supra, at 50 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). The language of the First Amendment (“Congress shall make no&para;<br>law”) “precisely tracked and inverted the exact wording” of&para;<br>the Necessary and Proper Clause (“Congress shall have&para;<br>power . . . to make all laws which shall be necessary and&para;<br>proper . . . ”), which was the subject of fierce criticism by&para;<br>Anti-Federalists at the time of ratification.

Virginia, by contrast, had&para;<br>recently abolished its official state establishment and&para;<br>ended direct government funding of clergy after a legislative battle led by James Madison. See T. Buckley, Church&para;<br>and State in Revolutionary Virginia, 1776–1787, pp. 155–&para;<br>164 (1977).&para;<br>Other States—principally Rhode Island,&para;<br>Pennsylvania, and Delaware, which were founded by&para;<br>religious dissenters—had no history of formal establishments at all, although they still maintained religious tests&para;<br>for office. See McConnell, The Origins and Historical&para;<br>Understanding of Free Exercise of Religion, 103 Harv.&para;<br>L. Rev. 1409, 1425–1426, 1430 (1990).&para;<br>The import of this history is that the relationship between church and state in the fledgling Republic was far&para;<br>from settled at the time of ratification. See Muñoz, The&para;<br>Original Meaning of the Establishment Clause and the&para;<br>Impossibility of Its Incorporation, 8 U. Pa. J. Constitutional L. 585, 605 (2006). Although the remaining state&para;<br>establishments were ultimately dismantled—Massachusetts,&para;<br>the last State to disestablish, would do so in 1833, see Levy&para;<br>42—that outcome was far from assured when the Bill of&para;<br>Rights was ratified in 1791. That lack of consensus suggests that the First Amendment was simply agnostic on&para;<br>the subject of state establishments; the decision to establish or disestablish religion was reserved to the States.&para;<br>Amar 41.&para;<br>The Federalist logic of the original Establishment&para;<br>Clause poses a special barrier to its mechanical incorporation against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. See id., at 33. Unlike the Free Exercise Clause,&para;<br>which “plainly protects individuals against congressional&para;<br>interference with the right to exercise their religion,” the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY&para;<br>Opinion of THOMAS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Establishment Clause “does not purport to protect individual rights.” Newdow, 542 U. S., at 50 (opinion of&para;<br>THOMAS, J.). Instead, the States are the particular beneficiaries of the Clause. Incorporation therefore gives rise to&para;<br>a paradoxical result: Applying the Clause against the&para;<br>States eliminates their right to establish a religion free&para;<br>from federal interference, thereby “prohibit[ing] exactly&para;<br>what the Establishment Clause protected.” Id., at 51; see&para;<br>Amar 33–34.&para;<br>Put differently, the structural reasons that counsel&para;<br>against incorporating the Tenth Amendment also apply to&para;<br>the Establishment Clause. Id., at 34. To my knowledge,&para;<br>no court has ever suggested that the Tenth Amendment,&para;<br>which “reserve[s] to the States” powers not delegated to&para;<br>the Federal Government, could or should be applied&para;<br>against the States. To incorporate that limitation would&para;<br>be to divest the States of all powers not specifically delegated to them, thereby inverting the original import of the&para;<br>Amendment. Incorporating the Establishment Clause has&para;<br>precisely the same effect.&para;<br>The most cogent argument in favor of incorporation may&para;<br>be that, by the time of Reconstruction, the framers of the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment had come to reinterpret the Establishment Clause (notwithstanding its Federalist origins) as expressing an individual right. On this question,&para;<br>historical evidence from the 1860’s is mixed. Congressmen&para;<br>who catalogued the personal rights protected by the First&para;<br>Amendment commonly referred to speech, press, petition,&para;<br>and assembly, but not to a personal right of nonestablishment; instead, they spoke only of “ ‘free exercise’ ” or&para;<br>“ ‘freedom of conscience.’ ” Amar 253, and 385, n. 91 (collecting sources). There may be reason to think these lists&para;<br>were abbreviated, and silence on the issue is not dispositive. See Lash, The Second Adoption of the Establishment&para;<br>Clause: The Rise of the Nonestablishment Principle, 27&para;<br>Ariz. St. L. J. 1085, 1141–1145 (1995); but cf. S.

Given the&para;<br>textual and logical difficulties posed by incorporation,&para;<br>however, there is no warrant for transforming the meaning of the Establishment Clause without a firm historical&para;<br>foundation.&para;<br>See Newdow, supra, at 51 (opinion of&para;<br>THOMAS, J.). The burden of persuasion therefore rests&para;<br>with those who claim that the Clause assumed a different&para;<br>meaning upon adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.1&para;<br>II&para;<br>Even if the Establishment Clause were properly incorporated against the States, the municipal prayers at issue&para;<br>in this case bear no resemblance to the coercive state&para;<br>establishments that existed at the founding. “The coercion&para;<br>that was a hallmark of historical establishments of religion was coercion of religious orthodoxy and of financial&para;<br>support by force of law and threat of penalty.” Lee v.&para;<br>Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 640 (1992) (SCALIA, J., dissent——————&para;<br>1 This Court has never squarely addressed these barriers to the incorporation of the Establishment Clause. When the issue was first&para;<br>presented in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947), the&para;<br>Court casually asserted that “the Fourteenth Amendment [has been]&para;<br>interpreted to make the prohibitions of the First applicable to state&para;<br>action abridging religious freedom. There is every reason to give the&para;<br>same application and broad interpretation to the ‘establishment of&para;<br>religion’ clause.” Id., at 15 (footnote omitted). The cases the Court&para;<br>cited in support of that proposition involved the Free Exercise Clause—&para;<br>which had been incorporated seven years earlier, in Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 303 (1940)—not the Establishment Clause. 330&para;<br>U. S., at 15, n. 22 (collecting cases). Thus, in the space of a single&para;<br>paragraph and a nonresponsive string citation, the Everson Court glibly&para;<br>effected a sea change in constitutional law. The Court’s inattention to&para;<br>these doctrinal questions might be explained, although not excused, by&para;<br>the rise of popular conceptions about “separation of church and state”&para;<br>as an “American” constitutional right.

See supra, at 2–3.&para;<br>Notwithstanding these variations, both state and local&para;<br>forms of establishment involved “actual legal coercion,”&para;<br>Newdow, supra, at 52 (opinion of THOMAS, J.): They exercised government power in order to exact financial support&para;<br>of the church, compel religious observance, or control&para;<br>religious doctrine.&para;<br>None of these founding-era state establishments remained at the time of Reconstruction. But even assuming&para;<br>that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment reconceived the nature of the Establishment Clause as a constraint on the States, nothing in the history of the intervening period suggests a fundamental transformation in&para;<br>their understanding of what constituted an establishment.&para;<br>At a minimum, there is no support for the proposition that&para;<br>the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment embraced&para;<br>wholly modern notions that the Establishment Clause is&para;<br>violated whenever the “reasonable observer” feels “subtle&para;<br>pressure,” ante, at 18, 19, or perceives governmental “endors[ement],” ante, at 5–6.

Moreover, the&para;<br>state constitutional provisions that prohibited religious&para;<br>“comp[ulsion]” made clear that the relevant sort of compulsion was legal in nature, of the same type that had&para;<br>characterized founding-era establishments.2 These provisions strongly suggest that, whatever nonestablishment&para;<br>principles existed in 1868, they included no concern for the&para;<br>finer sensibilities of the “reasonable observer.”&para;<br>Thus, to the extent coercion is relevant to the Establishment Clause analysis, it is actual legal coercion that&para;<br>counts—not the “subtle coercive pressures” allegedly felt&para;<br>by respondents in this case, ante, at 9.

It also took&para;<br>into account related “actions (and inactions) of prayergivers and town officials.” Ibid. Those actions and inactions included (1) a selection process that led to the selection of “clergy almost exclusively from places of worship&para;<br>located within the town’s borders,” despite the likelihood&para;<br>that significant numbers of town residents were members&para;<br>of congregations that gather just outside those borders; (2)&para;<br>a failure to “infor[m] members of the general public that&para;<br>volunteers” would be acceptable prayer givers; and (3) a&para;<br>failure to “infor[m] prayer-givers that invocations were not&para;<br>to be exploited as an effort to convert others to the particular faith of the invocational speaker, nor to disparage&para;<br>any faith or belief different than that of the invoca-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tional speaker.” Id., at 31–32 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals further emphasized what it was&para;<br>not holding. It did not hold that “the town may not open&para;<br>its public meetings with a prayer,” or that “any prayers&para;<br>offered in this context must be blandly ‘nonsectarian.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at 33. In essence, the Court of Appeals merely held&para;<br>that the town must do more than it had previously done to&para;<br>try to make its prayer practices inclusive of other faiths.&para;<br>And it did not prescribe a single constitutionally required&para;<br>method for doing so.&para;<br>In my view, the Court of Appeals’ conclusion and its&para;<br>reasoning are convincing. JUSTICE KAGAN’s dissent is&para;<br>consistent with that view, and I join it. I also here emphasize several factors that I believe underlie the conclusion&para;<br>that, on the particular facts of this case, the town’s prayer&para;<br>practice violated the Establishment Clause.&para;<br>First, Greece is a predominantly Christian town, but it&para;<br>is not exclusively so. A map of the town’s houses of worship introduced in the District Court shows many Christian churches within the town’s limits. It also shows a&para;<br>Buddhist temple within the town and several Jewish&para;<br>synagogues just outside its borders, in the adjacent city of&para;<br>Rochester, New York. Id., at 24. Yet during the more&para;<br>than 120 monthly meetings at which prayers were delivered during the record period (from 1999 to 2010), only&para;<br>four prayers were delivered by non-Christians. And all of&para;<br>these occurred in 2008, shortly after the plaintiffs began&para;<br>complaining about the town’s Christian prayer practice&para;<br>and nearly a decade after that practice had commenced.&para;<br>See post, at 14, 21.&para;<br>To be precise: During 2008, two prayers were delivered&para;<br>by a Jewish layman, one by the chairman of a Baha’i&para;<br>congregation, and one by a Wiccan priestess. The Jewish&para;<br>and Wiccan prayer givers were invited only after they&para;<br>reached out to the town to inquire about giving an invoca-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tion. The town apparently invited the Baha’i chairman on&para;<br>its own initiative. The inclusivity of the 2008 meetings,&para;<br>which contrasts starkly with the exclusively singledenomination prayers every year before and after, is&para;<br>commendable. But the Court of Appeals reasonably decided not to give controlling weight to that inclusivity, for it&para;<br>arose only in response to the complaints that presaged this&para;<br>litigation, and it did not continue into the following years.&para;<br>Second, the town made no significant effort to inform&para;<br>the area’s non-Christian houses of worship about the&para;<br>possibility of delivering an opening prayer. See post, at&para;<br>21. Beginning in 1999, when it instituted its practice of&para;<br>opening its monthly board meetings with prayer, Greece&para;<br>selected prayer givers as follows: Initially, the town’s&para;<br>employees invited clergy from each religious organization&para;<br>listed in a “Community Guide” published by the Greece&para;<br>Chamber of Commerce. After that, the town kept a list of&para;<br>clergy who had accepted invitations and reinvited those&para;<br>clergy to give prayers at future meetings. From time to&para;<br>time, the town supplemented this list in response to requests from citizens and to new additions to the Community Guide and a town newspaper called the Greece Post.&para;<br>The plaintiffs do not argue that the town intentionally&para;<br>discriminated against non-Christians when choosing&para;<br>whom to invite, 681 F. 3d, at 26, and the town claims,&para;<br>plausibly, that it would have allowed anyone who asked to&para;<br>give an invocation to do so. Rather, the evident reasons&para;<br>why the town consistently chose Christian prayer givers&para;<br>are that the Buddhist and Jewish temples mentioned&para;<br>above were not listed in the Community Guide or the&para;<br>Greece Post and that the town limited its list of clergy&para;<br>almost exclusively to representatives of houses of worship&para;<br>situated within Greece’s town limits (again, the Buddhist&para;<br>temple on the map was within those limits, but the synagogues were just outside them). Id., at 24, 31.&para;<br>Third, in this context, the fact that nearly all of the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>prayers given reflected a single denomination takes on&para;<br>significance. That significance would have been the same&para;<br>had all the prayers been Jewish, or Hindu, or Buddhist, or&para;<br>of any other denomination. The significance is that, in a&para;<br>context where religious minorities exist and where more&para;<br>could easily have been done to include their participation,&para;<br>the town chose to do nothing. It could, for example, have&para;<br>posted its policy of permitting anyone to give an invocation&para;<br>on its website, greeceny.gov, which provides dates and&para;<br>times of upcoming town board meetings along with&para;<br>minutes of prior meetings. It could have announced inclusive policies at the beginning of its board meetings, just&para;<br>before introducing the month’s prayer giver. It could have&para;<br>provided information to those houses of worship of all&para;<br>faiths that lie just outside its borders and include citizens&para;<br>of Greece among their members. Given that the town&para;<br>could easily have made these or similar efforts but chose&para;<br>not to, the fact that all of the prayers (aside from the 2008&para;<br>outliers) were given by adherents of a single religion reflects a lack of effort to include others. And that is what I&para;<br>take to be a major point of JUSTICE KAGAN’s related discussion. See post, at 2–4, 9, 14–15, 21–23.&para;<br>Fourth, the fact that the board meeting audience included citizens with business to conduct also contributes&para;<br>to the importance of making more of an effort to include&para;<br>members of other denominations. It does not, however,&para;<br>automatically change the nature of the meeting from one&para;<br>where an opening prayer is permissible under the Establishment Clause to one where it is not. Cf. post, at 8–14,&para;<br>16–17, 20.&para;<br>Fifth, it is not normally government’s place to rewrite,&para;<br>to parse, or to critique the language of particular prayers.&para;<br>And it is always possible that members of one religious&para;<br>group will find that prayers of other groups (or perhaps&para;<br>even a moment of silence) are not compatible with their&para;<br>faith. Despite this risk, the Constitution does not forbid&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>opening prayers. But neither does the Constitution forbid&para;<br>efforts to explain to those who give the prayers the nature&para;<br>of the occasion and the audience.&para;<br>The U. S. House of Representatives, for example, provides its guest chaplains with the following guidelines,&para;<br>which are designed to encourage the sorts of prayer that&para;<br>are consistent with the purpose of an invocation for a&para;<br>government body in a religiously pluralistic Nation:&para;<br>“The guest chaplain should keep in mind that the&para;<br>House of Representatives is comprised of Members of&para;<br>many different faith traditions.&para;<br>“The length of the prayer should not exceed 150&para;<br>words.&para;<br>“The prayer must be free from personal political views&para;<br>or partisan politics, from sectarian controversies, and&para;<br>from any intimations pertaining to foreign or domestic&para;<br>policy.” App. to Brief for Respondents 2a.&para;<br>The town made no effort to promote a similarly inclusive&para;<br>prayer practice here. See post, at 21–22.&para;<br>As both the Court and JUSTICE KAGAN point out, we are&para;<br>a Nation of many religions. Ante, at 10–11; post, at 1–2,&para;<br>18.

The question in this case is&para;<br>whether the prayer practice of the town of Greece, by&para;<br>doing too little to reflect the religious diversity of its citizens, did too much, even if unintentionally, to promote the&para;<br>“political division along religious lines” that “was one of&para;<br>the principal evils against which the First Amendment&para;<br>was intended to protect.” Lemon v.

Having applied my&para;<br>legal judgment to the relevant facts, I conclude, like&para;<br>JUSTICE KAGAN, that the town of Greece failed to make&para;<br>reasonable efforts to include prayer givers of minority&para;<br>faiths, with the result that, although it is a community of&para;<br>several faiths, its prayer givers were almost exclusively&para;<br>persons of a single faith. Under these circumstances, I&para;<br>would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals that&para;<br>Greece’s prayer practice violated the Establishment&para;<br>Clause.&para;<br>I dissent from the Court’s decision to the contrary.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Our Constitution promises that they&para;<br>may worship in their own way, without fear of penalty or&para;<br>danger, and that in itself is a momentous offering. Yet our&para;<br>Constitution makes a commitment still more remarkable—&para;<br>that however those individuals worship, they will count&para;<br>as full and equal American citizens. A Christian, a Jew,&para;<br>a Muslim (and so forth)—each stands in the same re­&para;<br>lationship with her country, with her state and local&para;<br>communities, and with every level and body of govern­&para;<br>ment. So that when each person performs the duties or&para;<br>seeks the benefits of citizenship, she does so not as an&para;<br>adherent to one or another religion, but simply as an&para;<br>American.&para;<br>I respectfully dissent from the Court’s opinion because I&para;<br>think the Town of Greece’s prayer practices violate that&para;<br>norm of religious equality—the breathtakingly generous&para;<br>constitutional idea that our public institutions belong no&para;<br>less to the Buddhist or Hindu than to the Methodist or&para;<br>Episcopalian. I do not contend that principle translates&para;<br>here into a bright separationist line. To the contrary, I&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>agree with the Court’s decision in Marsh v. Chambers, 463&para;<br>U. S. 783 (1983), upholding the Nebraska Legislature’s tra­&para;<br>dition of beginning each session with a chaplain’s prayer.&para;<br>And I believe that pluralism and inclusion in a town hall&para;<br>can satisfy the constitutional requirement of neutrality;&para;<br>such a forum need not become a religion-free zone. But&para;<br>still, the Town of Greece should lose this case. The prac­&para;<br>tice at issue here differs from the one sustained in Marsh&para;<br>because Greece’s town meetings involve participation by&para;<br>ordinary citizens, and the invocations given—directly to&para;<br>those citizens—were predominantly sectarian in content.&para;<br>Still more, Greece’s Board did nothing to recognize reli­&para;<br>gious diversity: In arranging for clergy members to open&para;<br>each meeting, the Town never sought (except briefly when&para;<br>this suit was filed) to involve, accommodate, or in any way&para;<br>reach out to adherents of non-Christian religions. So&para;<br>month in and month out for over a decade, prayers steeped&para;<br>in only one faith, addressed toward members of the public,&para;<br>commenced meetings to discuss local affairs and distribute&para;<br>government benefits. In my view, that practice does not&para;<br>square with the First Amendment’s promise that every&para;<br>citizen, irrespective of her religion, owns an equal share in&para;<br>her government.&para;<br>I&para;<br>To begin to see what has gone wrong in the Town of&para;<br>Greece, consider several hypothetical scenarios in which&para;<br>sectarian prayer—taken straight from this case’s record—&para;<br>infuses governmental activities. None involves, as this&para;<br>case does, a proceeding that could be characterized as a&para;<br>legislative session, but they are useful to elaborate some&para;<br>general principles. In each instance, assume (as was true&para;<br>in Greece) that the invocation is given pursuant to gov­&para;<br>ernment policy and is representative of the prayers gener­&para;<br>ally offered in the designated setting:&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

The judge bangs his gavel&para;<br>to call the court to order, asks a minister to come to&para;<br>the front of the room, and instructs the 10 or so in­&para;<br>dividuals present to rise for an opening prayer.&para;<br>The clergyman faces those in attendance and says:&para;<br>“Lord, God of all creation, . . . . We acknowledge&para;<br>the saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross.&para;<br>We draw strength . . . from his resurrection at&para;<br>Easter.

I have every confidence the Court&para;<br>would agree. See ante, at 13 (ALITO, J., concurring). And&para;<br>even Greece’s attorney conceded that something like the&para;<br>first hypothetical (he was not asked about the others)&para;<br>would violate the First Amendment. See Tr. of Oral Arg.&para;<br>3–4. Why?&para;<br>The reason, of course, has nothing to do with Christian­&para;<br>ity as such. This opinion is full of Christian prayers, be­&para;<br>cause those were the only invocations offered in the Town&para;<br>of Greece. But if my hypotheticals involved the prayer of&para;<br>some other religion, the outcome would be exactly the&para;<br>same. Suppose, for example, that government officials in&para;<br>a predominantly Jewish community asked a rabbi to begin&para;<br>all public functions with a chanting of the Sh’ma and&para;<br>V’ahavta. (“Hear O Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is&para;<br>One. . . . Bind [these words] as a sign upon your hand; let&para;<br>them be a symbol before your eyes; inscribe them on the&para;<br>doorposts of your house, and on your gates.”) Or assume&para;<br>officials in a mostly Muslim town requested a muezzin to&para;<br>commence such functions, over and over again, with a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

I bear wit­&para;<br>ness that Muhammed is the Messenger of God.”) In any&para;<br>instance, the question would be why such government­&para;<br>sponsored prayer of a single religion goes beyond the&para;<br>constitutional pale.&para;<br>One glaring problem is that the government in all these&para;<br>hypotheticals has aligned itself with, and placed its im­&para;<br>primatur on, a particular religious creed. “The clearest&para;<br>command of the Establishment Clause,” this Court has&para;<br>held, “is that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another.” Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S.&para;<br>228, 244 (1982). Justices have often differed about a&para;<br>further issue: whether and how the Clause applies to&para;<br>governmental policies favoring religion (of all kinds) over&para;<br>non-religion. Compare, e.g., McCreary County v. American&para;<br>Civil Liberties Union of Ky., 545 U.

Perhaps she feels sufficient pressure to go along—to rise, bow her head, and join&para;<br>in whatever others are saying: After all, she wants,&para;<br>very badly, what the judge or poll worker or immigration&para;<br>official has to offer. Or perhaps she is made of stronger&para;<br>mettle, and she opts not to participate in what she does not&para;<br>believe—indeed, what would, for her, be something like&para;<br>blasphemy. She then must make known her dissent from&para;<br>the common religious view, and place herself apart from&para;<br>other citizens, as well as from the officials responsible for&para;<br>the invocations. And so a civic function of some kind&para;<br>brings religious differences to the fore: That public pro­&para;<br>ceeding becomes (whether intentionally or not) an instru­&para;<br>ment for dividing her from adherents to the community’s&para;<br>majority religion, and for altering the very nature of her&para;<br>relationship with her government.&para;<br>That is not the country we are, because that is not what&para;<br>our Constitution permits. Here, when a citizen stands&para;<br>before her government, whether to perform a service or&para;<br>request a benefit, her religious beliefs do not enter into the&para;<br>picture. See Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Act for Establish­&para;<br>ing Religious Freedom (Oct. 31, 1785), in 5 The Founders’&para;<br>Constitution 85 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987)&para;<br>(“[O]pinion[s] in matters of religion . . . shall in no wise&para;<br>diminish, enlarge, or affect [our] civil capacities”). The&para;<br>government she faces favors no particular religion, either&para;<br>by word or by deed. And that government, in its various&para;<br>processes and proceedings, imposes no religious tests on&para;<br>its citizens, sorts none of them by faith, and permits no&para;<br>exclusion based on belief. When a person goes to court, a&para;<br>polling place, or an immigration proceeding—I could go on:&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>to a zoning agency, a parole board hearing, or the DMV—&para;<br>government officials do not engage in sectarian worship,&para;<br>nor do they ask her to do likewise. They all participate in&para;<br>the business of government not as Christians, Jews, Mus­&para;<br>lims (and more), but only as Americans—none of them&para;<br>different from any other for that civic purpose. Why not,&para;<br>then, at a town meeting?&para;<br>II&para;<br>In both Greece’s and the majority’s view, everything I&para;<br>have discussed is irrelevant here because this case in­&para;<br>volves “the tradition of legislative prayer outlined” in&para;<br>Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783. Ante, at 10. And&para;<br>before I dispute the Town and Court, I want to give them&para;<br>their due: They are right that, under Marsh, legislative&para;<br>prayer has a distinctive constitutional warrant by virtue of&para;<br>tradition. As the Court today describes, a long history,&para;<br>stretching back to the first session of Congress (when&para;<br>chaplains began to give prayers in both Chambers), “ha[s]&para;<br>shown that prayer in this limited context could ‘coexis[t]&para;<br>with the principles of disestablishment and religious&para;<br>freedom.’ ” Ante, at 10 (quoting Marsh, 463 U. S., at 786).&para;<br>Relying on that “unbroken” national tradition, Marsh&para;<br>upheld (I think correctly) the Nebraska Legislature’s&para;<br>practice of opening each day with a chaplain’s prayer as “a&para;<br>tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among&para;<br>the people of this country.” Id., at 792. And so I agree&para;<br>with the majority that the issue here is “whether the&para;<br>prayer practice in the Town of Greece fits within the tradi­&para;<br>tion long followed in Congress and the state legislatures.”&para;<br>Ante, at 9.&para;<br>Where I depart from the majority is in my reply to that&para;<br>question. The town hall here is a kind of hybrid. Greece’s&para;<br>Board indeed has legislative functions, as Congress and&para;<br>state assemblies do—and that means some opening pray­&para;<br>ers are allowed there. But much as in my hypotheticals,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the Board’s meetings are also occasions for ordinary citi­&para;<br>zens to engage with and petition their government, often&para;<br>on highly individualized matters. That feature calls for&para;<br>Board members to exercise special care to ensure that the&para;<br>prayers offered are inclusive—that they respect each and&para;<br>every member of the community as an equal citizen.2 But&para;<br>the Board, and the clergy members it selected, made no&para;<br>such effort. Instead, the prayers given in Greece, ad­&para;<br>dressed directly to the Town’s citizenry, were more sec­&para;<br>tarian, and less inclusive, than anything this Court sus­&para;<br>tained in Marsh. For those reasons, the prayer in Greece&para;<br>departs from the legislative tradition that the majority&para;<br>takes as its benchmark.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Start by comparing two pictures, drawn precisely from&para;<br>reality. The first is of Nebraska’s (unicameral) Legisla­&para;<br>ture, as this Court and the state senators themselves&para;<br>described it. The second is of town council meetings in&para;<br>Greece, as revealed in this case’s record.&para;<br>It is morning in Nebraska, and senators are beginning&para;<br>to gather in the State’s legislative chamber: It is the be­&para;<br>ginning of the official workday, although senators may not&para;<br>yet need to be on the floor. See Chambers v. Marsh, 504&para;<br>F. Supp. 585, 590, and n. 12 (D. Neb. 1980); Lee, 505 U. S.,&para;<br>at 597. The chaplain rises to give the daily invocation.&para;<br>That prayer, as the senators emphasized when their case&para;<br>came to this Court, is “directed only at the legislative&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Because&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO questions this point, it bears repeating. I do&para;<br>not remotely contend that “prayer is not allowed” at participatory&para;<br>meetings of “local government legislative bodies”; nor is that the&para;<br>“logical thrust” of any argument I make. Ante, at 7–8. Rather, what I&para;<br>say throughout this opinion is that in this citizen-centered venue,&para;<br>government officials must take steps to ensure—as none of Greece’s&para;<br>Board members ever did—that opening prayers are inclusive of differ­&para;<br>ent faiths, rather than always identified with a single religion.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v.

Any members of the public who&para;<br>happen to be in attendance—not very many at this early&para;<br>hour—watch only from the upstairs visitors’ gallery. See&para;<br>App. 72 in Marsh (senator’s testimony that “as a practical&para;<br>matter the public usually is not there” during the prayer).&para;<br>The longtime chaplain says something like the following&para;<br>(the excerpt is from his own amicus brief supporting&para;<br>Greece in this case): “O God, who has given all persons&para;<br>talents and varying capacities, Thou dost only require of&para;<br>us that we utilize Thy gifts to a maximum.

The&para;<br>chaplain is a Presbyterian minister, and “some of his&para;<br>earlier prayers” explicitly invoked Christian beliefs, but he&para;<br>“removed all references to Christ” after a single legislator&para;<br>complained. Marsh, 463 U. S., at 793, n. 14; Brief for&para;<br>Petitioners in Marsh 12. The chaplain also previously&para;<br>invited other clergy members to give the invocation, in­&para;<br>cluding local rabbis. See ibid.&para;<br>Now change the channel: It is evening in Greece, New&para;<br>York, and the Supervisor of the Town Board calls its&para;<br>monthly public meeting to order. Those meetings (so says&para;<br>the Board itself) are “the most important part of Town&para;<br>government.” See Town of Greece, Town Board, online at&para;<br>http://greeceny.gov/planning/townboard (as visited May 2,&para;<br>2014 and available in Clerk of Court’s case file). They&para;<br>serve assorted functions, almost all actively involving&para;<br>members of the public. The Board may swear in new&para;<br>Town employees and hand out awards for civic accom­&para;<br>plishments; it always provides an opportunity (called a&para;<br>Public Forum) for citizens to address local issues and ask&para;<br>for improved services or new policies (for example, better&para;<br>accommodations for the disabled or actions to ameliorate&para;<br>traffic congestion, see Pl.

But the setting is intimate: There are&para;<br>likely to be only 10 or so citizens in attendance. A few&para;<br>may be children or teenagers, present to receive an award&para;<br>or fulfill a high school civics requirement.&para;<br>As the first order of business, the Town Supervisor&para;<br>introduces a local Christian clergy member—denominated&para;<br>the chaplain of the month—to lead the assembled persons&para;<br>in prayer. The pastor steps up to a lectern (emblazoned&para;<br>with the Town’s seal) at the front of the dais, and with his&para;<br>back to the Town officials, he faces the citizens present.&para;<br>He asks them all to stand and to “pray as we begin this&para;<br>evening’s town meeting.” App. 134a. (He does not suggest&para;<br>that anyone should feel free not to participate.) And he&para;<br>says:&para;<br>“The beauties of spring . . . are an expressive symbol&para;<br>of the new life of the risen Christ. The Holy Spirit&para;<br>was sent to the apostles at Pentecost so that they&para;<br>would be courageous witnesses of the Good News to&para;<br>different regions of the Mediterranean world and be­&para;<br>yond. The Holy Spirit continues to be the inspiration&para;<br>and the source of strength and virtue, which we all&para;<br>need in the world of today. And so . . . [w]e pray this&para;<br>evening for the guidance of the Holy Spirit as the&para;<br>Greece Town Board meets.” Ibid.&para;<br>After the pastor concludes, Town officials behind him&para;<br>make the sign of the cross, as do some members of the&para;<br>audience, and everyone says “Amen.” See 681 F. 3d 20, 24&para;<br>(CA2 2012). The Supervisor then announces the start of&para;<br>the Public Forum, and a citizen stands up to complain&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>about the Town’s contract with a cable company. See App.&para;<br>in No. 10–3635 (CA2), p. A574.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Let’s count the ways in which these pictures diverge.&para;<br>First, the governmental proceedings at which the prayers&para;<br>occur differ significantly in nature and purpose. The&para;<br>Nebraska Legislature’s floor sessions—like those of the&para;<br>U. S. Congress and other state assemblies—are of, by, and&para;<br>for elected lawmakers. Members of the public take no part&para;<br>in those proceedings; any few who attend are spectators&para;<br>only, watching from a high-up visitors’ gallery. (In that&para;<br>respect, note that neither the Nebraska Legislature nor&para;<br>the Congress calls for prayer when citizens themselves&para;<br>participate in a hearing—say, by giving testimony rele­&para;<br>vant to a bill or nomination.) Greece’s town meetings, by&para;<br>contrast, revolve around ordinary members of the commu­&para;<br>nity. Each and every aspect of those sessions provides&para;<br>opportunities for Town residents to interact with public&para;<br>officials. And the most important parts enable those&para;<br>citizens to petition their government. In the Public Fo­&para;<br>rum, they urge (or oppose) changes in the Board’s policies&para;<br>and priorities; and then, in what are essentially adjudica­&para;<br>tory hearings, they request the Board to grant (or deny)&para;<br>applications for various permits, licenses, and zoning&para;<br>variances. So the meetings, both by design and in opera­&para;<br>tion, allow citizens to actively participate in the Town’s&para;<br>governance—sharing concerns, airing grievances, and&para;<br>both shaping the community’s policies and seeking their&para;<br>benefits.&para;<br>Second (and following from what I just said), the pray­&para;<br>ers in these two settings have different audiences. In the&para;<br>Nebraska Legislature, the chaplain spoke to, and only to,&para;<br>the elected representatives. Nebraska’s senators were&para;<br>adamant on that point in briefing Marsh, and the facts&para;<br>fully supported them: As the senators stated, “[t]he activ­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ity is a matter of internal daily procedure directed only at&para;<br>the legislative membership, not at [members of] the pub­&para;<br>lic.” Brief for Petitioners in Marsh 30; see Reply Brief for&para;<br>Petitioners in Marsh 8 (“The [prayer] practice involves no&para;<br>function or power of government vis-à-vis the Nebraska&para;<br>citizenry, but merely concerns an internal decision of the&para;<br>Nebraska Legislature as to the daily procedure by which it&para;<br>conducts its own affairs”). The same is true in the U. S.&para;<br>Congress and, I suspect, in every other state legislature.&para;<br>See Brief for Members of Congress as Amici Curiae 6&para;<br>(“Consistent with the fact that attending citizens are mere&para;<br>passive observers, prayers in the House are delivered for&para;<br>the Representatives themselves, not those citizens”). As&para;<br>several Justices later noted (and the majority today&para;<br>agrees, see ante, at 19–20),3 Marsh involved “government&para;<br>officials invok[ing] spiritual inspiration entirely for their&para;<br>own benefit without directing any religious message at the&para;<br>citizens they lead.” Lee, 505 U. S., at 630, n. 8 (Souter, J.,&para;<br>concurring).&para;<br>The very opposite is true in Greece: Contrary to the&para;<br>majority’s characterization, see ante, at 19–20, the prayers&para;<br>there are directed squarely at the citizens. Remember&para;<br>that the chaplain of the month stands with his back to the&para;<br>Town Board; his real audience is the group he is facing—&para;<br>the 10 or so members of the public, perhaps including&para;<br>children. See supra, at 10. And he typically addresses&para;<br>those people, as even the majority observes, as though he&para;<br>is “directing [his] congregation.” Ante, at 21. He almost&para;<br>always begins with some version of “Let us all pray to­&para;<br>gether.” See, e.g., App. 75a, 93a, 106a, 109a. Often, he&para;<br>calls on everyone to stand and bow their heads, and he&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 For&para;<br>&para;<br>ease of reference and to avoid confusion, I refer to JUSTICE&para;<br>KENNEDY’s opinion as “the majority.” But the language I cite that&para;<br>appears in Part II–B of that opinion is, in fact, only attributable to a&para;<br>plurality of the Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>may ask them to recite a common prayer with him. See,&para;<br>e.g., id., at 28a, 42a, 43a, 56a, 77a. He refers, constantly,&para;<br>to a collective “we”—to “our” savior, for example, to the&para;<br>presence of the Holy Spirit in “our” lives, or to “our brother&para;<br>the Lord Jesus Christ.” See, e.g., id., at 32a, 45a, 47a, 69a,&para;<br>71a. In essence, the chaplain leads, as the first part of a&para;<br>town meeting, a highly intimate (albeit relatively brief)&para;<br>prayer service, with the public serving as his congregation.&para;<br>And third, the prayers themselves differ in their content&para;<br>and character. Marsh characterized the prayers in the&para;<br>Nebraska Legislature as “in the Judeo-Christian tradi­&para;<br>tion,” and stated, as a relevant (even if not dispositive)&para;<br>part of its analysis, that the chaplain had removed all&para;<br>explicitly Christian references at a senator’s request. 463&para;<br>U. S., at 793, n. 14. And as the majority acknowledges,&para;<br>see ante, at 12, Marsh hinged on the view that “that the&para;<br>prayer opportunity ha[d] [not] been exploited to proselyt­&para;<br>ize or advance any one . . . faith or belief ”; had it been&para;<br>otherwise, the Court would have reached a different deci­&para;<br>sion. 463 U. S., at 794–795.&para;<br>But no one can fairly read the prayers from Greece’s&para;<br>Town meetings as anything other than explicitly Chris­&para;<br>tian—constantly and exclusively so. From the time Greece&para;<br>established its prayer practice in 1999 until litigation&para;<br>loomed nine years later, all of its monthly chaplains were&para;<br>Christian clergy. And after a brief spell surrounding the&para;<br>filing of this suit (when a Jewish layman, a Wiccan priest­&para;<br>ess, and a Baha’i minister appeared at meetings), the&para;<br>Town resumed its practice of inviting only clergy from&para;<br>neighboring Protestant and Catholic churches. See App.&para;<br>129a–143a. About two-thirds of the prayers given over&para;<br>this decade or so invoked “Jesus,” “Christ,” “Your Son,” or&para;<br>“the Holy Spirit”; in the 18 months before the record&para;<br>closed, 85% included those references. See generally id.,&para;<br>at 27a–143a. Many prayers contained elaborations of&para;<br>Christian doctrine or recitations of scripture. See, e.g., id.,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>at 129a (“And in the life and death, resurrection and&para;<br>ascension of the Savior Jesus Christ, the full extent of&para;<br>your kindness shown to the unworthy is forever demon­&para;<br>strated”); id., at 94a (“For unto us a child is born; unto us&para;<br>a son is given. And the government shall be upon his&para;<br>shoulder . . .”). And the prayers usually close with phrases&para;<br>like “in the name of Jesus Christ” or “in the name of Your&para;<br>son.” See, e.g., id., at 55a, 65a, 73a, 85a.&para;<br>Still more, the prayers betray no understanding that the&para;<br>American community is today, as it long has been, a rich&para;<br>mosaic of religious faiths. See Braunfeld v. Brown, 366&para;<br>U. S. 599, 606 (1961) (plurality opinion) (recognizing even&para;<br>half a century ago that “we are a cosmopolitan nation&para;<br>made up of people of almost every conceivable religious&para;<br>preference”). The monthly chaplains appear almost al­&para;<br>ways to assume that everyone in the room is Christian&para;<br>(and of a kind who has no objection to government­&para;<br>sponsored worship4). The Town itself has never urged its&para;<br>chaplains to reach out to members of other faiths, or even&para;<br>to recall that they might be present. And accordingly, few&para;<br>chaplains have made any effort to be inclusive; none has&para;<br>thought even to assure attending members of the public&para;<br>that they need not participate in the prayer session.&para;<br>Indeed, as the majority forthrightly recognizes, see ante,&para;<br>at 17, when the plaintiffs here began to voice concern over&para;<br>prayers that excluded some Town residents, one pastor&para;<br>pointedly thanked the Board “[o]n behalf of all God-fearing&para;<br>people” for holding fast, and another declared the objectors&para;<br>“in the minority and . . . ignorant of the history of our&para;<br>country.” App. 137a, 108a.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Leaders of several Baptist and other Christian congregations have&para;<br>explained to the Court that “many Christians believe . . . that their&para;<br>freedom of conscience is violated when they are pressured to participate&para;<br>in government prayer, because such acts of worship should only be&para;<br>performed voluntarily.” Brief for Baptist Joint Committee for Religious&para;<br>Liberty et al. as Amici Curiae 18.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>C&para;<br>Those three differences, taken together, remove this&para;<br>case from the protective ambit of Marsh and the history on&para;<br>which it relied. To recap: Marsh upheld prayer addressed&para;<br>to legislators alone, in a proceeding in which citizens had&para;<br>no role—and even then, only when it did not “proselytize&para;<br>or advance” any single religion. 463 U. S., at 794. It was&para;<br>that legislative prayer practice (not every prayer in a body&para;<br>exercising any legislative function) that the Court found&para;<br>constitutional given its “unambiguous and unbroken&para;<br>history.” Id., at 792. But that approved practice, as I have&para;<br>shown, is not Greece’s. None of the history Marsh cited—&para;<br>and none the majority details today—supports calling on&para;<br>citizens to pray, in a manner consonant with only a single&para;<br>religion’s beliefs, at a participatory public proceeding,&para;<br>having both legislative and adjudicative components. Or&para;<br>to use the majority’s phrase, no “history shows that th[is]&para;<br>specific practice is permitted.” Ante, at 8. And so, contra&para;<br>the majority, Greece’s prayers cannot simply ride on the&para;<br>constitutional coattails of the legislative tradition Marsh&para;<br>described. The Board’s practice must, in its own particu­&para;<br>lars, meet constitutional requirements.&para;<br>And the guideposts for addressing that inquiry include&para;<br>the principles of religious neutrality I discussed earlier.&para;<br>See supra, at 4–8. The government (whether federal,&para;<br>state, or local) may not favor, or align itself with, any&para;<br>particular creed. And that is nowhere more true than&para;<br>when officials and citizens come face to face in their&para;<br>shared institutions of governance. In performing civic&para;<br>functions and seeking civic benefits, each person of this&para;<br>nation must experience a government that belongs to one&para;<br>and all, irrespective of belief. And for its part, each gov­&para;<br>ernment must ensure that its participatory processes will&para;<br>not classify those citizens by faith, or make relevant their&para;<br>religious differences.&para;<br>To decide how Greece fares on that score, think again&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>about how its prayer practice works, meeting after meet­&para;<br>ing. The case, I think, has a fair bit in common with my&para;<br>earlier hypotheticals. See supra, at 2–4, 7. Let’s say that&para;<br>a Muslim citizen of Greece goes before the Board to share&para;<br>her views on policy or request some permit. Maybe she&para;<br>wants the Board to put up a traffic light at a dangerous&para;<br>intersection; or maybe she needs a zoning variance to&para;<br>build an addition on her home. But just before she gets to&para;<br>say her piece, a minister deputized by the Town asks her&para;<br>to pray “in the name of God’s only son Jesus Christ.” App.&para;<br>99a. She must think—it is hardly paranoia, but only the&para;<br>truth—that Christian worship has become entwined with&para;<br>local governance. And now she faces a choice—to pray&para;<br>alongside the majority as one of that group or somehow to&para;<br>register her deeply felt difference. She is a strong person,&para;<br>but that is no easy call—especially given that the room is&para;<br>small and her every action (or inaction) will be noticed.&para;<br>She does not wish to be rude to her neighbors, nor does&para;<br>she wish to aggravate the Board members whom she will&para;<br>soon be trying to persuade. And yet she does not want to&para;<br>acknowledge Christ’s divinity, any more than many of her&para;<br>neighbors would want to deny that tenet. So assume she&para;<br>declines to participate with the others in the first act of&para;<br>the meeting—or even, as the majority proposes, that she&para;<br>stands up and leaves the room altogether, see ante, at 21.&para;<br>At the least, she becomes a different kind of citizen, one&para;<br>who will not join in the religious practice that the Town&para;<br>Board has chosen as reflecting its own and the communi­&para;<br>ty’s most cherished beliefs. And she thus stands at a&para;<br>remove, based solely on religion, from her fellow citizens&para;<br>and her elected representatives.&para;<br>Everything about that situation, I think, infringes the&para;<br>First Amendment. (And of course, as I noted earlier, it&para;<br>would do so no less if the Town’s clergy always used the&para;<br>liturgy of some other religion. See supra, at 4–5.) That&para;<br>the Town Board selects, month after month and year after&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>year, prayergivers who will reliably speak in the voice of&para;<br>Christianity, and so places itself behind a single creed.&para;<br>That in offering those sectarian prayers, the Board’s cho­&para;<br>sen clergy members repeatedly call on individuals, prior to&para;<br>participating in local governance, to join in a form of wor­&para;<br>ship that may be at odds with their own beliefs. That the&para;<br>clergy thus put some residents to the unenviable choice of&para;<br>either pretending to pray like the majority or declining to&para;<br>join its communal activity, at the very moment of petition­&para;<br>ing their elected leaders. That the practice thus divides&para;<br>the citizenry, creating one class that shares the Board’s&para;<br>own evident religious beliefs and another (far smaller)&para;<br>class that does not. And that the practice also alters a&para;<br>dissenting citizen’s relationship with her government,&para;<br>making her religious difference salient when she seeks&para;<br>only to engage her elected representatives as would any&para;<br>other citizen.&para;<br>None of this means that Greece’s town hall must be&para;<br>religion- or prayer-free. “[W]e are a religious people,”&para;<br>Marsh observed, 463 U. S., at 792, and prayer draws some&para;<br>warrant from tradition in a town hall, as well as in Con­&para;<br>gress or a state legislature, see supra, at 8–9. What the&para;<br>circumstances here demand is the recognition that we are&para;<br>a pluralistic people too. When citizens of all faiths come&para;<br>to speak to each other and their elected representatives&para;<br>in a legislative session, the government must take especial care to ensure that the prayers they hear will seek&para;<br>to include, rather than serve to divide. No more is&para;<br>required—but that much is crucial—to treat every citizen,&para;<br>of whatever religion, as an equal participant in her&para;<br>government.&para;<br>And contrary to the majority’s (and JUSTICE ALITO’s)&para;<br>view, see ante, at 13–14; ante, at 4–7, that is not difficult&para;<br>to do. If the Town Board had let its chaplains know that&para;<br>they should speak in nonsectarian terms, common to&para;<br>diverse religious groups, then no one would have valid&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>grounds for complaint. See Joyner v. Forsyth County, 653&para;<br>F. 3d 341, 347 (CA4 2011) (Wilkinson, J.) (Such prayers&para;<br>show that “those of different creeds are in the end kindred&para;<br>spirits, united by a respect paid higher providence and by&para;<br>a belief in the importance of religious faith”). Priests and&para;<br>ministers, rabbis and imams give such invocations all the&para;<br>time; there is no great mystery to the project. (And&para;<br>providing that guidance would hardly have caused the&para;<br>Board to run afoul of the idea that “[t]he First Amendment&para;<br>is not a majority rule,” as the Court (headspinningly)&para;<br>suggests, ante, at 14; what does that is the Board’s refusal&para;<br>to reach out to members of minority religious groups.) Or&para;<br>if the Board preferred, it might have invited clergy of&para;<br>many faiths to serve as chaplains, as the majority notes&para;<br>that Congress does. See ante, at 10–11. When one month&para;<br>a clergy member refers to Jesus, and the next to Allah or&para;<br>Jehovah—as the majority hopefully though counterfactu­&para;<br>ally suggests happened here, see ante, at 10–11, 15—the&para;<br>government does not identify itself with one religion or&para;<br>align itself with that faith’s citizens, and the effect of even&para;<br>sectarian prayer is transformed. So Greece had multiple&para;<br>ways of incorporating prayer into its town meetings—&para;<br>reflecting all the ways that prayer (as most of us know&para;<br>from daily life) can forge common bonds, rather than&para;<br>divide. See also ante, at 4 (BREYER, J., dissenting).&para;<br>But Greece could not do what it did: infuse a participa­&para;<br>tory government body with one (and only one) faith, so&para;<br>that month in and month out, the citizens appearing&para;<br>before it become partly defined by their creed—as those&para;<br>who share, and those who do not, the community’s majority religious belief. In this country, when citizens go before&para;<br>the government, they go not as Christians or Muslims or&para;<br>Jews (or what have you), but just as Americans (or here,&para;<br>as Grecians). That is what it means to be an equal citizen,&para;<br>irrespective of religion. And that is what the Town of&para;<br>Greece precluded by so identifying itself with a single&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>faith.&para;<br>III&para;<br>How, then, does the majority go so far astray, allowing&para;<br>the Town of Greece to turn its assemblies for citizens into&para;<br>a forum for Christian prayer? The answer does not lie in&para;<br>first principles: I have no doubt that every member of this&para;<br>Court believes as firmly as I that our institutions of gov­&para;<br>ernment belong equally to all, regardless of faith. Rather,&para;<br>the error reflects two kinds of blindness. First, the majority misapprehends the facts of this case, as distinct from&para;<br>those characterizing traditional legislative prayer. And&para;<br>second, the majority misjudges the essential meaning of&para;<br>the religious worship in Greece’s town hall, along with its&para;<br>capacity to exclude and divide.&para;<br>The facts here matter to the constitutional issue; indeed, the majority itself acknowledges that the requisite&para;<br>inquiry—a “fact-sensitive” one—turns on “the setting in&para;<br>which the prayer arises and the audience to whom it is&para;<br>directed.” Ante, at 19. But then the majority glides right&para;<br>over those considerations—at least as they relate to the&para;<br>Town of Greece. When the majority analyzes the “setting”&para;<br>and “audience” for prayer, it focuses almost exclusively on&para;<br>Congress and the Nebraska Legislature, see ante, at 6–8,&para;<br>10–11, 15–16, 19–20; it does not stop to analyze how far&para;<br>those factors differ in Greece’s meetings. The majority&para;<br>thus gives short shrift to the gap—more like, the chasm—&para;<br>between a legislative floor session involving only elected&para;<br>officials and a town hall revolving around ordinary citi­&para;<br>zens. And similarly the majority neglects to consider how&para;<br>the prayers in Greece are mostly addressed to members of&para;<br>the public, rather than (as in the forums it discusses) to&para;<br>the lawmakers. “The District Court in Marsh,” the major­&para;<br>ity expounds, “described the prayer exercise as ‘an inter­&para;<br>nal act’ directed at the Nebraska Legislature’s ‘own mem­&para;<br>bers.’ ” Ante, at 19 (quoting Chambers v. Marsh, 504&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>F. Supp., at 588); see ante, at 20 (similarly noting that&para;<br>Nebraska senators “invoke[d] spiritual inspiration entirely&para;<br>for their own benefit” and that prayer in Congress is “reli­&para;<br>gious worship for national representatives” only). Well,&para;<br>yes, so it is in Lincoln, and on Capitol Hill. But not in&para;<br>Greece, where as I have described, the chaplain faces the&para;<br>Town’s residents—with the Board watching from on&para;<br>high—and calls on them to pray together. See supra, at&para;<br>10, 12.&para;<br>And of course—as the majority sidesteps as well—to&para;<br>pray in the name of Jesus Christ. In addressing the sec­&para;<br>tarian content of these prayers, the majority again chang­&para;<br>es the subject, preferring to explain what happens in other&para;<br>government bodies. The majority notes, for example, that&para;<br>Congress “welcom[es] ministers of many creeds,” who&para;<br>commonly speak of “values that count as universal,” ante,&para;<br>at 11, 15; and in that context, the majority opines, the fact&para;<br>“[t]hat a prayer is given in the name of Jesus, Allah, or&para;<br>Jehovah . . . does not remove it from” Marsh’s protection,&para;<br>see ante, at 15. But that case is not this one, as I have&para;<br>shown, because in Greece only Christian clergy members&para;<br>speak, and then mostly in the voice of their own religion;&para;<br>no Allah or Jehovah ever is mentioned. See supra, at 13–&para;<br>14. So all the majority can point to in the Town’s practice&para;<br>is that the Board “maintains a policy of nondiscrimina­&para;<br>tion,” and “represent[s] that it would welcome a prayer by&para;<br>any minister or layman who wishe[s] to give one.” Ante, at&para;<br>17–18. But that representation has never been publicized;&para;<br>nor has the Board (except for a few months surrounding&para;<br>this suit’s filing) offered the chaplain’s role to any nonChristian clergy or layman, in either Greece or its envi­&para;<br>rons; nor has the Board ever provided its chaplains with&para;<br>guidance about reaching out to members of other faiths, as&para;<br>most state legislatures and Congress do. See 732 F. Supp.&para;<br>2d 195, 197–203 (WDNY 2010); National Conference of&para;<br>State Legislatures, Inside the Legislative Process: Prayer&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Practices 5–145, 5–146 (2002); ante, at 5 (BREYER, J.,&para;<br>dissenting).&para;<br>The majority thus errs in assimilating&para;<br>the Board’s prayer practice to that of Congress or the Nebraska Legislature. Unlike those models, the Board is&para;<br>determinedly—and relentlessly—noninclusive.5&para;<br>And the month in, month out sectarianism the Board&para;<br>chose for its meetings belies the majority’s refrain that the&para;<br>prayers in Greece were “ceremonial” in nature. Ante, at&para;<br>16, 19, 21, 23. Ceremonial references to the divine surely&para;<br>abound: The majority is right that “the Pledge of Alle­&para;<br>giance, inaugural prayer, or the recitation of ‘God save the&para;<br>United States and this honorable Court’ ” each fits the bill.&para;<br>Ante, at 19. But prayers evoking “the saving sacrifice of&para;<br>Jesus Christ on the cross,” “the plan of redemption that is&para;<br>fulfilled in Jesus Christ,” “the life and death, resurrection&para;<br>and ascension of the Savior Jesus Christ,” the workings of&para;<br>the Holy Spirit, the events of Pentecost, and the belief that&para;<br>God “has raised up the Lord Jesus” and “will raise us, in&para;<br>our turn, and put us by His side”? See App. 56a, 88a–89a,&para;<br>99a, 123a, 129a, 134a. No. These are statements of pro­&para;<br>found belief and deep meaning, subscribed to by many,&para;<br>denied by some. They “speak of the depths of [one’s] life,&para;<br>of the source of [one’s] being, of [one’s] ultimate concern, of&para;<br>what [one] take[s] seriously without any reservation.” P.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 JUSTICE ALITO similarly falters in attempting to excuse the Town&para;<br>Board’s constant sectarianism. His concurring opinion takes great&para;<br>pains to show that the problem arose from a sort of bureaucratic glitch:&para;<br>The Town’s clerks, he writes, merely “did a bad job in compiling the&para;<br>list” of chaplains. Ante, at 6; see ante, at 1–3. Now I suppose one&para;<br>question that account raises is why in over a decade, no member of the&para;<br>Board noticed that the clerk’s list was producing prayers of only one&para;<br>kind. But put that aside. Honest oversight or not, the problem re­&para;<br>mains: Every month for more than a decade, the Board aligned itself,&para;<br>through its prayer practices, with a single religion. That the concurring&para;<br>opinion thinks my objection to that is “really quite niggling,” ante, at 4,&para;<br>says all there is to say about the difference between our respective&para;<br>views.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Tillich, The Shaking of the Foundations 57 (1948). If they&para;<br>(and the central tenets of other religions) ever become&para;<br>mere ceremony, this country will be a fundamentally&para;<br>different—and, I think, poorer—place to live.&para;<br>But just for that reason, the not-so-implicit message of&para;<br>the majority’s opinion—“What’s the big deal, anyway?”—is&para;<br>mistaken. The content of Greece’s prayers is a big deal, to&para;<br>Christians and non-Christians alike. A person’s response&para;<br>to the doctrine, language, and imagery contained in those&para;<br>invocations reveals a core aspect of identity—who that&para;<br>person is and how she faces the world. And the responses&para;<br>of different individuals, in Greece and across this country,&para;<br>of course vary. Contrary to the majority’s apparent view,&para;<br>such sectarian prayers are not “part of our expressive&para;<br>idiom” or “part of our heritage and tradition,” assuming&para;<br>the word “our” refers to all Americans. Ante, at 19. They&para;<br>express beliefs that are fundamental to some, foreign to&para;<br>others—and because that is so they carry the ever-present&para;<br>potential to both exclude and divide. The majority, I&para;<br>think, assesses too lightly the significance of these reli­&para;<br>gious differences, and so fears too little the “religiously&para;<br>based divisiveness that the Establishment Clause seeks to&para;<br>avoid.” Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U. S. 677, 704 (2005)&para;<br>(BREYER, J., concurring in judgment). I would treat more&para;<br>seriously the multiplicity of Americans’ religious commit­&para;<br>ments, along with the challenge they can pose to the&para;<br>project—the distinctively American project—of creating&para;<br>one from the many, and governing all as united.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>In 1790, George Washington traveled to Newport, Rhode&para;<br>Island, a longtime bastion of religious liberty and the&para;<br>home of one of the first communities of American Jews. Among&para;<br>the citizens he met there was Moses Seixas, one of that&para;<br>congregation’s lay officials. The ensuing exchange be­&para;<br>tween the two conveys, as well as anything I know, the&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>TOWN OF GREECE v. GALLOWAY&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>promise this country makes to members of every religion.&para;<br>Seixas wrote first, welcoming Washington to Newport.&para;<br>He spoke of “a deep sense of gratitude” for the new Ameri­&para;<br>can Government—“a Government, which to bigotry gives&para;<br>no sanction, to persecution no assistance—but generously&para;<br>affording to All liberty of conscience, and immunities of&para;<br>Citizenship: deeming every one, of whatever Nation,&para;<br>tongue, or language, equal parts of the great governmental&para;<br>Machine.” Address from Newport Hebrew Congregation&para;<br>(Aug. 17, 1790), in 6 PGW 286, n. 1 (M. Mastromarino ed.&para;<br>1996). The first phrase there is the more poetic: a gov­&para;<br>ernment that to “bigotry gives no sanction, to persecution&para;<br>no assistance.” But the second is actually the more star­&para;<br>tling and transformative: a government that, beyond not&para;<br>aiding persecution, grants “immunities of citizenship” to&para;<br>the Christian and the Jew alike, and makes them “equal&para;<br>parts” of the whole country.&para;<br>Washington responded the very next day. Like any&para;<br>successful politician, he appreciated a great line when he&para;<br>saw one—and knew to borrow it too. And so he repeated,&para;<br>word for word, Seixas’s phrase about neither sanctioning&para;<br>bigotry nor assisting persecution. But he no less embraced&para;<br>the point Seixas had made about equality of citizenship.&para;<br>“It is now no more,” Washington said, “that toleration is&para;<br>spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of&para;<br>people” to another, lesser one. For “[a]ll possess alike . . .&para;<br>immunities of citizenship.” Letter to Newport Hebrew&para;<br>Congregation (Aug. 18, 1790), in 6 PGW 285. That is&para;<br>America’s promise in the First Amendment: full and equal&para;<br>membership in the polity for members of every religious&para;<br>group, assuming only that they, like anyone “who live[s]&para;<br>under [the Government’s] protection[,] should demean&para;<br>themselves as good citizens.” Ibid.&para;<br>For me, that remarkable guarantee means at least this&para;<br>much: When the citizens of this country approach their&para;<br>government, they do so only as Americans, not as mem­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

And that means that even&para;<br>in a partly legislative body, they should not confront&para;<br>government-sponsored worship that divides them along&para;<br>religious lines.
