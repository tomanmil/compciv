Argued March 2, 2010—Decided May 3, 2010&para;<br>While detained by immigration authorities, Francisco Castaneda per&para;<br>sistently sought treatment for a bleeding, suppurating lesion. Al&para;<br>though a U. S. Public Health Service (PHS) physician’s assistant and&para;<br>three outside specialists repeatedly advised that Castaneda urgently&para;<br>needed a biopsy, petitioners—a PHS physician and a commissioned&para;<br>PHS officer—denied the request. After Castaneda was released from&para;<br>custody, tests confirmed that he had metastatic cancer. He then filed&para;<br>this suit, raising medical negligence claims against the United States&para;<br>under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C. §§1346, 2671–&para;<br>2680, and constitutional claims against petitioners under Bivens v.&para;<br>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 397. When Cas&para;<br>taneda died, respondents, his representative and heir, were substi&para;<br>tuted as plaintiffs. The District Court denied petitioners’ motion to&para;<br>dismiss the Bivens action, rejecting their claim of absolute immunity&para;<br>under 42 U. S. C. §233(a), which provides: “The [FTCA] remedy&para;<br>against the United States provided by [28 U. S. C. §§1346(b) and&para;<br>2672] for damage for personal injury, including death, resulting from&para;<br>the performance of medical . . . or related functions . . . by any [PHS]&para;<br>commissioned officer or employee . . . while acting within the scope of&para;<br>his office or employment, shall be exclusive of any other civil action or&para;<br>proceeding by reason of the same subject-matter against the officer or&para;<br>employee.” (Emphasis added.) The Ninth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: The immunity provided by §233(a) precludes Bivens actions&para;<br>against individual PHS officers or employees for harms arising out of&para;<br>constitutional violations committed while acting within the scope of&para;<br>their office or employment. Pp. 5–13.&para;<br>(a) The Court’s inquiry begins and ends with §233(a)’s text, which&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HUI v. CASTANEDA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>plainly precludes a Bivens action against petitioners by limiting re&para;<br>covery for harms arising from the conduct at issue to an FTCA action&para;<br>against the United States. The breadth of §233(a)’s words “exclusive”&para;<br>and “any” supports this reading, as does the provision’s inclusive ref&para;<br>erence to all civil proceedings arising out of “the same subject&para;<br>matter.” Because the phrase “exclusive of any other civil action” is&para;<br>easily broad enough to accommodate both known and unknown&para;<br>causes of action, the Court’s reading is not undermined by the fact&para;<br>that §233(a) preceded Bivens. The later enacted Westfall Act further&para;<br>supports this understanding of §233(a). In amending the FTCA to&para;<br>make its remedy against the United States exclusive for most claims&para;<br>against Government employees for their official conduct, the Westfall&para;<br>Act essentially duplicated §233(a)’s exclusivity language, 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§ 2679(b)(1), but provided an explicit exception for constitutional vio&para;<br>lations, §2679(b)(2). This shows that Congress did not understand&para;<br>the exclusivity provided by §2679(b)(1)—or the substantially similar&para;<br>§233(a)—to imply such an exception. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>(b) Respondents’ arguments to the contrary do not undermine the&para;<br>Court’s conclusion. Pp. 7–12.&para;<br>(1) Respondents’ heavy reliance on Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S.&para;<br>14, is misplaced. Carlson is inapposite to the issue in this case—&para;<br>whether petitioners are immune from suit for the alleged violations—&para;<br>because the Carlson petitioners invoked no official immunity. In&para;<br>stead, the case considered the separate question whether a remedy&para;<br>was available under the Eighth Amendment for alleged violations of&para;<br>the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause notwithstanding that a&para;<br>federal remedy was also available under the FTCA. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(2) Contrary to respondents’ contention, §233(a) does not incorpo&para;<br>rate a Bivens exception through its cross-reference to §1346(b) and&para;<br>that section’s cross-reference to the FTCA, which includes the&para;<br>Westfall Act exception for constitutional claims, §2679(b)(2)(A). Be&para;<br>cause §233(a) refers only to “[t]he remedy . . . provided by sections&para;<br>1346(b) and 2672” (emphasis added), only those portions of the FTCA&para;<br>that establish its remedy are incorporated by §233(a)’s reference to&para;<br>§1346. Section 2679(b) is not such a provision. Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(3) Respondents’ claim that the Westfall Act’s Bivens exception,&para;<br>§2679(b)(2)(A), directly preserves a Bivens action against PHS offi&para;<br>cers and employees is belied by the fact that the provision by its&para;<br>terms applies only to the specific immunity set forth in “[p]aragraph&para;<br>(1).” Moreover, if §233(a) forecloses a Bivens action against PHS per&para;<br>sonnel, respondents’ reading of §2679(b)(2)(A) would effect an implied&para;<br>repeal of the more specific §233(a). Repeals by implication are not&para;<br>favored and will not be presumed absent a clear and manifest legisla&para;<br>tive intent to repeal. Hawaii v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 556 U.

Nothing suggests that Congress intended §2679(b) to repeal&para;<br>§233(a)’s more comprehensive immunity. P. 10.&para;<br>(4) Respondents’ contention that other features of §233 show that&para;<br>§233(a) does not make the FTCA remedy exclusive of all other actions&para;<br>against PHS personnel is rejected.

CASTANEDA &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>Francisco Castaneda was detained by U. S. Immigration&para;<br>and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the San Diego Correc&para;<br>tional Facility (SDCF) beginning in March 2006. Accord&para;<br>ing to the complaint later filed in the District Court, when&para;<br>Castaneda arrived at SDCF he had on his penis an irregu&para;<br>lar, raised lesion that measured roughly two centimeters&para;<br>square.1 Castaneda promptly brought his condition to the&para;<br>attention of medical personnel working for the Division of&para;<br>Immigration Health Services, reporting that the lesion&para;<br>was growing in size and becoming more painful and that it&para;<br>frequently bled and emitted a discharge. Petitioner Dr.&para;<br>Esther Hui, a civilian PHS employee, was the physician&para;<br>responsible for Castaneda’s medical care during his deten&para;<br>tion at SDCF. Petitioner Commander Stephen Gonsalves,&para;<br>a commissioned PHS officer, was a Health Services Ad&para;<br>ministrator at SDCF during the relevant period.&para;<br>Between March 2006 and January 2007, Castaneda&para;<br>persistently sought treatment for his condition. As his&para;<br>disease progressed, the lesion became increasingly painful&para;<br>and interfered with his urination, defecation, and sleep.&para;<br>In December 2006, Castaneda additionally reported a&para;<br>lump in his groin. A PHS physician’s assistant and three&para;<br>outside specialists repeatedly advised that Castaneda&para;<br>needed a biopsy to ascertain whether he had cancer.&para;<br>Petitioners denied requests for a biopsy and other recom&para;<br>mended procedures as “elective.” App. 244, 249–251.&para;<br>Instead, Castaneda was treated with ibuprofen and anti&para;<br>biotics and was given an additional ration of boxer shorts.&para;<br>After a fourth specialist recommended a biopsy in Janu&para;<br>ary 2007, the procedure was finally authorized. Instead of&para;<br>providing treatment, however, ICE released Castaneda&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Because this case comes to us on petitioners’ motion to dismiss, we&para;<br>assume the truth of respondents’ factual allegations.

A week later, biopsy results&para;<br>confirmed that Castaneda was suffering from penile can&para;<br>cer. The next day, Castaneda had his penis amputated,&para;<br>and he began chemotherapy after tests confirmed that the&para;<br>cancer had metastasized to his groin. The treatment was&para;<br>unsuccessful, and Castaneda died in February 2008.&para;<br>Three months before his death, Castaneda filed suit&para;<br>against petitioners in the United States District Court for&para;<br>the Central District of California. As relevant, Castaneda&para;<br>raised medical negligence claims against the United&para;<br>States under the FTCA and Bivens claims against peti&para;<br>tioners for deliberate indifference to his serious medical&para;<br>needs in violation of his Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth&para;<br>Amendment rights.2 After Castaneda’s death, respon&para;<br>dents—Castaneda’s sister, Yanira Castaneda, and his&para;<br>daughter, Vanessa Castaneda (by and through her&para;<br>mother, Lucia Pelayo)—amended the complaint to substi&para;<br>tute themselves as plaintiffs. Yanira and Vanessa Casta&para;<br>neda are respectively the representative of and heir to&para;<br>Castaneda’s estate.&para;<br>Petitioners moved to dismiss the claims against them,&para;<br>contending that §233(a) gives them absolute immunity&para;<br>from Bivens actions by making a suit against the United&para;<br>States under the FTCA the exclusive remedy for harms&para;<br>caused by PHS personnel in the course of their medical or&para;<br>related duties. The District Court denied the motion,&para;<br>concluding that §233(a)’s text and history evidence a&para;<br>congressional intent to preserve Bivens actions. Casta&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 In&para;<br>&para;<br>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 397&para;<br>(1971), this Court recognized an implied cause of action for damages&para;<br>against federal officers alleged to have violated the petitioner’s Fourth&para;<br>Amendment rights. We subsequently found such a remedy available&para;<br>for violations of an individual’s rights under the Cruel and Unusual&para;<br>Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process&para;<br>Clause. See Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S. 14, 17–19 (1980); Davis v.&para;<br>Passman, 442 U. S. 228, 230 (1979).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HUI v. CASTANEDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>neda v. United States, 538 F. Supp. 2d 1279, 1288–1295&para;<br>(2008). Petitioners filed an interlocutory appeal.3&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the&para;<br>District Court’s judgment that §233(a) does not preclude&para;<br>respondents’ Bivens claims. Castaneda v. United States,&para;<br>546 F. 3d 682 (2008).4 The court cited Carlson v. Green,&para;<br>446 U. S. 14 (1980), for the proposition that a Bivens&para;<br>remedy is unavailable only when an alternative remedy is&para;<br>both expressly declared to be a substitute and can be&para;<br>viewed as equally effective, or when special factors mili&para;<br>tate against direct recovery. Looking to the statute’s text&para;<br>and history, the court noted that §233(a) does not mention&para;<br>the Constitution or recovery thereunder and found it&para;<br>significant that §233 was enacted prior to this Court’s&para;<br>decision in Bivens. Drawing further support for its view&para;<br>from the statute’s legislative history and from subsequent&para;<br>congressional enactments, the Court of Appeals concluded&para;<br>that §233(a) does not expressly make the remedy under&para;<br>the FTCA a substitute for relief under Bivens.&para;<br>For essentially the reasons given in Carlson, 446 U. S.,&para;<br>at 20–23, the Court of Appeals also determined that the&para;<br>FTCA remedy is not equally effective as a Bivens remedy.&para;<br>Unlike the remedy under the FTCA, the court reasoned, a&para;<br>Bivens remedy is awarded against individual defendants&para;<br>and may include punitive damages. Additionally, Bivens&para;<br>cases may be tried before a jury, and liability is governed&para;<br>by uniform federal rules rather than the law of the State&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Although it does not bear directly on the question presented in this&para;<br>case, we note that while petitioners’ appeal was pending the Govern&para;<br>ment filed a formal notice admitting liability with respect to respon&para;<br>dents’ claims for medical negligence under the FTCA. App. 329.&para;<br>4 The court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the interlocutory&para;<br>appeal because district court orders denying absolute immunity consti&para;<br>tute “final decisions” for purposes of 28 U. S. C. §1291. See 546 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 687 (citing Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 524–527 (1985)); see&para;<br>also Osborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225, 238–239 (2007).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>in which the violation occurred. After further concluding&para;<br>that no special factors militate against finding a remedy&para;<br>available in these circumstances, the court held that&para;<br>respondents’ Bivens action could proceed.&para;<br>As the Ninth Circuit recognized, its holding conflicts&para;<br>with the Second Circuit’s decision in Cuoco v. Moritsugu,&para;<br>222 F. 3d 99 (2000), which construed §233(a) to foreclose&para;<br>Bivens actions against PHS personnel. We granted certio&para;<br>rari to resolve this conflict. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Our inquiry in this case begins and ends with the text of&para;<br>§233(a). See Harris Trust and Sav. Bank v. Salomon&para;<br>Smith Barney Inc., 530 U. S. 238, 254 (2000). The statute&para;<br>provides in pertinent part that:&para;<br>“[t]he remedy against the United States provided by&para;<br>sections 1346(b) and 2672 of title 28 . . . for damage&para;<br>for personal injury, including death, resulting from&para;<br>the performance of medical, surgical, dental, or re&para;<br>lated functions, including the conduct of clinical stud&para;<br>ies or investigation, by any commissioned officer or&para;<br>employee of the Public Health Service while acting&para;<br>within the scope of his office or employment, shall be&para;<br>exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by rea&para;<br>son of the same subject-matter against the officer or&para;<br>employee (or his estate) whose act or omission gave&para;<br>rise to the claim.” §233(a) (emphasis added).&para;<br>Section 233(a) grants absolute immunity to PHS officers&para;<br>and employees for actions arising out of the performance&para;<br>of medical or related functions within the scope of their&para;<br>employment by barring all actions against them for such&para;<br>conduct. By its terms, §233(a) limits recovery for such&para;<br>conduct to suits against the United States. The breadth of&para;<br>the words “exclusive” and “any” supports this reading, as&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HUI v. CASTANEDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>does the provision’s inclusive reference to all civil proceed&para;<br>ings arising out of “the same subject-matter.” We have&para;<br>previously cited §233(a) to support the contention that&para;<br>“Congress follows the practice of explicitly stating when it&para;<br>means to make FTCA an exclusive remedy.” Carlson, 446&para;<br>U. S., at 20. The meaning of §233(a) has become no less&para;<br>explicit since we last made that observation.&para;<br>Our reading of §233(a)’s text is not undermined by the&para;<br>fact that the provision preceded our decision in Bivens.&para;<br>Contrary to the view of the Court of Appeals, that a Bivens&para;<br>remedy had not yet been recognized when §233(a) was&para;<br>enacted does not support the conclusion that Congress, in&para;<br>making the remedy provided by the FTCA “exclusive of&para;<br>any other civil action,” did not mean what it said. Lan&para;<br>guage that broad easily accommodates both known and&para;<br>unknown causes of action.&para;<br>The later enacted Federal Employees Liability Reform&para;<br>and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (Westfall Act), 102&para;<br>Stat. 4563, further supports this understanding of §233(a).&para;<br>The Westfall Act amended the FTCA to make its remedy&para;<br>against the United States the exclusive remedy for most&para;<br>claims against Government employees arising out of their&para;<br>official conduct.5 In providing this official immunity,&para;<br>Congress used essentially the same language as it did in&para;<br>§233(a), stating that the remedy against the United States&para;<br>is “exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding,”&para;<br>§2679(b)(1). Notably, Congress also provided an exception&para;<br>for constitutional violations. Pursuant to §2679(b)(2), the&para;<br>immunity granted by §2679(b)(1) “does not extend or apply&para;<br>to a civil action against an employee of the Government&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Prior to the Westfall Act amendments, the FTCA authorized substi&para;<br>tution of the United States as a defendant in suits against federal&para;<br>employees for harms arising out of conduct undertaken in the scope of&para;<br>their employment, see 28 U. S. C. §1346(b) (1982 ed.), but it made that&para;<br>remedy “exclusive” only for harms resulting from a federal employee’s&para;<br>operation of a motor vehicle, §2679(b).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>. . . brought for a violation of the Constitution of the&para;<br>United States.” §2679(b)(2)(A). The Westfall Act’s explicit&para;<br>exception for Bivens claims is powerful evidence that&para;<br>Congress did not understand the exclusivity provided by&para;<br>§2679(b)(1)—or the substantially similar §233(a)—to&para;<br>imply such an exception. Given Congress’ awareness of&para;<br>pre-existing immunity provisions like §233 when it en&para;<br>acted the Westfall Act, see United States v. Smith, 499&para;<br>U. S. 160, 173 (1991), it is telling that Congress declined to&para;<br>enact a similar exception to the immunity provided by&para;<br>§233(a).&para;<br>B&para;<br>In advocating a contrary reading of §233(a), respondents&para;<br>rely heavily on our opinion in Carlson, as did the Court of&para;<br>Appeals. Carlson, however, is inapposite to the issue in&para;<br>this case. There are two separate inquiries involved in&para;<br>determining whether a Bivens action may proceed against&para;<br>a federal agent: whether the agent is amenable to suit,&para;<br>and whether a damages remedy is available for a particu&para;<br>lar constitutional violation absent authorization by Con&para;<br>gress. See United States v. Stanley, 483 U. S. 669, 684&para;<br>(1987) (“[T]he availability of a damages action under the&para;<br>Constitution for particular injuries . . . is a question logi&para;<br>cally distinct from immunity to such an action on the part&para;<br>of particular defendants”). Even in circumstances in&para;<br>which a Bivens remedy is generally available, an action&para;<br>under Bivens will be defeated if the defendant is immune&para;<br>from suit. See, e.g., 403 U. S., at 397–398 (remanding for&para;<br>determination of respondents’ immunity after implying a&para;<br>cause of action under the Fourth Amendment).&para;<br>Because petitioners in Carlson invoked no official im&para;<br>munity, the Court did not address that question. Instead,&para;<br>it considered whether a remedy was available under the&para;<br>Eighth Amendment for alleged violations of the Cruel and&para;<br>Unusual Punishments Clause notwithstanding that a&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HUI v. CASTANEDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>federal remedy was also available under the FTCA. 446&para;<br>U. S., at 16–17. Many of our subsequent Bivens decisions&para;<br>likewise addressed only the existence of an implied cause&para;<br>of action for an alleged constitutional violation. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U. S. 537, 549 (2007) (declining “to&para;<br>devise a new Bivens damages action for retaliating against&para;<br>the exercise of ownership rights”); Bush v. Lucas, 462&para;<br>U. S. 367, 368 (1983) (declining to “authorize a new non&para;<br>statutory damages remedy for federal employees whose&para;<br>First Amendment rights are violated by their superiors”).&para;<br>This case presents the separate question whether peti&para;<br>tioners are immune from suit for the alleged violations.&para;<br>To determine a defendant’s amenability to suit, we con&para;<br>sider whether he or she may claim the benefits of official&para;<br>immunity for the alleged misconduct. Because petitioners&para;<br>invoke only the immunity provided by §233(a), the ques&para;<br>tion in this case is answered solely by reference to whether&para;<br>that provision gives petitioners the immunity they claim.6&para;<br>As noted, the text of §233(a) plainly indicates that it&para;<br>precludes a Bivens action against petitioners for the harm&para;<br>alleged in this case. Respondents offer three arguments in&para;<br>support of their claim that it does not. None persuades us&para;<br>that §233(a) means something other than what it says.&para;<br>Respondents first contend that §233(a) incorporates the&para;<br>entirety of the FTCA, as amended by the Westfall Act,&para;<br>through its reference to §1346(b).7 Section 1346(b) in turn&para;<br>refers to “the provisions of chapter 171,” which constitute&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 We express no opinion as to whether a Bivens remedy is otherwise&para;<br>available in these circumstances, as the question is not presented in&para;<br>this case.&para;<br>7 Section 1346(b) provides in pertinent part that, “[s]ubject to the&para;<br>provisions of chapter 171 of [Title 28], the district courts . . . shall have&para;<br>exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United&para;<br>States, for money damages . . . for injury or loss of property, or personal&para;<br>injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of&para;<br>any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his&para;<br>office or employment.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Through this series of&para;<br>cross-references, respondents would read that exception&para;<br>for Bivens actions into §233(a).&para;<br>Section 233(a) is not susceptible of this reading. As&para;<br>petitioners observe, that provision refers only to “[t]he&para;<br>remedy against the United States provided by sections&para;<br>1346(b) and 2672.” §233(a) (emphasis added). Thus, only&para;<br>those portions of chapter 171 that establish the FTCA&para;<br>remedy are incorporated by §233(a)’s reference to §1346.&para;<br>Section 2679(b) is not such a provision. Section 233(a)’s&para;<br>reference to §26728—which is codified in chapter 171—also&para;<br>belies respondents’ theory.&para;<br>If §233(a)’s reference to&para;<br>§1346(b) served to incorporate all the provisions of chapter&para;<br>171, the separate reference to §2672 would be superfluous.&para;<br>Respondents next argue that the Westfall Act’s Bivens&para;<br>exception, §2679(b)(2)(A), directly preserves a Bivens&para;<br>action against PHS officers and employees.&para;<br>That&para;<br>§2679(b)(2)(A) by its terms applies only to the specific&para;<br>immunity set forth in “[p]aragraph (1)” belies respondents’&para;<br>claim. Moreover, if §233(a) forecloses a Bivens action&para;<br>against PHS personnel, respondents’ reading of&para;<br>§2679(b)(2)(A) would effect an implied repeal of that more&para;<br>specific provision. Although we noted in Smith that&para;<br>§2679(b) applies to all federal employees, see 499 U. S., at&para;<br>173, we had no occasion to consider whether the Bivens&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Section 2672 authorizes agency heads and their designees to “con&para;<br>sider, ascertain, adjust, determine, compromise, and settle any claim&para;<br>for money damages against the United States for injury or loss of&para;<br>property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrong&para;<br>ful act or omission of any employee of the agency while acting within&para;<br>the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the&para;<br>United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in&para;<br>accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission oc&para;<br>curred.”&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HUI v. CASTANEDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>exception in §2679(b)(2)(A) impliedly repealed pre-existing&para;<br>immunity provisions to the extent of any inconsistency.&para;<br>“As we have emphasized, repeals by implication are not&para;<br>favored and will not be presumed unless the intention of&para;<br>the legislature to repeal is clear and manifest.” Hawaii v.&para;<br>Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 556 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2009)&para;<br>(slip op., at 10–11) (internal quotation marks and altera&para;<br>tion omitted). Respondents have pointed to nothing in&para;<br>§2679(b)’s text or drafting history that suggests that Con&para;<br>gress intended to repeal the more comprehensive immu&para;<br>nity provided by §233(a).&para;<br>Finally, respondents contend that other features of §233&para;<br>show that subsection (a) does not make the remedy under&para;<br>the FTCA exclusive of all other actions against PHS per&para;<br>sonnel. Respondents first note §233’s lack of a procedure&para;<br>for “scope certification” in federal-court actions. Under the&para;<br>FTCA, “certification by the Attorney General that the&para;<br>defendant employee was acting within the scope of his&para;<br>office or employment at the time of the incident out of&para;<br>which the claim arose” transforms an action against an&para;<br>individual federal employee into one against the United&para;<br>States. §2679(d)(1). Because §233 does not provide a&para;<br>similar mechanism for scope certification in federal-court&para;<br>actions,9 respondents contend that PHS defendants seek&para;<br>ing to invoke the immunity provided by §233(a) must rely&para;<br>on the FTCA’s scope certification procedure, set forth in&para;<br>§2679(d). Section 2679(d), respondents note, is in turn&para;<br>subject to the “limitations and exceptions” applicable to&para;<br>actions under the FTCA—including the exception for&para;<br>Bivens actions provided by §2679(b)(2). See §2679(d)(4).&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Section 233(c) includes such a provision for state-court actions, au&para;<br>thorizing removal to federal court “[u]pon a certification by the Attor&para;<br>ney General that the defendant was acting in the scope of his employ&para;<br>ment at the time of the incident out of which the suit arose,” but unlike&para;<br>§2679(d) it does not prescribe a particular mechanism for substituting&para;<br>the United States in federal-court actions.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We agree with petitioners that there is no reason to&para;<br>think that scope certification by the Attorney General is a&para;<br>prerequisite to immunity under §233(a). To be sure, that&para;<br>immunity is contingent upon the alleged misconduct&para;<br>having occurred in the course of the PHS defendant’s&para;<br>duties, but a defendant may make that proof pursuant to&para;<br>the ordinary rules of evidence and procedure. As petition&para;<br>ers observe, proof of scope is in most §233(a) cases estab&para;<br>lished by a declaration affirming that the defendant was a&para;<br>PHS official during the relevant time period. See Reply&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner Hui 6–7, and n. 1. Thus, while scope&para;<br>certification may provide a convenient mechanism for&para;<br>establishing that the alleged misconduct occurred within&para;<br>the scope of the employee’s duties, the procedure author&para;<br>ized by §2679(d) is not necessary to effect substitution of&para;<br>the United States. Finally, that the FTCA’s scope certifi&para;<br>cation procedure was enacted almost two decades after&para;<br>§233(a) confirms that Congress did not intend to make&para;<br>that procedure the exclusive means for PHS personnel to&para;<br>invoke the official immunity provided by §233(a).&para;<br>Respondents’ argument based on §233(f) is similarly&para;<br>unavailing. That subsection authorizes the Secretary of&para;<br>Health and Human Services to “hold harmless or provide&para;<br>liability insurance” for a PHS officer or employee for per&para;<br>sonal injuries caused by conduct occurring “within the&para;<br>scope of his office or employment . . . if such employee is&para;<br>assigned to a foreign country . . . and if the circumstances&para;<br>are such as are likely to preclude the remedies of third&para;<br>persons against the United States described in section&para;<br>2679(b).”&para;<br>Noting that the FTCA precludes recovery&para;<br>against the United States for “[a]ny claim arising in a&para;<br>foreign country,” §2680(k), respondents urge that §233(f)’s&para;<br>authorization of insurance or indemnification in those&para;<br>circumstances anticipates that an injured party without a&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HUI v. CASTANEDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>remedy under the FTCA may sue a PHS official directly.10&para;<br>Accordingly, respondents contend, §233(a) cannot be read&para;<br>to make the remedy under the FTCA truly exclusive.&para;<br>Even if that reading of §233(f) were correct, it would not&para;<br>benefit respondents because an FTCA remedy is unques&para;<br>tionably available for the misconduct alleged in this case.&para;<br>For the foregoing reasons, respondents’ arguments do&para;<br>not undermine our conclusion that the immunity provided&para;<br>by §233(a) precludes Bivens actions against individual&para;<br>PHS officers or employees for harms arising out of conduct&para;<br>described in that section.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>In construing §233(a) in petitioners’ favor, we are mind&para;<br>ful of the confines of our judicial role. Respondents’ amici&para;<br>caution that providing special immunity for PHS person&para;<br>nel is contrary to the public interest.11 Respondents like&para;<br>wise contend that allowing Bivens claims against PHS&para;<br>personnel is necessary to ensure an adequate standard of&para;<br>care in federal detention facilities, and they further urge&para;<br>that permitting such actions would not endanger PHS’&para;<br>institutional interests as it would simply place PHS per&para;<br>sonnel in the same position as other federal employees&para;<br>who perform similar functions. See Brief for Respondents&para;<br>52–55, 60–61. We are required, however, to read the&para;<br>statute according to its text. Because §233(a) plainly&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 As&para;<br>&para;<br>respondents note, the Westfall Act substantially limited the&para;<br>effect of §233(f). See Brief for Respondents 32 (citing United States v.&para;<br>Smith, 499 U. S. 160, 166–167 (1991)).
