COAKLEY, ATTORNEY GENERAL&para;<br>OF MASSACHUSETTS, ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIRST CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–1168. Argued January 15, 2014—Decided June 26, 2014&para;<br>In 2007, Massachusetts amended its Reproductive Health Care Facili­&para;<br>ties Act, which had been enacted in 2000 to address clashes between&para;<br>abortion opponents and advocates of abortion rights outside clinics&para;<br>where abortions were performed. The amended version of the Act&para;<br>makes it a crime to knowingly stand on a “public way or sidewalk”&para;<br>within 35 feet of an entrance or driveway to any “reproductive health&para;<br>care facility,” defined as “a place, other than within or upon the&para;<br>grounds of a hospital, where abortions are offered or performed.”&para;<br>Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §§120E½(a), (b). The Act exempts from&para;<br>this prohibition four classes of individuals, including “employees or&para;<br>agents of such facility acting within the scope of their employment.”&para;<br>§120E½(b)(2). Another provision of the Act proscribes the knowing&para;<br>obstruction of access to an abortion clinic. §120E½(e).&para;<br>McCullen and the other petitioners are individuals who attempt to&para;<br>engage women approaching Massachusetts abortion clinics in “side­&para;<br>walk counseling,” which involves offering information about alterna­&para;<br>tives to abortion and help pursuing those options. They claim that&para;<br>the 35-foot buffer zones have displaced them from their previous po­&para;<br>sitions outside the clinics, considerably hampering their counseling&para;<br>efforts. Their attempts to communicate with patients are further&para;<br>thwarted, they claim, by clinic “escorts,” who accompany arriving pa­&para;<br>tients through the buffer zones to the clinic entrances.&para;<br>Petitioners sued Attorney General Coakley and other Common­&para;<br>wealth officials, seeking to enjoin the Act’s enforcement on the&para;<br>ground that it violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, both&para;<br>on its face and as applied to them. The District Court denied both&para;<br>challenges, and the First Circuit affirmed. With regard to petition­&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v. COAKLEY&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ers’ facial challenge, the First Circuit held that the Act was a reason­&para;<br>able “time, place, and manner” regulation under the test set forth in&para;<br>Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The Massachusetts Act violates the First Amendment. Pp. 8–30.&para;<br>(a) By its very terms, the Act restricts access to “public way[s]” and&para;<br>“sidewalk[s],” places that have traditionally been open for speech ac­&para;<br>tivities and that the Court has accordingly labeled “traditional public&para;<br>fora,” Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460, 469. The gov­&para;<br>ernment’s ability to regulate speech in such locations is “very lim­&para;<br>ited.” United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 177. “[E]ven in a public&para;<br>forum,” however, “the government may impose reasonable re­&para;<br>strictions on the time, place, or manner of protected speech, provided&para;<br>the restrictions ‘are justified without reference to the content of the&para;<br>regulated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a signifi­&para;<br>cant governmental interest, and that they leave open ample alterna­&para;<br>tive channels for communication of the information,’ ” Ward, supra,&para;<br>at 791. Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(b) Because the Act is neither content nor viewpoint based, it need&para;<br>not be analyzed under strict scrutiny. Pp. 10–18.&para;<br>(1) The Act is not content based simply because it establishes&para;<br>buffer zones only at abortion clinics, as opposed to other kinds of fa­&para;<br>cilities. First, the Act does not draw content-based distinctions on its&para;<br>face. Whether petitioners violate the Act “depends” not “on what&para;<br>they say,” Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U. S. 1, 27, but&para;<br>on where they say it. Second, even if a facially neutral law dispropor­&para;<br>tionately affects speech on certain topics, it remains content neutral&para;<br>so long as it is “ ‘justified without reference to the content of the regu­&para;<br>lated speech.’ ” Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 48.&para;<br>The Act’s purposes include protecting public safety, patient access to&para;<br>healthcare, and unobstructed use of public sidewalks and streets.&para;<br>The Court has previously deemed all these concerns to be content&para;<br>neutral. See Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 321. An intent to single&para;<br>out for regulation speech about abortion cannot be inferred from the&para;<br>Act’s limited scope. “States adopt laws to address the problems that&para;<br>confront them.” Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 207. There was a&para;<br>record of crowding, obstruction, and even violence outside Massachu­&para;<br>setts abortion clinics but not at other kinds of facilities in the Com­&para;<br>monwealth. Pp. 11–15.&para;<br>(2) The Act’s exemption for clinic employees and agents acting&para;<br>within the scope of their employment does not appear to be an at­&para;<br>tempt to favor one viewpoint about abortion over the other. City of&para;<br>Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 51, distinguished. Given that some&para;<br>kind of exemption was necessary to allow individuals who work at&para;<br>the clinics to enter or remain within the buffer zones, the “scope of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>employment” qualification simply ensures that the exemption is lim­&para;<br>ited to its purpose of allowing the employees to do their jobs. Even&para;<br>assuming that some clinic escorts have expressed their views on&para;<br>abortion inside the zones, the record does not suggest that such&para;<br>speech was within the scope of the escorts’ employment. If it turned&para;<br>out that a particular clinic authorized its employees to speak about&para;<br>abortion in the buffer zones, that would support an as-applied chal­&para;<br>lenge to the zones at that clinic. Pp. 15–18.&para;<br>(c) Although the Act is content neutral, it is not “narrowly tailored”&para;<br>because it “burden[s] substantially more speech than is necessary to&para;<br>further the government’s legitimate interests.” Ward, 491 U. S., at&para;<br>799. Pp. 18–29.&para;<br>(1) The buffer zones serve the Commonwealth’s legitimate inter­&para;<br>ests in maintaining public safety on streets and sidewalks and in&para;<br>preserving access to adjacent reproductive healthcare facilities. See&para;<br>Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western N. Y., 519 U. S. 357, 376.&para;<br>At the same time, however, they impose serious burdens on petition­&para;<br>ers’ speech, depriving them of their two primary methods of com­&para;<br>municating with arriving patients: close, personal conversations and&para;<br>distribution of literature. Those forms of expression have historically&para;<br>been closely associated with the transmission of ideas. While the Act&para;<br>may allow petitioners to “protest” outside the buffer zones, petition­&para;<br>ers are not protestors; they seek not merely to express their opposi­&para;<br>tion to abortion, but to engage in personal, caring, consensual conver­&para;<br>sations with women about various alternatives. It is thus no answer&para;<br>to say that petitioners can still be seen and heard by women within&para;<br>the buffer zones. If all that the women can see and hear are vocifer­&para;<br>ous opponents of abortion, then the buffer zones have effectively sti­&para;<br>fled petitioners’ message. Pp. 19–23.&para;<br>(2) The buffer zones burden substantially more speech than nec­&para;<br>essary to achieve the Commonwealth’s asserted interests. Subsection&para;<br>(e) of the Act already prohibits deliberate obstruction of clinic en­&para;<br>trances. Massachusetts could also enact legislation similar to the&para;<br>federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994, 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§248(a)(1), which imposes criminal and civil sanctions for obstruct­&para;<br>ing, intimidating, or interfering with persons obtaining or providing&para;<br>reproductive health services. Obstruction of clinic driveways can&para;<br>readily be addressed through existing local traffic ordinances. While&para;<br>the Commonwealth contends that individuals can inadvertently ob­&para;<br>struct access to clinics simply by gathering in large numbers, that&para;<br>problem could be addressed through a law requiring crowds blocking&para;<br>a clinic entrance to disperse for a limited period when ordered to do&para;<br>so by the police. In any event, crowding appears to be a problem only&para;<br>at the Boston clinic, and even there, only on Saturday mornings.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v. COAKLEY&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>The Commonwealth has not shown that it seriously undertook to&para;<br>address these various problems with the less intrusive tools readily&para;<br>available to it. It identifies not a single prosecution or injunction&para;<br>against individuals outside abortion clinics since the 1990s. The&para;<br>Commonwealth responds that the problems are too widespread for&para;<br>individual prosecutions and injunctions to be effective. But again,&para;<br>the record indicates that the problems are limited principally to the&para;<br>Boston clinic on Saturday mornings, and the police there appear per­&para;<br>fectly capable of singling out lawbreakers. The Commonwealth also&para;<br>claims that it would be difficult to prove intentional or deliberate ob­&para;<br>struction or intimidation and that the buffer zones accordingly make&para;<br>the police’s job easier. To meet the narrow tailoring requirement,&para;<br>however, the government must demonstrate that alternative&para;<br>measures that burden substantially less speech would fail to achieve&para;<br>the government’s interests, not simply that the chosen route is easier.&para;<br>In any event, to determine whether someone intends to block access&para;<br>to a clinic, a police officer need only order him to move; if he refuses,&para;<br>then there is no question that his continued conduct is knowing or in­&para;<br>tentional. For similar reasons, the Commonwealth’s reliance on Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, is misplaced. There, the Court upheld&para;<br>a law establishing buffer zones outside polling places on the ground&para;<br>that less restrictive measures were inadequate. But whereas “[v]oter&para;<br>intimidation and election fraud” are “difficult to detect,” id., at 208,&para;<br>obstruction and harassment at abortion clinics are anything but sub­&para;<br>tle. And while the police “generally are barred from the vicinity of&para;<br>the polls to avoid any appearance of coercion in the electoral process,”&para;<br>id., at 207, they maintain a significant presence outside Massachu­&para;<br>setts abortion clinics. In short, given the vital First Amendment in­&para;<br>terests at stake, it is not enough for Massachusetts simply to say that&para;<br>other approaches have not worked.

Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266,&para;<br>§§120E½(a), (b) (West 2012). Petitioners are individuals&para;<br>who approach and talk to women outside such facilities,&para;<br>attempting to dissuade them from having abortions. The&para;<br>statute prevents petitioners from doing so near the facili­&para;<br>ties’ entrances. The question presented is whether the&para;<br>statute violates the First Amendment.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>In 2000, the Massachusetts Legislature enacted the&para;<br>Massachusetts Reproductive Health Care Facilities Act,&para;<br>Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½ (West 2000). The law&para;<br>was designed to address clashes between abortion oppo­&para;<br>nents and advocates of abortion rights that were occurring&para;<br>outside clinics where abortions were performed. The Act&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v. COAKLEY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>established a defined area with an 18-foot radius around&para;<br>the entrances and driveways of such facilities. §120E½(b).&para;<br>Anyone could enter that area, but once within it, no one&para;<br>(other than certain exempt individuals) could knowingly&para;<br>approach within six feet of another person—unless that&para;<br>person consented—“for the purpose of passing a leaflet or&para;<br>handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral pro­&para;<br>test, education, or counseling with such other person.”&para;<br>Ibid. A separate provision subjected to criminal punish­&para;<br>ment anyone who “knowingly obstructs, detains, hinders,&para;<br>impedes or blocks another person’s entry to or exit from a&para;<br>reproductive health care facility.” §120E½(e).&para;<br>The statute was modeled on a similar Colorado law that&para;<br>this Court had upheld in Hill v. Colorado, 530 U. S. 703&para;<br>(2000). Relying on Hill, the United States Court of Ap­&para;<br>peals for the First Circuit sustained the Massachusetts&para;<br>statute against a First Amendment challenge. McGuire v.&para;<br>Reilly, 386 F. 3d 45 (2004) (McGuire II), cert. denied, 544&para;<br>U. S. 974 (2005); McGuire v. Reilly, 260 F. 3d 36 (2001)&para;<br>(McGuire I).&para;<br>By 2007, some Massachusetts legislators and law en­&para;<br>forcement officials had come to regard the 2000 statute as&para;<br>inadequate. At legislative hearings, multiple witnesses&para;<br>recounted apparent violations of the law. Massachusetts&para;<br>Attorney General Martha Coakley, for example, testified&para;<br>that protestors violated the statute “on a routine basis.”&para;<br>App. 78. To illustrate this claim, she played a video de­&para;<br>picting protestors approaching patients and clinic staff&para;<br>within the buffer zones, ostensibly without the latter&para;<br>individuals’ consent. Clinic employees and volunteers also&para;<br>testified that protestors congregated near the doors and in&para;<br>the driveways of the clinics, with the result that prospec­&para;<br>tive patients occasionally retreated from the clinics rather&para;<br>than try to make their way to the clinic entrances or park­&para;<br>ing lots.&para;<br>Captain William B. Evans of the Boston Police Depart­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ment, however, testified that his officers had made “no&para;<br>more than five or so arrests” at the Planned Parenthood&para;<br>clinic in Boston and that what few prosecutions had been&para;<br>brought were unsuccessful. Id., at 68–69. Witnesses&para;<br>attributed the dearth of enforcement to the difficulty of&para;<br>policing the six-foot no-approach zones. Captain Evans&para;<br>testified that the 18-foot zones were so crowded with&para;<br>protestors that they resembled “a goalie’s crease,” making&para;<br>it hard to determine whether a protestor had deliberately&para;<br>approached a patient or, if so, whether the patient had&para;<br>consented. Id., at 69–71. For similar reasons, Attorney&para;<br>General Coakley concluded that the six-foot no-approach&para;<br>zones were “unenforceable.” Id., at 79. What the police&para;<br>needed, she said, was a fixed buffer zone around clinics&para;<br>that protestors could not enter. Id., at 74, 76. Captain&para;<br>Evans agreed, explaining that such a zone would “make&para;<br>our job so much easier.” Id., at 68.&para;<br>To address these concerns, the Massachusetts Legisla­&para;<br>ture amended the statute in 2007, replacing the six-foot&para;<br>no-approach zones (within the 18-foot area) with a 35-foot&para;<br>fixed buffer zone from which individuals are categorically&para;<br>excluded. The statute now provides:&para;<br>“No person shall knowingly enter or remain on a pub­&para;<br>lic way or sidewalk adjacent to a reproductive health&para;<br>care facility within a radius of 35 feet of any portion of&para;<br>an entrance, exit or driveway of a reproductive health&para;<br>care facility or within the area within a rectangle cre­&para;<br>ated by extending the outside boundaries of any en­&para;<br>trance, exit or driveway of a reproductive health care&para;<br>facility in straight lines to the point where such lines&para;<br>intersect the sideline of the street in front of such en­&para;<br>trance, exit or driveway.” Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266,&para;<br>§120E½(b) (West 2012).&para;<br>A “reproductive health care facility,” in turn, is defined as&para;<br>“a place, other than within or upon the grounds of a hospi­&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v. COAKLEY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tal, where abortions are offered or performed.” §120E½(a).&para;<br>The 35-foot buffer zone applies only “during a facility’s&para;<br>business hours,” and the area must be “clearly marked&para;<br>and posted.” §120E½(c). In practice, facilities typically&para;<br>mark the zones with painted arcs and posted signs on&para;<br>adjacent sidewalks and streets. A first violation of the&para;<br>statute is punishable by a fine of up to $500, up to three&para;<br>months in prison, or both, while a subsequent offense is&para;<br>punishable by a fine of between $500 and $5,000, up to&para;<br>two and a half years in prison, or both. §120E½(d).&para;<br>The Act exempts four classes of individuals: (1) “persons&para;<br>entering or leaving such facility”; (2) “employees or agents&para;<br>of such facility acting within the scope of their employ­&para;<br>ment”; (3) “law enforcement, ambulance, firefighting,&para;<br>construction, utilities, public works and other municipal&para;<br>agents acting within the scope of their employment”; and&para;<br>(4) “persons using the public sidewalk or street rightof-way adjacent to such facility solely for the purpose&para;<br>of reaching a destination other than such facility.”&para;<br>§120E½(b)(1)–(4). The legislature also retained the sepa­&para;<br>rate provision from the 2000 version that proscribes the&para;<br>knowing obstruction of access to a facility. §120E½(e).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Some of the individuals who stand outside Massachu­&para;<br>setts abortion clinics are fairly described as protestors,&para;<br>who express their moral or religious opposition to abortion&para;<br>through signs and chants or, in some cases, more aggres­&para;<br>sive methods such as face-to-face confrontation. Petition­&para;<br>ers take a different tack. They attempt to engage women&para;<br>approaching the clinics in what they call “sidewalk coun­&para;<br>seling,” which involves offering information about alterna­&para;<br>tives to abortion and help pursuing those options. Peti­&para;<br>tioner Eleanor McCullen, for instance, will typically&para;<br>initiate a conversation this way: “Good morning, may I&para;<br>give you my literature? Is there anything I can do for you?&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I’m available if you have any questions.” App. 138. If the&para;<br>woman seems receptive, McCullen will provide additional&para;<br>information. McCullen and the other petitioners consider&para;<br>it essential to maintain a caring demeanor, a calm tone of&para;<br>voice, and direct eye contact during these exchanges.&para;<br>Such interactions, petitioners believe, are a much more&para;<br>effective means of dissuading women from having abor­&para;<br>tions than confrontational methods such as shouting or&para;<br>brandishing signs, which in petitioners’ view tend only to&para;<br>antagonize their intended audience. In unrefuted testi­&para;<br>mony, petitioners say they have collectively persuaded&para;<br>hundreds of women to forgo abortions.&para;<br>The buffer zones have displaced petitioners from their&para;<br>previous positions outside the clinics. McCullen offers&para;<br>counseling outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Boston,&para;<br>as do petitioners Jean Zarrella and Eric Cadin. Petitioner&para;<br>Gregory Smith prays the rosary there. The clinic occupies&para;<br>its own building on a street corner. Its main door is re­&para;<br>cessed into an open foyer, approximately 12 feet back from&para;<br>the public sidewalk. Before the Act was amended to cre­&para;<br>ate the buffer zones, petitioners stood near the entryway&para;<br>to the foyer. Now a buffer zone—marked by a painted arc&para;<br>and a sign—surrounds the entrance. This zone extends 23&para;<br>feet down the sidewalk in one direction, 26 feet in the&para;<br>other, and outward just one foot short of the curb. The&para;<br>clinic’s entrance adds another seven feet to the width of&para;<br>the zone. Id., at 293–295. The upshot is that petitioners&para;<br>are effectively excluded from a 56-foot-wide expanse of the&para;<br>public sidewalk in front of the clinic.1&para;<br>Petitioners Mark Bashour and Nancy Clark offer coun­&para;<br>seling and information outside a Planned Parenthood&para;<br>clinic in Worcester. Unlike the Boston clinic, the Worces­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The zone could have extended an additional 21 feet in width under&para;<br>the Act. Only the smaller area was marked off, however, so only that&para;<br>area has legal effect. See Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½(c).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v. COAKLEY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ter clinic sits well back from the public street and side­&para;<br>walks. Patients enter the clinic in one of two ways. Those&para;<br>arriving on foot turn off the public sidewalk and walk&para;<br>down a nearly 54-foot-long private walkway to the main&para;<br>entrance. More than 85% of patients, however, arrive by&para;<br>car, turning onto the clinic’s driveway from the street,&para;<br>parking in a private lot, and walking to the main entrance&para;<br>on a private walkway.&para;<br>Bashour and Clark would like to stand where the pri­&para;<br>vate walkway or driveway intersects the sidewalk and&para;<br>offer leaflets to patients as they walk or drive by. But a&para;<br>painted arc extends from the private walkway 35 feet&para;<br>down the sidewalk in either direction and outward nearly&para;<br>to the curb on the opposite side of the street. Another arc&para;<br>surrounds the driveway’s entrance, covering more than 93&para;<br>feet of the sidewalk (including the width of the driveway)&para;<br>and extending across the street and nearly six feet onto&para;<br>the sidewalk on the opposite side. Id., at 295–297. Bash­&para;<br>our and Clark must now stand either some distance down&para;<br>the sidewalk from the private walkway and driveway or&para;<br>across the street.&para;<br>Petitioner Cyril Shea stands outside a Planned&para;<br>Parenthood clinic in Springfield, which, like the Worcester&para;<br>clinic, is set back from the public streets. Approximately&para;<br>90% of patients arrive by car and park in the private lots&para;<br>surrounding the clinic. Shea used to position himself at&para;<br>an entrance to one of the five driveways leading to the&para;<br>parking lots. Painted arcs now surround the entrances,&para;<br>each spanning approximately 100 feet of the sidewalk&para;<br>parallel to the street (again, including the width of the&para;<br>driveways) and extending outward well into the street.&para;<br>Id., at 297–299. Like petitioners at the Worcester clinic,&para;<br>Shea now stands far down the sidewalk from the driveway&para;<br>entrances.&para;<br>Petitioners at all three clinics claim that the buffer&para;<br>zones have considerably hampered their counseling ef­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>forts. Although they have managed to conduct some coun­&para;<br>seling and to distribute some literature outside the buffer&para;<br>zones—particularly at the Boston clinic—they say they&para;<br>have had many fewer conversations and distributed many&para;<br>fewer leaflets since the zones went into effect. Id., at 136–&para;<br>137, 180, 200.&para;<br>The second statutory exemption allows clinic employees&para;<br>and agents acting within the scope of their employment to&para;<br>enter the buffer zones. Relying on this exemption, the&para;<br>Boston clinic uses “escorts” to greet women as they ap­&para;<br>proach the clinic, accompanying them through the zones to&para;<br>the clinic entrance. Petitioners claim that the escorts&para;<br>sometimes thwart petitioners’ attempts to communicate&para;<br>with patients by blocking petitioners from handing litera­&para;<br>ture to patients, telling patients not to “pay any attention”&para;<br>or “listen to” petitioners, and disparaging petitioners as&para;<br>“crazy.” Id., at 165, 178.&para;<br>C&para;<br>In January 2008, petitioners sued Attorney General&para;<br>Coakley and other Commonwealth officials. They sought&para;<br>to enjoin enforcement of the Act, alleging that it violates&para;<br>the First and Fourteenth Amendments, both on its face&para;<br>and as applied to them.

Such areas occupy&para;<br>a “special position in terms of First Amendment protec­&para;<br>tion” because of their historic role as sites for discussion&para;<br>and debate. United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 180&para;<br>(1983). These places—which we have labeled “traditional&para;<br>public fora”—“ ‘have immemorially been held in trust for&para;<br>the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used&para;<br>for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts be­&para;<br>tween citizens, and discussing public questions.’ ” Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460, 469 (2009)&para;<br>(quoting Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators’ Assn.,&para;<br>460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983)).&para;<br>It is no accident that public streets and sidewalks have&para;<br>developed as venues for the exchange of ideas. Even&para;<br>today, they remain one of the few places where a speaker&para;<br>can be confident that he is not simply preaching to the&para;<br>choir. With respect to other means of communication, an&para;<br>individual confronted with an uncomfortable message can&para;<br>always turn the page, change the channel, or leave the&para;<br>Web site. Not so on public streets and sidewalks. There, a&para;<br>listener often encounters speech he might otherwise tune&para;<br>out. In light of the First Amendment’s purpose “to pre­&para;<br>serve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>will ultimately prevail,” FCC v. League of Women Voters of&para;<br>Cal., 468 U. S. 364, 377 (1984) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted), this aspect of traditional public fora is a virtue,&para;<br>not a vice.&para;<br>In short, traditional public fora are areas that have&para;<br>historically been open to the public for speech activities.&para;<br>Thus, even though the Act says nothing about speech on&para;<br>its face, there is no doubt—and respondents do not dis­&para;<br>pute—that it restricts access to traditional public fora and&para;<br>is therefore subject to First Amendment scrutiny. See&para;<br>Brief for Respondents 26 (although “[b]y its terms, the Act&para;<br>regulates only conduct,” it “incidentally regulates the&para;<br>place and time of protected speech”).&para;<br>Consistent with the traditionally open character of&para;<br>public streets and sidewalks, we have held that the gov­&para;<br>ernment’s ability to restrict speech in such locations is&para;<br>“very limited.” Grace, supra, at 177. In particular, the&para;<br>guiding First Amendment principle that the “government&para;<br>has no power to restrict expression because of its message,&para;<br>its ideas, its subject matter, or its content” applies with&para;<br>full force in a traditional public forum. Police Dept. of&para;<br>Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 (1972). As a general&para;<br>rule, in such a forum the government may not “selectively&para;<br>. . . shield the public from some kinds of speech on the&para;<br>ground that they are more offensive than others.”&para;<br>Erznoznik v. Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 209 (1975).&para;<br>We have, however, afforded the government somewhat&para;<br>wider leeway to regulate features of speech unrelated to&para;<br>its content. “[E]ven in a public forum the government may&para;<br>impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or man­&para;<br>ner of protected speech, provided the restrictions ‘are&para;<br>justified without reference to the content of the regulated&para;<br>speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a signifi­&para;<br>cant governmental interest, and that they leave open&para;<br>ample alternative channels for communication of the&para;<br>information.’ ” Ward, 491 U. S., at 791 (quoting Clark v.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v. COAKLEY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293&para;<br>(1984)).2&para;<br>While the parties agree that this test supplies the&para;<br>proper framework for assessing the constitutionality of the&para;<br>Massachusetts Act, they disagree about whether the Act&para;<br>satisfies the test’s three requirements.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Petitioners contend that the Act is not content neutral&para;<br>for two independent reasons: First, they argue that it&para;<br>discriminates against abortion-related speech because it&para;<br>establishes buffer zones only at clinics that perform abor­&para;<br>tions. Second, petitioners contend that the Act, by ex­&para;<br>empting clinic employees and agents, favors one viewpoint&para;<br>about abortion over the other. If either of these argu­&para;<br>ments is correct, then the Act must satisfy strict scruti­&para;<br>ny—that is, it must be the least restrictive means of&para;<br>achieving a compelling state interest. See United States v.&para;<br>Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 813&para;<br>(2000). Respondents do not argue that the Act can survive&para;<br>this exacting standard.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA objects to our decision to consider&para;<br>whether the statute is content based and thus subject to&para;<br>strict scrutiny, given that we ultimately conclude that it is&para;<br>not narrowly tailored. Post, at 2 (opinion concurring in&para;<br>judgment). But we think it unexceptional to perform the&para;<br>first part of a multipart constitutional analysis first. The&para;<br>content-neutrality prong of the Ward test is logically&para;<br>antecedent to the narrow-tailoring prong, because it de­&para;<br>termines the appropriate level of scrutiny. It is not unu­&para;<br>sual for the Court to proceed sequentially in applying a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 A different analysis would of course be required if the government&para;<br>property at issue were not a traditional public forum but instead “a&para;<br>forum that is limited to use by certain groups or dedicated solely to the&para;<br>discussion of certain subjects.” Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555&para;<br>U. S. 460, 470 (2009).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>constitutional test, even when the preliminary steps turn&para;<br>out not to be dispositive. See, e.g., Bartnicki v. Vopper,&para;<br>532 U. S. 514, 526–527 (2001); Holder v. Humanitarian&para;<br>Law Project, 561 U. S. 1, 25–28 (2010) (concluding that a&para;<br>law was content based even though it ultimately survived&para;<br>strict scrutiny).&para;<br>The Court does sometimes assume, without deciding,&para;<br>that a law is subject to a less stringent level of scrutiny, as&para;<br>we did earlier this Term in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (plurality opin­&para;<br>ion) (slip op., at 10). But the distinction between that case&para;<br>and this one seems clear: Applying any standard of review&para;<br>other than intermediate scrutiny in McCutcheon—the&para;<br>standard that was assumed to apply—would have re­&para;<br>quired overruling a precedent. There is no similar reason&para;<br>to forgo the ordinary order of operations in this case.&para;<br>At the same time, there is good reason to address con­&para;<br>tent neutrality. In discussing whether the Act is narrowly&para;<br>tailored, see Part IV, infra, we identify a number of less­&para;<br>restrictive alternative measures that the Massachusetts&para;<br>Legislature might have adopted. Some apply only at&para;<br>abortion clinics, which raises the question whether those&para;<br>provisions are content neutral. See infra, at 12–15. While&para;<br>we need not (and do not) endorse any of those measures, it&para;<br>would be odd to consider them as possible alternatives if&para;<br>they were presumptively unconstitutional because they&para;<br>were content based and thus subject to strict scrutiny.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Act applies only at a “reproductive health care&para;<br>facility,” defined as “a place, other than within or upon the&para;<br>grounds of a hospital, where abortions are offered or per­&para;<br>formed.” Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½(a). Given&para;<br>this definition, petitioners argue, “virtually all speech&para;<br>affected by the Act is speech concerning abortion,” thus&para;<br>rendering the Act content based. Brief for Petitioners 23.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v. COAKLEY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We disagree. To begin, the Act does not draw content­&para;<br>based distinctions on its face. Contrast Boos v. Barry, 485&para;<br>U. S. 312, 315 (1988) (ordinance prohibiting the display&para;<br>within 500 feet of a foreign embassy of any sign that tends&para;<br>to bring the foreign government into “ ‘public odium’ ” or&para;<br>“ ‘public disrepute’ ”); Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 465&para;<br>(1980) (statute prohibiting all residential picketing except&para;<br>“peaceful labor picketing”). The Act would be content&para;<br>based if it required “enforcement authorities” to “examine&para;<br>the content of the message that is conveyed to determine&para;<br>whether” a violation has occurred. League of Women&para;<br>Voters of Cal., supra, at 383. But it does not. Whether&para;<br>petitioners violate the Act “depends” not “on what they&para;<br>say,” Humanitarian Law Project, supra, at 27, but simply&para;<br>on where they say it. Indeed, petitioners can violate the&para;<br>Act merely by standing in a buffer zone, without display­&para;<br>ing a sign or uttering a word.&para;<br>It is true, of course, that by limiting the buffer zones to&para;<br>abortion clinics, the Act has the “inevitable effect” of re­&para;<br>stricting abortion-related speech more than speech on&para;<br>other subjects. Brief for Petitioners 24 (quoting United&para;<br>States v. O’Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 384 (1968)). But a facially&para;<br>neutral law does not become content based simply because it may disproportionately affect speech on certain&para;<br>topics. On the contrary, “[a] regulation that serves pur­&para;<br>poses unrelated to the content of expression is deemed&para;<br>neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speak­&para;<br>ers or messages but not others.” Ward, supra, at 791. The&para;<br>question in such a case is whether the law is “ ‘justified&para;<br>without reference to the content of the regulated speech.’ ”&para;<br>Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.

Respondents have&para;<br>articulated similar purposes before this Court—namely,&para;<br>“public safety, patient access to healthcare, and the unob­&para;<br>structed use of public sidewalks and roadways.” Brief for&para;<br>Respondents 27; see, e.g., App. 51 (testimony of Attorney&para;<br>General Coakley); id., at 67–70 (testimony of Captain&para;<br>William B. Evans of the Boston Police); id., at 79–80 (tes­&para;<br>timony of Mary Beth Heffernan, Undersecretary for Crim­&para;<br>inal Justice); id., at 122–124 (affidavit of Captain Evans).&para;<br>It is not the case that “[e]very objective indication shows&para;<br>that the provision’s primary purpose is to restrict speech&para;<br>that opposes abortion.” Post, at 7.&para;<br>We have previously deemed the foregoing concerns to be&para;<br>content neutral. See Boos, 485 U. S., at 321 (identifying&para;<br>“congestion,” “interference with ingress or egress,” and&para;<br>“the need to protect . . . security” as content-neutral con­&para;<br>cerns). Obstructed access and congested sidewalks are&para;<br>problems no matter what caused them. A group of indi­&para;<br>viduals can obstruct clinic access and clog sidewalks just&para;<br>as much when they loiter as when they protest abortion or&para;<br>counsel patients.&para;<br>To be clear, the Act would not be content neutral if it&para;<br>were concerned with undesirable effects that arise from&para;<br>“the direct impact of speech on its audience” or “[l]isteners’&para;<br>reactions to speech.” Ibid. If, for example, the speech&para;<br>outside Massachusetts abortion clinics caused offense or&para;<br>made listeners uncomfortable, such offense or discomfort&para;<br>would not give the Commonwealth a content-neutral&para;<br>justification to restrict the speech. All of the problems&para;<br>identified by the Commonwealth here, however, arise&para;<br>irrespective of any listener’s reactions. Whether or not a&para;<br>single person reacts to abortion protestors’ chants or peti­&para;<br>tioners’ counseling, large crowds outside abortion clinics&para;<br>can still compromise public safety, impede access, and&para;<br>obstruct sidewalks.&para;<br>Petitioners do not really dispute that the Common­&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v. COAKLEY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>wealth’s interests in ensuring safety and preventing ob­&para;<br>struction are, as a general matter, content neutral. But&para;<br>petitioners note that these interests “apply outside every&para;<br>building in the State that hosts any activity that might&para;<br>occasion protest or comment,” not just abortion clinics.&para;<br>Brief for Petitioners 24. By choosing to pursue these&para;<br>interests only at abortion clinics, petitioners argue, the&para;<br>Massachusetts Legislature evinced a purpose to “single[ ]&para;<br>out for regulation speech about one particular topic: abor­&para;<br>tion.” Reply Brief 9.&para;<br>We cannot infer such a purpose from the Act’s limited&para;<br>scope. The broad reach of a statute can help confirm that&para;<br>it was not enacted to burden a narrower category of disfa­&para;<br>vored speech. See Kagan, Private Speech, Public Purpose:&para;<br>The Role of Governmental Motive in First Amendment&para;<br>Doctrine, 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 413, 451–452 (1996). At the&para;<br>same time, however, “States adopt laws to address the&para;<br>problems that confront them. The First Amendment does&para;<br>not require States to regulate for problems that do not&para;<br>exist.” Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 207 (1992)&para;<br>(plurality opinion).&para;<br>The Massachusetts Legislature&para;<br>amended the Act in 2007 in response to a problem that&para;<br>was, in its experience, limited to abortion clinics. There&para;<br>was a record of crowding, obstruction, and even violence&para;<br>outside such clinics. There were apparently no similar&para;<br>recurring problems associated with other kinds of&para;<br>healthcare facilities, let alone with “every building in the&para;<br>State that hosts any activity that might occasion protest&para;<br>or comment.” Brief for Petitioners 24. In light of the&para;<br>limited nature of the problem, it was reasonable for the&para;<br>Massachusetts Legislature to enact a limited solution.&para;<br>When selecting among various options for combating a&para;<br>particular problem, legislatures should be encouraged to&para;<br>choose the one that restricts less speech, not more.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA objects that the statute does restrict&para;<br>more speech than necessary, because “only one [Massa­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>chusetts abortion clinic] is known to have been beset by&para;<br>the problems that the statute supposedly addresses.”&para;<br>Post, at 7. But there are no grounds for inferring content­&para;<br>based discrimination here simply because the legislature&para;<br>acted with respect to abortion facilities generally rather&para;<br>than proceeding on a facility-by-facility basis. On these&para;<br>facts, the poor fit noted by JUSTICE SCALIA goes to the&para;<br>question of narrow tailoring, which we consider below.&para;<br>See infra, at 26–28.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Petitioners also argue that the Act is content based&para;<br>because it exempts four classes of individuals, Mass. Gen.&para;<br>Laws, ch. 266, §§120E½(b)(1)–(4), one of which comprises&para;<br>“employees or agents of [a reproductive healthcare] facility acting within the scope of their employment.”&para;<br>§120E½(b)(2). This exemption, petitioners say, favors one&para;<br>side in the abortion debate and thus constitutes viewpoint&para;<br>discrimination—an “egregious form of content discrimina­&para;<br>tion,” Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,&para;<br>515 U. S. 819, 829 (1995). In particular, petitioners argue&para;<br>that the exemption allows clinic employees and agents—&para;<br>including the volunteers who “escort” patients arriving at&para;<br>the Boston clinic—to speak inside the buffer zones.&para;<br>It is of course true that “an exemption from an other­&para;<br>wise permissible regulation of speech may represent a&para;<br>governmental ‘attempt to give one side of a debatable&para;<br>public question an advantage in expressing its views to&para;<br>the people.’ ” City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 51&para;<br>(1994) (quoting First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435&para;<br>U. S. 765, 785–786 (1978)). At least on the record before&para;<br>us, however, the statutory exemption for clinic employees&para;<br>and agents acting within the scope of their employment&para;<br>does not appear to be such an attempt.&para;<br>There is nothing inherently suspect about providing&para;<br>some kind of exemption to allow individuals who work at&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v. COAKLEY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the clinics to enter or remain within the buffer zones. In&para;<br>particular, the exemption cannot be regarded as simply a&para;<br>carve-out for the clinic escorts; it also covers employees&para;<br>such as the maintenance worker shoveling a snowy side­&para;<br>walk or the security guard patrolling a clinic entrance, see&para;<br>App. 95 (affidavit of Michael T. Baniukiewicz).&para;<br>Given the need for an exemption for clinic employees,&para;<br>the “scope of their employment” qualification simply en­&para;<br>sures that the exemption is limited to its purpose of allow­&para;<br>ing the employees to do their jobs. It performs the same&para;<br>function as the identical “scope of their employment”&para;<br>restriction on the exemption for “law enforcement, ambu­&para;<br>lance, fire-fighting, construction, utilities, public works&para;<br>and other municipal agents.” §120E½(b)(3). Contrary to&para;<br>the suggestion of JUSTICE SCALIA, post, at 11–12, there is&para;<br>little reason to suppose that the Massachusetts Legisla­&para;<br>ture intended to incorporate a common law doctrine devel­&para;<br>oped for determining vicarious liability in tort when it&para;<br>used the phrase “scope of their employment” for the wholly&para;<br>different purpose of defining the scope of an exemption to&para;<br>a criminal statute. The limitation instead makes clear—&para;<br>with respect to both clinic employees and municipal&para;<br>agents—that exempted individuals are allowed inside the&para;<br>zones only to perform those acts authorized by their em­&para;<br>ployers. There is no suggestion in the record that any of&para;<br>the clinics authorize their employees to speak about abor­&para;<br>tion in the buffer zones. The “scope of their employment”&para;<br>limitation thus seems designed to protect against exactly&para;<br>the sort of conduct that petitioners and JUSTICE SCALIA&para;<br>fear.&para;<br>Petitioners did testify in this litigation about instances&para;<br>in which escorts at the Boston clinic had expressed views&para;<br>about abortion to the women they were accompanying,&para;<br>thwarted petitioners’ attempts to speak and hand litera­&para;<br>ture to the women, and disparaged petitioners in various&para;<br>ways. See App. 165, 168–169, 177–178, 189–190. It is&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>unclear from petitioners’ testimony whether these alleged&para;<br>incidents occurred within the buffer zones. There is no&para;<br>viewpoint discrimination problem if the incidents occurred&para;<br>outside the zones because petitioners are equally free to&para;<br>say whatever they would like in that area.&para;<br>Even assuming the incidents occurred inside the zones,&para;<br>the record does not suggest that they involved speech&para;<br>within the scope of the escorts’ employment. If the speech&para;<br>was beyond the scope of their employment, then each of&para;<br>the alleged incidents would violate the Act’s express&para;<br>terms. Petitioners’ complaint would then be that the&para;<br>police were failing to enforce the Act equally against clinic&para;<br>escorts. Cf. Hoye v. City of Oakland, 653 F. 3d 835, 849–&para;<br>852 (CA9 2011) (finding selective enforcement of a similar&para;<br>ordinance in Oakland, California). While such allegations&para;<br>might state a claim of official viewpoint discrimination,&para;<br>that would not go to the validity of the Act. In any event,&para;<br>petitioners nowhere allege selective enforcement.&para;<br>It would be a very different question if it turned out that&para;<br>a clinic authorized escorts to speak about abortion inside&para;<br>the buffer zones. See post, at 1–2 (ALITO, J., concurring in&para;<br>judgment). In that case, the escorts would not seem to be&para;<br>violating the Act because the speech would be within the&para;<br>scope of their employment.3 The Act’s exemption for clinic&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Less than two weeks after the instant litigation was initiated, the&para;<br>Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office issued a guidance letter&para;<br>clarifying the application of the four exemptions. The letter interpreted&para;<br>the exemptions as not permitting clinic employees or agents, municipal&para;<br>employees or agents, or individuals passing by clinics “to express their&para;<br>views about abortion or to engage in any other partisan speech within&para;<br>the buffer zone.” App. 93, 93–94. While this interpretation supports&para;<br>our conclusion that the employee exemption does not render the Act&para;<br>viewpoint based, we do not consider it in our analysis because it ap­&para;<br>pears to broaden the scope of the Act—a criminal statute—rather than&para;<br>to adopt a “ ‘limiting construction.’ ” Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491&para;<br>U. S. 781, 796 (1989) (quoting Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman&para;<br>Estates, Inc., 455 U.

COAKLEY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>employees would then facilitate speech on only one side of&para;<br>the abortion debate—a clear form of viewpoint discrimina­&para;<br>tion that would support an as-applied challenge to the&para;<br>buffer zone at that clinic. But the record before us con­&para;<br>tains insufficient evidence to show that the exemption&para;<br>operates in this way at any of the clinics, perhaps because&para;<br>the clinics do not want to doom the Act by allowing their&para;<br>employees to speak about abortion within the buffer&para;<br>zones.4&para;<br>We thus conclude that the Act is neither content nor&para;<br>viewpoint based and therefore need not be analyzed under&para;<br>strict scrutiny.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Even though the Act is content neutral, it still must be&para;<br>“narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental&para;<br>interest.” Ward, 491 U. S., at 796 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). The tailoring requirement does not sim­&para;<br>ply guard against an impermissible desire to censor. The&para;<br>government may attempt to suppress speech not only&para;<br>because it disagrees with the message being expressed,&para;<br>but also for mere convenience. Where certain speech is&para;<br>associated with particular problems, silencing the speech&para;<br>is sometimes the path of least resistance. But by demand­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Of course we do not hold that “[s]peech restrictions favoring one&para;<br>viewpoint over another are not content based unless it can be shown&para;<br>that the favored viewpoint has actually been expressed.” Post, at 13.&para;<br>We instead apply an uncontroversial principle of constitutional adjudi­&para;<br>cation: that a plaintiff generally cannot prevail on an as-applied chal­&para;<br>lenge without showing that the law has in fact been (or is sufficiently&para;<br>likely to be) unconstitutionally applied to him. Specifically, when&para;<br>someone challenges a law as viewpoint discriminatory but it is not clear&para;<br>from the face of the law which speakers will be allowed to speak, he&para;<br>must show that he was prevented from speaking while someone espous­&para;<br>ing another viewpoint was permitted to do so. JUSTICE SCALIA can&para;<br>decry this analysis as “astonishing” only by quoting a sentence that is&para;<br>explicitly limited to as-applied challenges and treating it as relevant to&para;<br>facial challenges.

Such a&para;<br>regulation, unlike a content-based restriction of speech,&para;<br>“need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means&para;<br>of ” serving the government’s interests.

Petitioners do not dispute the signifi­&para;<br>cance of these interests. We have, moreover, previously&para;<br>recognized the legitimacy of the government’s interests in&para;<br>“ensuring public safety and order, promoting the free flow&para;<br>of traffic on streets and sidewalks, protecting property&para;<br>rights, and protecting a woman’s freedom to seek pregnancy­&para;<br>related services.”&para;<br>Schenck v.

The buffer zones clearly serve these interests.&para;<br>At the same time, the buffer zones impose serious bur­&para;<br>dens on petitioners’ speech. At each of the three Planned&para;<br>Parenthood clinics where petitioners attempt to counsel&para;<br>patients, the zones carve out a significant portion of the&para;<br>adjacent public sidewalks, pushing petitioners well back&para;<br>from the clinics’ entrances and driveways. The zones&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v. COAKLEY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>thereby compromise petitioners’ ability to initiate the&para;<br>close, personal conversations that they view as essential to&para;<br>“sidewalk counseling.”&para;<br>For example, in uncontradicted testimony, McCullen&para;<br>explained that she often cannot distinguish patients from&para;<br>passersby outside the Boston clinic in time to initiate a&para;<br>conversation before they enter the buffer zone. App. 135.&para;<br>And even when she does manage to begin a discussion&para;<br>outside the zone, she must stop abruptly at its painted&para;<br>border, which she believes causes her to appear “untrust­&para;<br>worthy” or “suspicious.” Id., at 135, 152. Given these&para;<br>limitations, McCullen is often reduced to raising her voice&para;<br>at patients from outside the zone—a mode of communica­&para;<br>tion sharply at odds with the compassionate message she&para;<br>wishes to convey. Id., at 133, 152–153. Clark gave similar&para;<br>testimony about her experience at the Worcester clinic.&para;<br>Id., at 243–244.&para;<br>These burdens on petitioners’ speech have clearly taken&para;<br>their toll. Although McCullen claims that she has per­&para;<br>suaded about 80 women not to terminate their pregnan­&para;<br>cies since the 2007 amendment, App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a,&para;<br>she also says that she reaches “far fewer people” than she&para;<br>did before the amendment, App. 137. Zarrella reports an&para;<br>even more precipitous decline in her success rate: She&para;<br>estimated having about 100 successful interactions over&para;<br>the years before the 2007 amendment, but not a single one&para;<br>since. Id., at 180. And as for the Worcester clinic, Clark&para;<br>testified that “only one woman out of 100 will make the&para;<br>effort to walk across [the street] to speak with [her].” Id.,&para;<br>at 217.&para;<br>The buffer zones have also made it substantially more&para;<br>difficult for petitioners to distribute literature to arriving&para;<br>patients. As explained, because petitioners in Boston&para;<br>cannot readily identify patients before they enter the zone,&para;<br>they often cannot approach them in time to place litera­&para;<br>ture near their hands—the most effective means of getting&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

In Worcester and&para;<br>Springfield, the zones have pushed petitioners so far back&para;<br>from the clinics’ driveways that they can no longer even&para;<br>attempt to offer literature as drivers turn into the parking&para;<br>lots. Id., at 213, 218, 252–253. In short, the Act operates&para;<br>to deprive petitioners of their two primary methods of&para;<br>communicating with patients.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals and respondents are wrong to&para;<br>downplay these burdens on petitioners’ speech. As the&para;<br>Court of Appeals saw it, the Constitution does not accord&para;<br>“special protection” to close conversations or “handbilling.”&para;<br>571 F. 3d, at 180. But while the First Amendment does&para;<br>not guarantee a speaker the right to any particular form of&para;<br>expression, some forms—such as normal conversation and&para;<br>leafletting on a public sidewalk—have historically been&para;<br>more closely associated with the transmission of ideas&para;<br>than others.&para;<br>In the context of petition campaigns, we have observed&para;<br>that “one-on-one communication” is “the most effective,&para;<br>fundamental, and perhaps economical avenue of political&para;<br>discourse.” Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 424 (1988). See&para;<br>also Schenck, supra, at 377 (invalidating a “floating”&para;<br>buffer zone around people entering an abortion clinic&para;<br>partly on the ground that it prevented protestors “from&para;<br>communicating a message from a normal conversational&para;<br>distance or handing leaflets to people entering or leaving&para;<br>the clinics who are walking on the public sidewalks”).

Brief for Respondents 50–54.&para;<br>That misses the point. Petitioners are not protestors.&para;<br>They seek not merely to express their opposition to abor­&para;<br>tion, but to inform women of various alternatives and to&para;<br>provide help in pursuing them. Petitioners believe that&para;<br>they can accomplish this objective only through personal,&para;<br>caring, consensual conversations. And for good reason: It&para;<br>is easier to ignore a strained voice or a waving hand than&para;<br>a direct greeting or an outstretched arm. While the record&para;<br>indicates that petitioners have been able to have a number&para;<br>of quiet conversations outside the buffer zones, respond­&para;<br>ents have not refuted petitioners’ testimony that the con­&para;<br>versations have been far less frequent and far less success­&para;<br>ful since the buffer zones were instituted. It is thus no&para;<br>answer to say that petitioners can still be “seen and&para;<br>heard” by women within the buffer zones. Id., at 51–53. If&para;<br>all that the women can see and hear are vociferous oppo­&para;<br>nents of abortion, then the buffer zones have effectively&para;<br>stifled petitioners’ message.&para;<br>Finally, respondents suggest that, at the Worcester and&para;<br>Springfield clinics, petitioners are prevented from com­&para;<br>municating with patients not by the buffer zones but by&para;<br>the fact that most patients arrive by car and park in the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 As&para;<br>&para;<br>a leading historian has noted:&para;<br>“It was in this form—as pamphlets—that much of the most important&para;<br>and characteristic writing of the American Revolution appeared.

It is true that the layout of&para;<br>the two clinics would prevent petitioners from approach­&para;<br>ing the clinics’ doorways, even without the buffer zones.&para;<br>But petitioners do not claim a right to trespass on the&para;<br>clinics’ property. They instead claim a right to stand on&para;<br>the public sidewalks by the driveway as cars turn into the&para;<br>parking lot. Before the buffer zones, they could do so.&para;<br>Now they must stand a substantial distance away. The&para;<br>Act alone is responsible for that restriction on their ability&para;<br>to convey their message.&para;<br>B&para;<br>1&para;<br>The buffer zones burden substantially more speech than&para;<br>necessary to achieve the Commonwealth’s asserted inter­&para;<br>ests. At the outset, we note that the Act is truly excep­&para;<br>tional: Respondents and their amici identify no other&para;<br>State with a law that creates fixed buffer zones around&para;<br>abortion clinics.6 That of course does not mean that the&para;<br>law is invalid. It does, however, raise concern that the&para;<br>Commonwealth has too readily forgone options that could&para;<br>serve its interests just as well, without substantially&para;<br>burdening the kind of speech in which petitioners wish to&para;<br>engage.&para;<br>That is the case here. The Commonwealth’s interests&para;<br>include ensuring public safety outside abortion clinics,&para;<br>preventing harassment and intimidation of patients and&para;<br>clinic staff, and combating deliberate obstruction of clinic&para;<br>entrances. The Act itself contains a separate provision,&para;<br>subsection (e)—unchallenged by petitioners—that prohib­&para;<br>its much of this conduct. That provision subjects to crimi­&para;<br>nal punishment “[a]ny person who knowingly obstructs,&para;<br>detains, hinders, impedes or blocks another person’s entry&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Amici do identify five localities with laws similar to the Act here.&para;<br>Brief for State of New York et al. as Amici Curiae 14, n. 7.&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v.

C. §248(a)(1), which subjects to both crimi­&para;<br>nal and civil penalties anyone who “by force or threat of&para;<br>force or by physical obstruction, intentionally injures,&para;<br>intimidates or interferes with or attempts to injure, intim­&para;<br>idate or interfere with any person because that person is&para;<br>or has been, or in order to intimidate such person or any&para;<br>other person or any class of persons from, obtaining or&para;<br>providing reproductive health services.” Some dozen other&para;<br>States have done so. See Brief for State of New York et al.&para;<br>as Amici Curiae 13, and n. 6. If the Commonwealth is&para;<br>particularly concerned about harassment, it could also&para;<br>consider an ordinance such as the one adopted in New&para;<br>York City that not only prohibits obstructing access to a&para;<br>clinic, but also makes it a crime “to follow and harass&para;<br>another person within 15 feet of the premises of a repro­&para;<br>ductive health care facility.” N.

Whether such a law would pass constitutional muster would&para;<br>depend on a number of other factors, such as whether the term “har­&para;<br>assment” had been authoritatively construed to avoid vagueness and&para;<br>overbreadth problems of the sort noted by JUSTICE SCALIA.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Any such obstruc­&para;<br>tion can readily be addressed through existing local ordi­&para;<br>nances. See, e.g., Worcester, Mass., Revised Ordinances of&para;<br>2008, ch. 12, §25(b) (“No person shall stand, or place any&para;<br>obstruction of any kind, upon any street, sidewalk or&para;<br>crosswalk in such a manner as to obstruct a free passage&para;<br>for travelers thereon”); Boston, Mass., Municipal Code, ch.&para;<br>16–41.2(d) (2013) (“No person shall solicit while walking&para;<br>on, standing on or going into any street or highway used&para;<br>for motor vehicle travel, or any area appurtenant thereto&para;<br>(including medians, shoulder areas, bicycle lanes, ramps&para;<br>and exit ramps)”).&para;<br>All of the foregoing measures are, of course, in addition&para;<br>to available generic criminal statutes forbidding assault,&para;<br>breach of the peace, trespass, vandalism, and the like.&para;<br>In addition, subsection (e) of the Act, the FACE Act, and&para;<br>the New York City anti-harassment ordinance are all&para;<br>enforceable not only through criminal prosecutions but&para;<br>also through public and private civil actions for injunc­&para;<br>tions and other equitable relief. See Mass. Gen. Laws&para;<br>§120E½(f); 18 U. S. C. §248(c)(1); N. Y. C. Admin. Code&para;<br>§§8–804, 8–805. We have previously noted the First&para;<br>Amendment virtues of targeted injunctions as alternatives&para;<br>to broad, prophylactic measures. Such an injunction&para;<br>“regulates the activities, and perhaps the speech, of a&para;<br>group,” but only “because of the group’s past actions in the&para;<br>context of a specific dispute between real parties.” Madsen, 512 U. S., at 762 (emphasis added). Moreover, given&para;<br>the equitable nature of injunctive relief, courts can tailor a&para;<br>remedy to ensure that it restricts no more speech than&para;<br>necessary. See, e.g., id., at 770; Schenck, 519 U. S., at&para;<br>380–381. In short, injunctive relief focuses on the precise&para;<br>individuals and the precise conduct causing a particular&para;<br>problem. The Act, by contrast, categorically excludes non­&para;<br>exempt individuals from the buffer zones, unnecessarily&para;<br>sweeping in innocent individuals and their speech.&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v. COAKLEY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The Commonwealth also asserts an interest in prevent­&para;<br>ing congestion in front of abortion clinics. According to&para;<br>respondents, even when individuals do not deliberately&para;<br>obstruct access to clinics, they can inadvertently do so&para;<br>simply by gathering in large numbers. But the Common­&para;<br>wealth could address that problem through more targeted&para;<br>means. Some localities, for example, have ordinances that&para;<br>require crowds blocking a clinic entrance to disperse when&para;<br>ordered to do so by the police, and that forbid the individ­&para;<br>uals to reassemble within a certain distance of the clinic&para;<br>for a certain period. See Brief for State of New York et al.&para;<br>as Amici Curiae 14–15, and n. 10. We upheld a similar&para;<br>law forbidding three or more people “ ‘to congregate within&para;<br>500 feet of [a foreign embassy], and refuse to disperse&para;<br>after having been ordered so to do by the police,’ ” Boos,&para;<br>485 U. S., at 316 (quoting D. C. Code §22–1115 (1938))—&para;<br>an order the police could give only when they “ ‘reasonably&para;<br>believe[d] that a threat to the security or peace of the&para;<br>embassy [was] present,’ ” 485 U. S., at 330 (quoting Finzer&para;<br>v. Barry, 798 F. 2d 1450, 1471 (CADC 1986)).&para;<br>And to the extent the Commonwealth argues that even&para;<br>these types of laws are ineffective, it has another problem.&para;<br>The portions of the record that respondents cite to support&para;<br>the anticongestion interest pertain mainly to one place at&para;<br>one time: the Boston Planned Parenthood clinic on Satur­&para;<br>day mornings. App. 69–71, 88–89, 96, 123. Respondents&para;<br>point us to no evidence that individuals regularly gather&para;<br>at other clinics, or at other times in Boston, in sufficiently&para;<br>large groups to obstruct access. For a problem shown to&para;<br>arise only once a week in one city at one clinic, creating&para;<br>35-foot buffer zones at every clinic across the Common­&para;<br>wealth is hardly a narrowly tailored solution.&para;<br>The point is not that Massachusetts must enact all or&para;<br>even any of the proposed measures discussed above. The&para;<br>point is instead that the Commonwealth has available to it&para;<br>a variety of approaches that appear capable of serving its&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

They also point to the Common­&para;<br>wealth’s experience under the 2000 version of the Act,&para;<br>during which the police found it difficult to enforce the six­&para;<br>foot no-approach zones given the “frenetic” activity in front&para;<br>of clinic entrances. Brief for Respondents 43. According to&para;<br>respondents, this history shows that Massachusetts has&para;<br>tried less restrictive alternatives to the buffer zones, to no&para;<br>avail.&para;<br>We cannot accept that contention. Although respond­&para;<br>ents claim that Massachusetts “tried other laws already&para;<br>on the books,” id., at 41, they identify not a single prosecu­&para;<br>tion brought under those laws within at least the last 17&para;<br>years. And while they also claim that the Commonwealth&para;<br>“tried injunctions,” ibid., the last injunctions they cite date&para;<br>to the 1990s, see id., at 42 (citing Planned Parenthood&para;<br>League of Mass., Inc. v. Bell, 424 Mass. 573, 677 N. E. 2d&para;<br>204 (1997); Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. v.&para;<br>Operation Rescue, 406 Mass. 701, 550 N. E. 2d 1361&para;<br>(1990)). In short, the Commonwealth has not shown that&para;<br>it seriously undertook to address the problem with less&para;<br>intrusive tools readily available to it. Nor has it shown&para;<br>that it considered different methods that other jurisdic­&para;<br>tions have found effective.&para;<br>Respondents contend that the alternatives we have&para;<br>discussed suffer from two defects: First, given the “wide­&para;<br>spread” nature of the problem, it is simply not “practica­&para;<br>ble” to rely on individual prosecutions and injunctions.&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v. COAKLEY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Brief for Respondents 45. But far from being “wide­&para;<br>spread,” the problem appears from the record to be limited&para;<br>principally to the Boston clinic on Saturday mornings.&para;<br>Moreover, by their own account, the police appear perfectly capable of singling out lawbreakers. The legislative&para;<br>testimony preceding the 2007 Act revealed substantial&para;<br>police and video monitoring at the clinics, especially when&para;<br>large gatherings were anticipated. Captain Evans testi­&para;<br>fied that his officers are so familiar with the scene outside&para;<br>the Boston clinic that they “know all the players down&para;<br>there.” App. 69. And Attorney General Coakley relied on&para;<br>video surveillance to show legislators conduct she thought&para;<br>was “clearly against the law.” Id., at 78. If Common­&para;<br>wealth officials can compile an extensive record of obstruc­&para;<br>tion and harassment to support their preferred legislation,&para;<br>we do not see why they cannot do the same to support&para;<br>injunctions and prosecutions against those who might&para;<br>deliberately flout the law.&para;<br>The second supposed defect in the alternatives we have&para;<br>identified is that laws like subsection (e) of the Act and the&para;<br>federal FACE Act require a showing of intentional or&para;<br>deliberate obstruction, intimidation, or harassment, which&para;<br>is often difficult to prove. Brief for Respondents 45–47.&para;<br>As Captain Evans predicted in his legislative testimony,&para;<br>fixed buffer zones would “make our job so much easier.”&para;<br>App. 68.&para;<br>Of course they would. But that is not enough to satisfy&para;<br>the First Amendment. To meet the requirement of narrow&para;<br>tailoring, the government must demonstrate that alterna­&para;<br>tive measures that burden substantially less speech would&para;<br>fail to achieve the government’s interests, not simply that&para;<br>the chosen route is easier. A painted line on the sidewalk&para;<br>is easy to enforce, but the prime objective of the First&para;<br>Amendment is not efficiency. In any case, we do not think&para;<br>that showing intentional obstruction is nearly so difficult&para;<br>in this context as respondents suggest. To determine&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Freeman is misplaced.

S., at 193–194. We approved the buffer&para;<br>zones as a valid prophylactic measure, noting that existing&para;<br>“[i]ntimidation and interference laws fall short of serving a&para;<br>State’s compelling interests because they ‘deal with only&para;<br>the most blatant and specific attempts’ to impede elec­&para;<br>tions.” Id., at 206–207 (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S.&para;<br>1, 28 (1976) (per curiam)). Such laws were insufficient&para;<br>because “[v]oter intimidation and election fraud are . . .&para;<br>difficult to detect.” Burson, 504 U. S., at 208. Obstruction&para;<br>of abortion clinics and harassment of patients, by contrast,&para;<br>are anything but subtle.&para;<br>We also noted in Burson that under state law, “law&para;<br>enforcement officers generally are barred from the vicinity&para;<br>of the polls to avoid any appearance of coercion in the&para;<br>electoral process,” with the result that “many acts of inter­&para;<br>ference would go undetected.” Id., at 207. Not so here.&para;<br>Again, the police maintain a significant presence outside&para;<br>Massachusetts abortion clinics. The buffer zones in Burson were justified because less restrictive measures were&para;<br>inadequate. Respondents have not shown that to be the&para;<br>case here.&para;<br>Given the vital First Amendment interests at stake, it is&para;<br>not enough for Massachusetts simply to say that other&para;<br>approaches have not worked.9&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Because we find that the Act is not narrowly tailored, we need not&para;<br>consider whether the Act leaves open ample alternative channels of&para;<br>&para;<br>30&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v.

The Court invites Massa­&para;<br>chusetts, as a means of satisfying the tailoring require­&para;<br>ment, to “consider an ordinance such as the one adopted in&para;<br>New York City that . . . makes it a crime ‘to follow and&para;<br>harass another person within 15 feet of the premises of a&para;<br>reproductive health care facility.’ ” Ante, at 24 (quoting&para;<br>N. Y. C. Admin. Code §8–803(a)(3) (2014)). Is it harass­&para;<br>ment, one wonders, for Eleanor McCullen to ask a woman,&para;<br>quietly and politely, two times, whether she will take&para;<br>literature or whether she has any questions?

It seems to me far from certain that First&para;<br>Amendment rights can be imperiled by threatening jail&para;<br>time (only at “reproductive health care facilit[ies],” of&para;<br>course) for so vague an offense as “follow[ing] and har­&para;<br>ass[ing].” It is wrong for the Court to give its approval to&para;<br>such legislation without benefit of briefing and argument.&para;<br>II.

S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>because it applies outside abortion clinics only (rather&para;<br>than outside other buildings as well).&para;<br>Public streets and sidewalks are traditional forums for&para;<br>speech on matters of public concern. Therefore, as the&para;<br>Court acknowledges, they hold a “ ‘special position in&para;<br>terms of First Amendment protection.’ ” Ante, at 8 (quot­&para;<br>ing United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 180 (1983)).&para;<br>Moreover, “the public spaces outside of [abortion­&para;<br>providing] facilities . . . ha[ve] become, by necessity and by&para;<br>virtue of this Court’s decisions, a forum of last resort for&para;<br>those who oppose abortion.” Hill, 530 U. S., at 763&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., dissenting). It blinks reality to say, as the&para;<br>majority does, that a blanket prohibition on the use of&para;<br>streets and sidewalks where speech on only one politically&para;<br>controversial topic is likely to occur—and where that&para;<br>speech can most effectively be communicated—is not&para;<br>content based. Would the Court exempt from strict scru­&para;<br>tiny a law banning access to the streets and sidewalks&para;<br>surrounding the site of the Republican National Conven­&para;<br>tion? Or those used annually to commemorate the 1965&para;<br>Selma-to-Montgomery civil rights marches? Or those&para;<br>outside the Internal Revenue Service? Surely not.&para;<br>The majority says, correctly enough, that a facially&para;<br>neutral speech restriction escapes strict scrutiny, even&para;<br>when it “may disproportionately affect speech on certain&para;<br>topics,” so long as it is “justified without reference to the&para;<br>content of the regulated speech.” Ante, at 12 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). But the cases in which the&para;<br>Court has previously found that standard satisfied—in&para;<br>particular, Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41&para;<br>(1986), and Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781&para;<br>(1989), both of which the majority cites—are a far cry from&para;<br>what confronts us here.&para;<br>Renton upheld a zoning ordinance prohibiting adult&para;<br>motion-picture theaters within 1,000 feet of residential&para;<br>neighborhoods, churches, parks, and schools. The ordi­&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v. COAKLEY&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>nance was content neutral, the Court held, because its&para;<br>purpose was not to suppress pornographic speech qua&para;<br>speech but, rather, to mitigate the “secondary effects” of&para;<br>adult theaters—including by “prevent[ing] crime, pro­&para;<br>tect[ing] the city’s retail trade, [and] maintain[ing] prop­&para;<br>erty values.” 475 U. S., at 47, 48. The Court reasoned that&para;<br>if the city “ ‘had been concerned with restricting the mes­&para;<br>sage purveyed by adult theaters, it would have tried to&para;<br>close them or restrict their number rather than circum­&para;<br>scribe their choice as to location.’ ” Id., at 48 (quoting&para;<br>Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50, 82,&para;<br>n. 4 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring in part)). Ward, in turn,&para;<br>involved a New York City regulation requiring the use of&para;<br>the city’s own sound equipment and technician for events&para;<br>at a bandshell in Central Park. The Court held the regu­&para;<br>lation content neutral because its “principal justification&para;<br>[was] the city’s desire to control noise levels,” a justifica­&para;<br>tion that “ ‘ha[d] nothing to do with [the] content’ ” of re­&para;<br>spondent’s rock concerts or of music more generally. 491&para;<br>U. S., at 792. The regulation “ha[d] no material impact on&para;<br>any performer’s ability to exercise complete artistic control&para;<br>over sound quality.” Id., at 802; see also id., at 792–793.&para;<br>Compare these cases’ reasons for concluding that the&para;<br>regulations in question were “justified without reference to&para;<br>the content of the regulated speech” with the feeble rea­&para;<br>sons for the majority’s adoption of that conclusion in the&para;<br>present case. The majority points only to the statute’s&para;<br>stated purpose of increasing “ ‘public safety’ ” at abortion&para;<br>clinics, ante, at 12–13 (quoting 2007 Mass. Acts p. 660),&para;<br>and to the additional aims articulated by respondents&para;<br>before this Court—namely, protecting “ ‘patient access to&para;<br>healthcare . . . and the unobstructed use of public side­&para;<br>walks and roadways,’ ” ante, at 13 (quoting Brief for Re­&para;<br>spondents 27). Really? Does a statute become “justified&para;<br>without reference to the content of the regulated speech”&para;<br>simply because the statute itself and those defending it in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>court say that it is? Every objective indication shows that&para;<br>the provision’s primary purpose is to restrict speech that&para;<br>opposes abortion.&para;<br>I begin, as suggested above, with the fact that the Act&para;<br>burdens only the public spaces outside abortion clinics.&para;<br>One might have expected the majority to defend the stat­&para;<br>ute’s peculiar targeting by arguing that those locations&para;<br>regularly face the safety and access problems that it says&para;<br>the Act was designed to solve. But the majority does not&para;<br>make that argument because it would be untrue. As the&para;<br>Court belatedly discovers in Part IV of its opinion, al­&para;<br>though the statute applies to all abortion clinics in Massa­&para;<br>chusetts, only one is known to have been beset by the&para;<br>problems that the statute supposedly addresses. See ante,&para;<br>at 26, 28. The Court uses this striking fact (a smoking&para;<br>gun, so to speak) as a basis for concluding that the law is&para;<br>insufficiently “tailored” to safety and access concerns (Part&para;<br>IV) rather than as a basis for concluding that it is not&para;<br>directed to those concerns at all, but to the suppression of&para;<br>antiabortion speech. That is rather like invoking the eight&para;<br>missed human targets of a shooter who has killed one&para;<br>victim to prove, not that he is guilty of attempted mass&para;<br>murder, but that he has bad aim.&para;<br>Whether the statute “restrict[s] more speech than&para;<br>necessary” in light of the problems that it allegedly ad­&para;<br>dresses, ante, at 14–15, is, to be sure, relevant to the&para;<br>tailoring component of the First Amendment analysis (the&para;<br>shooter doubtless did have bad aim), but it is also rele­&para;<br>vant—powerfully relevant—to whether the law is really&para;<br>directed to safety and access concerns or rather to the&para;<br>suppression of a particular type of speech. Showing that a&para;<br>law that suppresses speech on a specific subject is so far­&para;<br>reaching that it applies even when the asserted non­&para;<br>speech-related problems are not present is persuasive&para;<br>evidence that the law is content based. In its zeal to treat&para;<br>abortion-related speech as a special category, the majority&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v. COAKLEY&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>distorts not only the First Amendment but also the ordi­&para;<br>nary logic of probative inferences.&para;<br>The structure of the Act also indicates that it rests on&para;<br>content-based concerns. The goals of “public safety, pa­&para;<br>tient access to healthcare, and the unobstructed use of&para;<br>public sidewalks and roadways,” Brief for Respondents 27,&para;<br>are already achieved by an earlier-enacted subsection of&para;<br>the statute, which provides criminal penalties for “[a]ny&para;<br>person who knowingly obstructs, detains, hinders, im­&para;<br>pedes or blocks another person’s entry to or exit from a&para;<br>reproductive health care facility.” §120E½(e). As the&para;<br>majority recognizes, that provision is easy to enforce. See&para;<br>ante, at 28–29. Thus, the speech-free zones carved out by&para;<br>subsection (b) add nothing to safety and access; what they&para;<br>achieve, and what they were obviously designed to&para;<br>achieve, is the suppression of speech opposing abortion.&para;<br>Further contradicting the Court’s fanciful defense of the&para;<br>Act is the fact that subsection (b) was enacted as a more&para;<br>easily enforceable substitute for a prior provision. That pro­&para;<br>vision did not exclude people entirely from the restricted&para;<br>areas around abortion clinics; rather, it forbade people&para;<br>in those areas to approach within six feet of another per­&para;<br>son without that person’s consent “for the purpose of pass­&para;<br>ing a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engag­&para;<br>ing in oral protest, education or counseling with such&para;<br>other person.” §120E½(b) (West 2000). As the majority&para;<br>acknowledges, that provision was “modeled on a . . . Colo­&para;<br>rado law that this Court had upheld in Hill.” Ante, at 2.&para;<br>And in that case, the Court recognized that the statute in&para;<br>question was directed at the suppression of unwelcome&para;<br>speech, vindicating what Hill called “[t]he unwilling lis­&para;<br>tener’s interest in avoiding unwanted communication.”&para;<br>530 U. S., at 716. The Court held that interest to be con­&para;<br>tent neutral. Id., at 719–725.&para;<br>The provision at issue here was indisputably meant to&para;<br>serve the same interest in protecting citizens’ supposed&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>right to avoid speech that they would rather not hear. For&para;<br>that reason, we granted a second question for review in&para;<br>this case (though one would not know that from the&para;<br>Court’s opinion, which fails to mention it): whether Hill&para;<br>should be cut back or cast aside. See Pet. for Cert. i. (stat­&para;<br>ing second question presented as “If Hill . . . permits en­&para;<br>forcement of this law, whether Hill should be limited or&para;<br>overruled”); 570 U. S. ___ (2013) (granting certiorari with­&para;<br>out reservation). The majority avoids that question by&para;<br>declaring the Act content neutral on other (entirely unper­&para;<br>suasive) grounds. In concluding that the statute is con­&para;<br>tent based and therefore subject to strict scrutiny, I neces­&para;<br>sarily conclude that Hill should be overruled. Reasons for&para;<br>doing so are set forth in the dissents in that case, see 530&para;<br>U. S., at 741–765 (SCALIA, J.); id., at 765–790 (KENNEDY,&para;<br>J.), and in the abundance of scathing academic commen­&para;<br>tary describing how Hill stands in contradiction to our&para;<br>First Amendment jurisprudence.4 Protecting people from&para;<br>speech they do not want to hear is not a function that the&para;<br>First Amendment allows the government to undertake in&para;<br>the public streets and sidewalks.&para;<br>One final thought regarding Hill: It can be argued, and&para;<br>it should be argued in the next case, that by stating that&para;<br>“the Act would not be content neutral if it were concerned&para;<br>with undesirable effects that arise from . . . ‘[l]isteners’&para;<br>reactions to speech,’ ” ante, at 13 (quoting Boos v. Barry,&para;<br>485 U. S. 312, 321 (1988) (brackets in original)), and then&para;<br>holding the Act unconstitutional for being insufficiently&para;<br>tailored to safety and access concerns, the Court itself has&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 “Hill . . . is inexplicable on standard free-speech grounds[,] and . . . it&para;<br>is shameful the Supreme Court would have upheld this piece of legisla­&para;<br>tion on the reasoning that it gave.” Constitutional Law Symposium,&para;<br>Professor Michael W.

COAKLEY&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>sub silentio (and perhaps inadvertently) overruled Hill.&para;<br>The unavoidable implication of that holding is that protec­&para;<br>tion against unwelcome speech cannot justify restrictions&para;<br>on the use of public streets and sidewalks.&para;<br>B. Exemption for Abortion-Clinic Employees or Agents&para;<br>Petitioners contend that the Act targets speech opposing&para;<br>abortion (and thus constitutes a presumptively invalid&para;<br>viewpoint-discriminatory restriction) for another reason&para;<br>as well: It exempts “employees or agents” of an abortion&para;<br>clinic “acting within the scope of their employment,”&para;<br>§120E½(b)(2).&para;<br>It goes without saying that “[g]ranting waivers to fa­&para;<br>vored speakers (or . . . denying them to disfavored speak­&para;<br>ers) would of course be unconstitutional.” Thomas v.&para;<br>Chicago Park Dist., 534 U. S. 316, 325 (2002). The major­&para;<br>ity opinion sets forth a two-part inquiry for assessing&para;<br>whether a regulation is content based, but when it comes&para;<br>to assessing the exemption for abortion-clinic employees or&para;<br>agents, the Court forgets its own teaching. Its opinion&para;<br>jumps right over the prong that asks whether the provi­&para;<br>sion “draw[s] . . . distinctions on its face,” ante, at 12, and&para;<br>instead proceeds directly to the purpose-related prong, see&para;<br>ibid., asking whether the exemption “represent[s] a gov­&para;<br>ernmental attempt to give one side of a debatable public&para;<br>question an advantage in expressing its views to the peo­&para;<br>ple,” ante, at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted). I&para;<br>disagree with the majority’s negative answer to that ques­&para;<br>tion, but that is beside the point if the text of the statute—&para;<br>whatever its purposes might have been—“license[s] one&para;<br>side of a debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the other&para;<br>to follow Marquis of Queensberry rules.” R. A. V. v. St.&para;<br>Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 392 (1992).&para;<br>Is there any serious doubt that abortion-clinic employees&para;<br>or agents “acting within the scope of their employment”&para;<br>near clinic entrances may—indeed, often will—speak in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>favor of abortion (“You are doing the right thing”)? Or&para;<br>speak in opposition to the message of abortion oppo­&para;<br>nents—saying, for example, that “this is a safe facility” to&para;<br>rebut the statement that it is not? See Tr. of Oral Arg.&para;<br>37–38. The Court’s contrary assumption is simply incred­&para;<br>ible. And the majority makes no attempt to establish the&para;<br>further necessary proposition that abortion-clinic employ­&para;<br>ees and agents do not engage in nonspeech activities&para;<br>directed to the suppression of antiabortion speech by&para;<br>hampering the efforts of counselors to speak to prospective&para;<br>clients. Are we to believe that a clinic employee sent out&para;<br>to “escort” prospective clients into the building would not&para;<br>seek to prevent a counselor like Eleanor McCullen from&para;<br>communicating with them? He could pull a woman away&para;<br>from an approaching counselor, cover her ears, or make&para;<br>loud noises to drown out the counselor’s pleas.&para;<br>The Court points out that the exemption may allow into&para;<br>the speech-free zones clinic employees other than escorts,&para;<br>such as “the maintenance worker shoveling a snowy side­&para;<br>walk or the security guard patrolling a clinic entrance.”&para;<br>Ante, at 16. I doubt that Massachusetts legislators had&para;<br>those people in mind, but whether they did is in any event&para;<br>irrelevant. Whatever other activity is permitted, so long&para;<br>as the statute permits speech favorable to abortion rights&para;<br>while excluding antiabortion speech, it discriminates on&para;<br>the basis of viewpoint.&para;<br>The Court takes the peculiar view that, so long as the&para;<br>clinics have not specifically authorized their employees to&para;<br>speak in favor of abortion (or, presumably, to impede&para;<br>antiabortion speech), there is no viewpoint discrimination.&para;<br>See ibid. But it is axiomatic that “where words are em­&para;<br>ployed in a statute which had at the time a well-known&para;<br>meaning at common law or in the law of this country[,]&para;<br>they are presumed to have been used in that sense unless&para;<br>the context compels to the contrary.” Standard Oil Co. of&para;<br>N.

COAKLEY&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>“scope of employment” is a well-known common-law con­&para;<br>cept that includes “[t]he range of reasonable and foresee­&para;<br>able activities that an employee engages in while carrying&para;<br>out the employer’s business.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1465&para;<br>(9th ed. 2009). The employer need not specifically direct&para;<br>or sanction each aspect of an employee’s conduct for it to&para;<br>qualify. See Restatement (Second) of Agency §229 (1957);&para;<br>see also Restatement (Third) of Agency §7.07(2), and&para;<br>Comment b (2005). Indeed, employee conduct can qualify&para;<br>even if the employer specifically forbids it. See Restate­&para;<br>ment (Second) §230. In any case, it is implausible that&para;<br>clinics would bar escorts from engaging in the sort of&para;<br>activity mentioned above. Moreover, a statute that forbids&para;<br>one side but not the other to convey its message does not&para;<br>become viewpoint neutral simply because the favored side&para;<br>chooses voluntarily to abstain from activity that the stat­&para;<br>ute permits.&para;<br>There is not a shadow of a doubt that the assigned or&para;<br>foreseeable conduct of a clinic employee or agent can&para;<br>include both speaking in favor of abortion rights and&para;<br>countering the speech of people like petitioners. See post,&para;<br>at 1–2 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). Indeed, as the&para;<br>majority acknowledges, the trial record includes testimony&para;<br>that escorts at the Boston clinic “expressed views about&para;<br>abortion to the women they were accompanying, thwarted&para;<br>petitioners’ attempts to speak and hand literature to the&para;<br>women, and disparaged petitioners in various ways,”&para;<br>including by calling them “ ‘crazy.’ ”&para;<br>Ante, at 7, 16&para;<br>(citing App. 165, 168–169, 177–178, 189–190). What a&para;<br>surprise! The Web site for the Planned Parenthood&para;<br>League of Massachusetts (which operates the three&para;<br>abortion facilities where petitioners attempt to counsel&para;<br>women), urges readers to “Become a Clinic Escort Vol­&para;<br>unteer” in order to “provide a safe space for patients&para;<br>by escorting them through protestors to the health center.”&para;<br>Volunteer and Internship Opportunities, online at https://&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

The dangers that the Web site attributes to&para;<br>“protestors” are related entirely to speech, not to safety or&para;<br>access. “Protestors,” it reports, “hold signs, try to speak to&para;<br>patients entering the building, and distribute literature&para;<br>that can be misleading.” Ibid. The “safe space” provided&para;<br>by escorts is protection from that speech.&para;<br>Going from bad to worse, the majority’s opinion con­&para;<br>tends that “the record before us contains insufficient&para;<br>evidence to show” that abortion-facility escorts have actu­&para;<br>ally spoken in favor of abortion (or, presumably, hindered&para;<br>antiabortion speech) while acting within the scope of their&para;<br>employment. Ante, at 18. Here is a brave new First&para;<br>Amendment test: Speech restrictions favoring one view­&para;<br>point over another are not content based unless it can be&para;<br>shown that the favored viewpoint has actually been ex­&para;<br>pressed. A city ordinance closing a park adjoining the&para;<br>Republican National Convention to all speakers except&para;<br>those whose remarks have been approved by the Repub­&para;<br>lican National Committee is thus not subject to strict&para;<br>scrutiny unless it can be shown that someone has given&para;<br>committee-endorsed remarks. For this Court to suggest&para;<br>such a test is astonishing.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The Court states that I can make this assertion “only by quoting a&para;<br>sentence that is explicitly limited to as-applied challenges and treating&para;<br>it as relevant to facial challenges.” Ante, at 18, n. 4. That is not so.&para;<br>The sentence in question appears in a paragraph immediately following&para;<br>rejection of the facial challenge, which begins: “It would be a very&para;<br>different question if it turned out that a clinic authorized escorts to&para;<br>speak about abortion inside the buffer zones.” Ante, at 17. And the&para;<br>prior discussion regarding the facial challenge points to the fact that&para;<br>“[t]here is no suggestion in the record that any of the clinics authorize&para;<br>their employees to speak about abortion in the buffer zones.” Ante, at&para;<br>16. To be sure, the paragraph in question then goes on to concede only&para;<br>that the statute’s constitutionality as applied would depend upon&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v. COAKLEY&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>C. Conclusion&para;<br>In sum, the Act should be reviewed under the strict­&para;<br>scrutiny standard applicable to content-based legislation.&para;<br>That standard requires that a regulation represent “the&para;<br>least restrictive means” of furthering “a compelling Gov­&para;<br>ernment interest.” United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 813 (2000) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). Respondents do not even at­&para;<br>tempt to argue that subsection (b) survives this test. See&para;<br>ante, at 10. “Suffice it to say that if protecting people from&para;<br>unwelcome communications”—the actual purpose of the&para;<br>provision—“is a compelling state interest, the First&para;<br>Amendment is a dead letter.” Hill, 530 U. S., at 748–749&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., dissenting).&para;<br>III. Narrow Tailoring&para;<br>Having determined that the Act is content based and&para;<br>does not withstand strict scrutiny, I need not pursue the&para;<br>inquiry conducted in Part IV of the Court’s opinion—&para;<br>whether the statute is “ ‘narrowly tailored to serve a signif­&para;<br>icant governmental interest,’ ” ante, at 18 (quoting Ward,&para;<br>491 U. S., at 796 (internal quotation marks omitted)). I&para;<br>suppose I could do so, taking as a given the Court’s erro­&para;<br>neous content-neutrality conclusion in Part III; and if I&para;<br>did, I suspect I would agree with the majority that the&para;<br>legislation is not narrowly tailored to advance the inter­&para;<br>ests asserted by respondents. But I prefer not to take part&para;<br>in the assembling of an apparent but specious unanimity.&para;<br>I leave both the plainly unnecessary and erroneous half&para;<br>——————&para;<br>explicit clinic authorization. Even that seems to me wrong. Saying&para;<br>that voluntary action by a third party can cause an otherwise valid&para;<br>statute to violate the First Amendment as applied seems to me little&para;<br>better than saying it can cause such a statute to violate the First&para;<br>Amendment facially. A statute that punishes me for speaking unless x&para;<br>chooses to speak is unconstitutional facially and as applied, without&para;<br>reference to x’s action.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §120E½(b) (West 2012),&para;<br>violates the First Amendment. As the Court recognizes, if&para;<br>the Massachusetts law discriminates on the basis of view­&para;<br>point, it is unconstitutional, see ante, at 10, and I believe&para;<br>the law clearly discriminates on this ground.&para;<br>The Massachusetts statute generally prohibits any&para;<br>person from entering a buffer zone around an abortion&para;<br>clinic during the clinic’s business hours, §120E½(c), but&para;<br>the law contains an exemption for “employees or agents of&para;<br>such facility acting within the scope of their employment.”&para;<br>§120E½(b)(2). Thus, during business hours, individuals&para;<br>who wish to counsel against abortion or to criticize the&para;<br>particular clinic may not do so within the buffer zone. If&para;<br>they engage in such conduct, they commit a crime. See&para;<br>§120E½(d). By contrast, employees and agents of the&para;<br>clinic may enter the zone and engage in any conduct that&para;<br>falls within the scope of their employment. A clinic may&para;<br>direct or authorize an employee or agent, while within the&para;<br>zone, to express favorable views about abortion or the&para;<br>clinic, and if the employee exercises that authority, the&para;<br>employee’s conduct is perfectly lawful. In short, petition­&para;<br>ers and other critics of a clinic are silenced, while the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>McCULLEN v. COAKLEY&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>clinic may authorize its employees to express speech in&para;<br>support of the clinic and its work.&para;<br>Consider this entirely realistic situation. A woman&para;<br>enters a buffer zone and heads haltingly toward the en­&para;<br>trance. A sidewalk counselor, such as petitioners, enters&para;<br>the buffer zone, approaches the woman and says, “If you&para;<br>have doubts about an abortion, let me try to answer any&para;<br>questions you may have. The clinic will not give you good&para;<br>information.” At the same time, a clinic employee, as&para;<br>instructed by the management, approaches the same&para;<br>woman and says, “Come inside and we will give you hon­&para;<br>est answers to all your questions.” The sidewalk counselor&para;<br>and the clinic employee expressed opposing viewpoints,&para;<br>but only the first violated the statute.&para;<br>Or suppose that the issue is not abortion but the safety&para;<br>of a particular facility. Suppose that there was a recent&para;<br>report of a botched abortion at the clinic. A nonemployee&para;<br>may not enter the buffer zone to warn about the clinic’s&para;<br>health record, but an employee may enter and tell pro­&para;<br>spective clients that the clinic is safe.&para;<br>It is clear on the face of the Massachusetts law that it&para;<br>discriminates based on viewpoint. Speech in favor of the&para;<br>clinic and its work by employees and agents is permitted;&para;<br>speech criticizing the clinic and its work is a crime. This&para;<br>is blatant viewpoint discrimination.&para;<br>The Court holds not only that the Massachusetts law is&para;<br>viewpoint neutral but also that it does not discriminate&para;<br>based on content. See ante, at 11–15. The Court treats&para;<br>the Massachusetts law like one that bans all speech&para;<br>within the buffer zone. While such a law would be content&para;<br>neutral on its face, there are circumstances in which a law&para;<br>forbidding all speech at a particular location would not be&para;<br>content neutral in fact. Suppose, for example, that a&para;<br>facially content-neutral law is enacted for the purpose of&para;<br>suppressing speech on a particular topic. Such a law&para;<br>would not be content neutral. See, e.g., Turner Broadcast-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>ing System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 645–646 (1994).&para;<br>In this case, I do not think that it is possible to reach a&para;<br>judgment about the intent of the Massachusetts Legisla­&para;<br>ture without taking into account the fact that the law that&para;<br>the legislature enacted blatantly discriminates based on&para;<br>viewpoint. In light of this feature, as well as the over­&para;<br>breadth that the Court identifies, see ante, at 23–27, it&para;<br>cannot be said, based on the present record, that the law&para;<br>would be content neutral even if the exemption for clinic&para;<br>employees and agents were excised. However, if the law&para;<br>were truly content neutral, I would agree with the Court&para;<br>that the law would still be unconstitutional on the ground&para;<br>that it burdens more speech than is necessary to serve the&para;<br>Commonwealth’s asserted interests.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
