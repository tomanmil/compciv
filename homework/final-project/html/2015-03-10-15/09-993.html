Because of accu&para;<br>mulating evidence that long-term metoclopramide use can cause&para;<br>tardive dyskinesia, a severe neurological disorder, warning labels for&para;<br>the drug have been strengthened and clarified several times, most re&para;<br>cently in 2009.&para;<br>Respondents were prescribed Reglan in 2001 and 2002, but both&para;<br>received the generic drug from their pharmacists. After taking the&para;<br>drug as prescribed for several years, both developed tardive dyskine&para;<br>sia. In separate state-court tort actions, they sued petitioners, the&para;<br>generic drug manufacturers that produced the metoclopramide they&para;<br>took (Manufacturers). Each respondent alleged, inter alia, that long&para;<br>term metoclopramide use caused her disorder and that the Manufac&para;<br>turers were liable under state tort law for failing to provide adequate&para;<br>warning labels. In both suits, the Manufacturers urged that federal&para;<br>statutes and FDA regulations pre-empted the state tort claims by re&para;<br>quiring the same safety and efficacy labeling for generic metoclopra&para;<br>mide as was mandated at the time for Reglan. The Fifth and Eighth&para;<br>Circuits rejected these arguments, holding that respondents’ claims&para;<br>were not pre-empted.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is reversed, and the cases are remanded.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 09–1039, Actavis Elizabeth, LLC v.

MENSING&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>588 F. 3d 603 and 593 F. 3d 428, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to&para;<br>all but Part III–B–2, concluding that federal drug regulations appli&para;<br>cable to generic drug manufacturers directly conflict with, and thus&para;<br>pre-empt, these state claims. Pp. 4–14, 17–20.&para;<br>(a) Because pre-emption analysis requires a comparison between&para;<br>federal and state law, the Court begins by identifying the state tort&para;<br>duties and federal labeling requirements applicable to the Manufac&para;<br>turers. Pp. 4–10.&para;<br>(1) State tort law requires a manufacturer that is, or should be,&para;<br>aware of its drug’s danger to label it in a way that renders it rea&para;<br>sonably safe. Respondents pleaded that the Manufacturers knew, or&para;<br>should have known, both that the long-term use of their products car&para;<br>ried a high risk of tardive dyskinesia and that their labels did not&para;<br>adequately warn of that risk. Taking these allegations as true, the&para;<br>state-law duty required the Manufacturers to use a different,&para;<br>stronger label than the one they actually used. Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(2) On the other hand, federal drug regulations, as interpreted by&para;<br>the FDA, prevented the Manufacturers from independently changing&para;<br>their generic drugs’ safety labels. A manufacturer seeking federal&para;<br>approval to market a new drug must prove that it is safe and effec&para;<br>tive and that the proposed label is accurate and adequate. Although&para;<br>the same rules originally applied to all drugs, the 1984 law commonly&para;<br>called the Hatch-Waxman Amendments allows a generic drug manu&para;<br>facturer to gain FDA approval simply by showing that its drug is&para;<br>equivalent to an already-approved brand-name drug, and that the&para;<br>safety and efficacy labeling proposed for its drug is the same as that&para;<br>approved for the brand-name drug. Respondents contend that fed&para;<br>eral law nevertheless provides avenues through which the Manufac&para;<br>turers could have altered their metoclopramide labels in time to pre&para;<br>vent the injuries here. These include: (1) the FDA’s “changes-being&para;<br>effected” (CBE) process, which permits drug manufacturers, without&para;<br>preapproval, to add or strengthen a warning label; and (2) sending&para;<br>“Dear Doctor” letters providing additional warnings to prescribing&para;<br>physicians and other healthcare professionals. However, the FDA&para;<br>denies that the Manufacturers could have used either of these proc&para;<br>esses to unilaterally strengthen their warning labels. The Court de&para;<br>fers to the FDA’s views because they are not plainly erroneous or in&para;<br>consistent with the regulations, and there is no other reason to doubt&para;<br>that they reflect the FDA’s fair and considered judgment. Auer v.&para;<br>Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461, 462. Assuming, without deciding, that&para;<br>the FDA is correct that federal law nevertheless required the Manu&para;<br>facturers to ask for the agency’s assistance in convincing the brand&para;<br>name manufacturer to adopt a stronger label, the Court turns to the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>pre-emption question. Pp. 5–10.&para;<br>(b) Where state and federal law directly conflict, state law must&para;<br>give way. See, e.g., Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 583. Such a con&para;<br>flict exists where it is “impossible for a private party to comply with&para;<br>both state and federal requirements.” Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick,&para;<br>514 U. S. 280, 287. Pp. 11–14, 17–20.&para;<br>(1) The Court finds impossibility here. If the Manufacturers had&para;<br>independently changed their labels to satisfy their state-law duty to&para;<br>attach a safer label to their generic metoclopramide, they would have&para;<br>violated the federal requirement that generic drug labels be the same&para;<br>as the corresponding brand-name drug labels. Thus, it was impossi&para;<br>ble for them to comply with both state and federal law. And even if&para;<br>they had fulfilled their federal duty to ask for FDA help in strength&para;<br>ening the corresponding brand-name label, assuming such a duty ex&para;<br>ists, they would not have satisfied their state tort-law duty. State&para;<br>law demanded a safer label; it did not require communication with&para;<br>the FDA about the possibility of a safer label. Pp. 11–12.&para;<br>(2) The Court rejects the argument that the Manufacturers’ pre&para;<br>emption defense fails because they failed to ask the FDA for help in&para;<br>changing the corresponding brand-name label. The proper question&para;<br>for “impossibility” analysis is whether the private party could inde&para;<br>pendently do under federal law what state law requires of it. See&para;<br>Wyeth, supra, at 573. Accepting respondents’ argument would render&para;<br>conflict pre-emption largely meaningless by making most conflicts be&para;<br>tween state and federal law illusory. In these cases, it is possible&para;<br>that, had the Manufacturers asked the FDA for help, they might&para;<br>have eventually been able to strengthen their warning label. But it&para;<br>is also possible that they could have convinced the FDA to reinterpret&para;<br>its regulations in a manner that would have opened the CBE process&para;<br>to them, persuaded the FDA to rewrite its generic drug regulations&para;<br>entirely, or talked Congress into amending the Hatch-Waxman&para;<br>Amendments. If these conjectures sufficed to prevent federal and&para;<br>state law from conflicting, it is unclear when, outside of express pre&para;<br>emption, the Supremacy Clause would have any force. That Clause—&para;<br>which makes federal law “the supreme Law of the Land . . . any&para;<br>Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary not&para;<br>withstanding,” U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2—cannot be read to permit&para;<br>an approach to pre-emption that renders conflict pre-emption all but&para;<br>meaningless. Here, it is enough to hold that when a party cannot&para;<br>satisfy its state duties without the Federal Government’s special&para;<br>permission and assistance, which is dependent on the exercise of&para;<br>judgment by a federal agency, that party cannot independently sat&para;<br>isfy those state duties for pre-emption purposes. Pp. 12–14, 17.&para;<br>(3) Wyeth is not to the contrary. The Court there held that a&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>state tort action against a brand-name drug manufacturer for failure&para;<br>to provide an adequate warning label was not pre-empted because it&para;<br>was possible for the manufacturer to comply with both state and fed&para;<br>eral law under the FDA’s CBE regulation. 555 U. S., at 572–573.&para;<br>The federal statutes and regulations that apply to brand-name drug&para;<br>manufacturers differ, by Congress’ design, from those applicable to&para;<br>generic drug manufacturers. And different federal statutes and regu&para;<br>lations may, as here, lead to different pre-emption results. This&para;<br>Court will not distort the Supremacy Clause in order to create simi&para;<br>lar pre-emption across a dissimilar statutory scheme. Congress and&para;<br>the FDA retain authority to change the law and regulations if they so&para;<br>desire.

MENSING &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>Metoclopramide is a drug designed to speed the move­&para;<br>ment of food through the digestive system. The Food and&para;<br>Drug Administration (FDA) first approved metoclopra­&para;<br>mide tablets, under the brand name Reglan, in 1980. Five&para;<br>years later, generic manufacturers also began producing meto­&para;<br>clopramide. The drug is commonly used to treat digestive tract problems such as diabetic gastroparesis and&para;<br>gastroesophageal reflux disorder.&para;<br>Evidence has accumulated that long-term metoclopra­&para;<br>mide use can cause tardive dyskinesia, a severe neurologi­&para;<br>cal disorder. Studies have shown that up to 29% of pa­&para;<br>tients who take metoclopramide for several years develop&para;<br>this condition. McNeil v. Wyeth, 462 F. 3d 364, 370,&para;<br>n. 5 (CA5 2006); see also Shaffer, Butterfield, Pamer, &amp;&para;<br>Mackey, Tardive Dyskinesia Risks and Metoclopramide&para;<br>Use Before and After U. S. Market Withdrawal of Cis­&para;<br>apride, 44 J. Am. Pharmacists Assn. 661, 663 (2004) (not­&para;<br>ing 87 cases of metoclopramide-related tardive dyskinesia&para;<br>reported to the FDA’s adverse event reporting system by&para;<br>mid-2003).&para;<br>Accordingly, warning labels for the drug have been&para;<br>strengthened and clarified several times. In 1985, the&para;<br>label was modified to warn that “tardive dyskinesia . . .&para;<br>may develop in patients treated with metoclopramide,”&para;<br>and the drug’s package insert added that “[t]herapy longer&para;<br>than 12 weeks has not been evaluated and cannot be&para;<br>recommended.” Physician’s Desk Reference 1635–1636&para;<br>(41st ed. 1987); see also Brief for Petitioner PLIVA et al.&para;<br>21–22 (hereinafter PLIVA Brief). In 2004, the brand­&para;<br>name Reglan manufacturer requested, and the FDA ap­&para;<br>proved, a label change to add that “[t]herapy should not&para;<br>exceed 12 weeks in duration.” Brief for United States as&para;<br>Amicus Curiae 8 (hereinafter U. S. Brief). And in 2009,&para;<br>the FDA ordered a black box warning—its strongest—&para;<br>which states: “Treatment with metoclopramide can cause&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tardive dyskinesia, a serious movement disorder that is&para;<br>often irreversible. . . . Treatment with metoclopramide&para;<br>for longer than 12 weeks should be avoided in all but rare&para;<br>cases.” See Physician’s Desk Reference 2902 (65th ed.&para;<br>2011).&para;<br>Gladys Mensing and Julie Demahy, the plaintiffs in&para;<br>these consolidated cases, were prescribed Reglan in 2001&para;<br>and 2002, respectively. Both received generic metoclo­&para;<br>pramide from their pharmacists. After taking the drug&para;<br>as prescribed for several years, both women developed&para;<br>tardive dyskinesia.&para;<br>In separate suits, Mensing and Demahy sued the ge­&para;<br>neric drug manufacturers that produced the metoclopra­&para;<br>mide they took (Manufacturers). Each alleged, as relevant&para;<br>here, that long-term metoclopramide use caused her tar­&para;<br>dive dyskinesia and that the Manufacturers were liable&para;<br>under state tort law (specifically, that of Minnesota and&para;<br>Louisiana) for failing to provide adequate warning labels.&para;<br>They claimed that “despite mounting evidence that long&para;<br>term metoclopramide use carries a risk of tardive dyskine­&para;<br>sia far greater than that indicated on the label,” none of&para;<br>the Manufacturers had changed their labels to adequately&para;<br>warn of that danger. Mensing v. Wyeth, Inc., 588 F. 3d&para;<br>603, 605 (CA8 2009); see also Demahy v. Actavis, Inc., 593&para;<br>F. 3d 428, 430 (CA5 2010).&para;<br>In both suits, the Manufacturers urged that federal law&para;<br>pre-empted the state tort claims. According to the Manu­&para;<br>facturers, federal statutes and FDA regulations required&para;<br>them to use the same safety and efficacy labeling as their&para;<br>brand-name counterparts. This means, they argued, that&para;<br>it was impossible to simultaneously comply with both&para;<br>federal law and any state tort-law duty that required them&para;<br>to use a different label.&para;<br>The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Eighth Circuits&para;<br>rejected the Manufacturers’ arguments and held that Men­&para;<br>sing and Demahy’s claims were not pre-empted. See&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>588 F. 3d, at 614; 593 F. 3d, at 449. We granted certiorari,&para;<br>562 U. S. ___ (2010), consolidated the cases, and now&para;<br>reverse each.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Pre-emption analysis requires us to compare federal and&para;<br>state law. We therefore begin by identifying the state tort&para;<br>duties and federal labeling requirements applicable to the&para;<br>Manufacturers.&para;<br>A&para;<br>It is undisputed that Minnesota and Louisiana tort law&para;<br>require a drug manufacturer that is or should be aware of&para;<br>its product’s danger to label that product in a way that&para;<br>renders it reasonably safe. Under Minnesota law, which&para;<br>applies to Mensing’s lawsuit, “where the manufacturer . . .&para;<br>of a product has actual or constructive knowledge of&para;<br>danger to users, the . . . manufacturer has a duty to give&para;<br>warning of such dangers.” Frey v. Montgomery Ward &amp;&para;<br>Co., 258 N. W. 2d 782, 788 (Minn. 1977). Similarly, under&para;<br>Louisiana law applicable to Demahy’s lawsuit, “a manu­&para;<br>facturer’s duty to warn includes a duty to provide ade­&para;<br>quate instructions for safe use of a product.” Stahl v.&para;<br>Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., 283 F. 3d 254, 269–270&para;<br>(CA5 2002); see also La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §9:2800.57 (West&para;<br>2009). In both States, a duty to warn falls specifically on&para;<br>the manufacturer. See Marks v. OHMEDA, Inc., 2003–&para;<br>1446, pp. 8–9 (La. App. 3/31/04), 871 So. 2d 1148, 1155;&para;<br>Gray v. Badger Min. Corp., 676 N. W. 2d 268, 274 (Minn.&para;<br>2004).&para;<br>Mensing and Demahy have pleaded that the Manufac­&para;<br>turers knew or should have known of the high risk of&para;<br>tardive dyskinesia inherent in the long-term use of their&para;<br>product. They have also pleaded that the Manufacturers&para;<br>knew or should have known that their labels did not ade­&para;<br>quately warn of that risk. App. 437–438, 67–69, 94–96.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The parties do not dispute that, if these allegations are&para;<br>true, state law required the Manufacturers to use a differ­&para;<br>ent, safer label.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Federal law imposes far more complex drug labeling&para;<br>requirements. We begin with what is not in dispute.&para;<br>Under the 1962 Drug Amendments to the Federal Food,&para;<br>Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 76 Stat. 780, 21 U. S. C. §301 et&para;<br>seq., a manufacturer seeking federal approval to market a&para;<br>new drug must prove that it is safe and effective and that&para;<br>the proposed label is accurate and adequate.1 See, e.g.,&para;<br>21 U. S. C. §§355(b)(1), (d); Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555,&para;<br>567 (2009). Meeting those requirements involves costly&para;<br>and lengthy clinical testing. §§355(b)(1)(A), (d); see also D.&para;<br>Beers, Generic and Innovator Drugs: A Guide to FDA&para;<br>Approval Requirements §2.02[A] (7th ed. 2008).&para;<br>Originally, the same rules applied to all drugs. In 1984,&para;<br>however, Congress passed the Drug Price Competition and&para;<br>Patent Term Restoration Act, 98 Stat. 1585, commonly&para;<br>called the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Under this law,&para;<br>“generic drugs” can gain FDA approval simply by showing&para;<br>equivalence to a reference listed drug that has already&para;<br>been approved by the FDA.2 21 U. S. C. §355(j)(2)(A).&para;<br>This allows manufacturers to develop generic drugs in­&para;<br>expensively, without duplicating the clinical trials already&para;<br>performed on the equivalent brand-name drug. A generic&para;<br>drug application must also “show that the [safety and&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 All relevant events in these cases predate the Food and Drug&para;<br>Administration Amendments Act of 2007, 121 Stat. 823. We therefore&para;<br>refer exclusively to the pre-2007 statutes and regulations and express&para;<br>no view on the impact of the 2007 Act.&para;<br>2 As we use it here, “generic drug” refers to a drug designed to be a&para;<br>copy of a reference listed drug (typically a brand-name drug), and thus&para;<br>identical in active ingredients, safety, and efficacy. See, e.g., United&para;<br>States v. Generix Drug Corp., 460 U. S. 453, 454–455 (1983); 21 CFR&para;<br>§314.3(b) (2006) (defining “reference listed drug”).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>efficacy] labeling proposed . . . is the same as the labeling&para;<br>approved for the [brand-name] drug.” §355(j)(2)(A)(v); see&para;<br>also §355(j)(4)(G); Beers §§3.01, 3.03[A].&para;<br>As a result, brand-name and generic drug manufactur­&para;<br>ers have different federal drug labeling duties. A brand­&para;<br>name manufacturer seeking new drug approval is respon­&para;<br>sible for the accuracy and adequacy of its label. See, e.g.,&para;<br>21 U. S. C. §§355(b)(1), (d); Wyeth, supra, at 570–571. A&para;<br>manufacturer seeking generic drug approval, on the other&para;<br>hand, is responsible for ensuring that its warning label is&para;<br>the same as the brand name’s. See, e.g., §355(j)(2)(A)(v);&para;<br>§355(j)(4)(G); 21 CFR §§314.94(a)(8), 314.127(a)(7).&para;<br>The parties do not disagree. What is in dispute is&para;<br>whether, and to what extent, generic manufacturers may&para;<br>change their labels after initial FDA approval. Mensing&para;<br>and Demahy contend that federal law provided several&para;<br>avenues through which the Manufacturers could have&para;<br>altered their metoclopramide labels in time to prevent the&para;<br>injuries here. The FDA, however, tells us that it inter­&para;<br>prets its regulations to require that the warning labels of a&para;<br>brand-name drug and its generic copy must always be the&para;<br>same—thus, generic drug manufacturers have an ongoing&para;<br>federal duty of “sameness.” U. S. Brief 16; see also 57 Fed.&para;<br>Reg. 17961 (1992) (“[T]he [generic drug’s] labeling must&para;<br>be the same as the listed drug product’s labeling because&para;<br>the listed drug product is the basis for [generic drug] ap­&para;<br>proval”). The FDA’s views are “controlling unless plainly&para;<br>erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s]” or there&para;<br>is any other reason to doubt that they reflect the FDA’s&para;<br>fair and considered judgment.

See Brief&para;<br>for Respondents 33–35; see also 593 F. 3d, at 439–444;&para;<br>Gaeta v. Perrigo Pharmaceuticals Co., 630 F. 3d 1225,&para;<br>1231 (CA9 2011); Foster v. American Home Prods. Corp.,&para;<br>29 F. 3d 165, 170 (CA4 1994). The CBE process permits&para;<br>drug manufacturers to “add or strengthen a contraindica­&para;<br>tion, warning, [or] precaution,” 21 CFR §314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A)&para;<br>(2006), or to “add or strengthen an instruction about dos­&para;<br>age and administration that is intended to increase the&para;<br>safe use of the drug product,” §314.70(c)(6)(iii)(C). When&para;<br>making labeling changes using the CBE process, drug man­&para;<br>ufacturers need not wait for preapproval by the FDA,&para;<br>which ordinarily is necessary to change a label. Wyeth,&para;<br>supra, at 568.

U. S. Brief 20; 57 Fed. Reg. 17961.

S. Brief 12. By regulation, the&para;<br>FDA has interpreted that statute to require that “labeling&para;<br>shall be revised to include a warning as soon as there is&para;<br>reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard&para;<br>with a drug.” 21 CFR §201.57(e).&para;<br>According to the FDA, these requirements apply to ge­&para;<br>neric drugs.

But, we assume,&para;<br>federal law also required the Manufacturers to ask for&para;<br>FDA assistance in convincing the brand-name manufac­&para;<br>turer to adopt a stronger label, so that all corresponding&para;<br>generic drug manufacturers could do so as well.

Although an express state­&para;<br>ment on pre-emption is always preferable, the lack of such a statement&para;<br>does not end our inquiry.

Taking Mensing and Demahy’s&para;<br>allegations as true, state law imposed on the Manufac­&para;<br>turers a duty to attach a safer label to their generic meto­&para;<br>clopramide. Federal law, however, demanded that ge­&para;<br>neric drug labels be the same at all times as the corres­&para;<br>ponding brand-name drug labels. See, e.g., 21 CFR&para;<br>§314.150(b)(10). Thus, it was impossible for the Manufac­&para;<br>turers to comply with both their state-law duty to change&para;<br>the label and their federal law duty to keep the label the&para;<br>same.&para;<br>The federal duty to ask the FDA for help in strengthen­&para;<br>ing the corresponding brand-name label, assuming such&para;<br>a duty exists, does not change this analysis. Although&para;<br>requesting FDA assistance would have satisfied the Man­&para;<br>ufacturers’ federal duty, it would not have satisfied&para;<br>their state tort-law duty to provide adequate labeling.&para;<br>State law demanded a safer label; it did not instruct the&para;<br>Manufacturers to communicate with the FDA about the&para;<br>possibility of a safer label. Indeed, Mensing and Demahy&para;<br>deny that their state tort claims are based on the Manu­&para;<br>facturers’ alleged failure to ask the FDA for assistance in&para;<br>changing the labels. Brief for Respondents 53–54; cf.&para;<br>Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341&para;<br>(2001) (holding that federal drug and medical device laws&para;<br>pre-empted a state tort-law claim based on failure to&para;<br>properly communicate with the FDA).&para;<br>B&para;<br>1&para;<br>Mensing and Demahy contend that, while their state­&para;<br>law claims do not turn on whether the Manufacturers&para;<br>asked the FDA for assistance in changing their labels, the&para;<br>Manufacturers’ federal affirmative defense of pre-emption&para;<br>does. Mensing and Demahy argue that if the Manufactur­&para;<br>ers had asked the FDA for help in changing the corre­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

That is true enough. The Manufacturers “freely&para;<br>concede” that they could have asked the FDA for help.&para;<br>PLIVA Brief 48. If they had done so, and if the FDA&para;<br>decided there was sufficient supporting information, and&para;<br>if the FDA undertook negotiations with the brand-name&para;<br>manufacturer, and if adequate label changes were decided&para;<br>on and implemented, then the Manufacturers would have&para;<br>started a Mouse Trap game that eventually led to a better&para;<br>label on generic metoclopramide.&para;<br>This raises the novel question whether conflict pre­&para;<br>emption should take into account these possible actions by&para;<br>the FDA and the brand-name manufacturer. Here, what&para;<br>federal law permitted the Manufacturers to do could have&para;<br>changed, even absent a change in the law itself, depending&para;<br>on the actions of the FDA and the brand-name manufac­&para;<br>turer. Federal law does not dictate the text of each ge­&para;<br>neric drug’s label, but rather ties those labels to their&para;<br>brand-name counterparts. Thus, federal law would permit&para;<br>the Manufacturers to comply with the state labeling re­&para;<br>quirements if, and only if, the FDA and the brand-name&para;<br>manufacturer changed the brand-name label to do so.&para;<br>Mensing and Demahy assert that when a private party’s&para;<br>ability to comply with state law depends on approval and&para;<br>assistance from the FDA, proving pre-emption requires&para;<br>that party to demonstrate that the FDA would not have&para;<br>allowed compliance with state law. Here, they argue, the&para;<br>Manufacturers cannot bear their burden of proving impos­&para;<br>sibility because they did not even try to start the process&para;<br>that might ultimately have allowed them to use a safer&para;<br>label. Brief for Respondents 47. This is a fair argument,&para;<br>but we reject it.&para;<br>The question for “impossibility” is whether the private&para;<br>party could independently do under federal law what state&para;<br>law requires of it. See Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 573 (finding&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>no pre-emption where the defendant could “unilaterally”&para;<br>do what state law required). Accepting Mensing and&para;<br>Demahy’s argument would render conflict pre-emption&para;<br>largely meaningless because it would make most conflicts&para;<br>between state and federal law illusory. We can often&para;<br>imagine that a third party or the Federal Government&para;<br>might do something that makes it lawful for a private&para;<br>party to accomplish under federal law what state law&para;<br>requires of it. In these cases, it is certainly possible that,&para;<br>had the Manufacturers asked the FDA for help, they&para;<br>might have eventually been able to strengthen their warn­&para;<br>ing label. Of course, it is also possible that the Manufac­&para;<br>turers could have convinced the FDA to reinterpret its&para;<br>regulations in a manner that would have opened the CBE&para;<br>process to them. Following Mensing and Demahy’s argu­&para;<br>ment to its logical conclusion, it is also possible that,&para;<br>by asking, the Manufacturers could have persuaded the&para;<br>FDA to rewrite its generic drug regulations entirely or&para;<br>talked Congress into amending the Hatch-Waxman&para;<br>Amendments.&para;<br>If these conjectures suffice to prevent federal and state&para;<br>law from conflicting for Supremacy Clause purposes, it&para;<br>is unclear when, outside of express pre-emption, the Su­&para;<br>premacy Clause would have any force.6 We do not read&para;<br>the Supremacy Clause to permit an approach to pre­&para;<br>emption that renders conflict pre-emption all but mean­&para;<br>ingless. The Supremacy Clause, on its face, makes federal&para;<br>law “the supreme Law of the Land” even absent an ex­&para;<br>press statement by Congress. U. S. Const., Art.

The non obstante provision in the&para;<br>Supremacy Clause therefore suggests that federal law&para;<br>should be understood to impliedly repeal conflicting state&para;<br>law.&para;<br>Further, the provision suggests that courts should not&para;<br>strain to find ways to reconcile federal law with seemingly&para;<br>conflicting state law.

Wyeth, 555 U.

The non&para;<br>obstante provision suggests that pre-emption analysis&para;<br>should not involve speculation about ways in which fed­&para;<br>eral agency and third-party actions could potentially&para;<br>reconcile federal duties with conflicting state duties.&para;<br>When the “ordinary meaning” of federal law blocks a&para;<br>private party from independently accomplishing what&para;<br>state law requires, that party has established pre-emption.&para;<br>3&para;<br>To be sure, whether a private party can act sufficiently&para;<br>independently under federal law to do what state law&para;<br>requires may sometimes be difficult to determine. But this&para;<br>is not such a case. Before the Manufacturers could satisfy&para;<br>state law, the FDA—a federal agency—had to undertake&para;<br>special effort permitting them to do so. To decide these&para;<br>cases, it is enough to hold that when a party cannot satisfy&para;<br>its state duties without the Federal Government’s special&para;<br>permission and assistance, which is dependent on the&para;<br>exercise of judgment by a federal agency, that party can­&para;<br>not independently satisfy those state duties for pre­&para;<br>emption purposes.&para;<br>Here, state law imposed a duty on the Manufacturers to&para;<br>take a certain action, and federal law barred them from&para;<br>taking that action. The only action the Manufacturers&para;<br>could independently take—asking for the FDA’s help—is&para;<br>not a matter of state-law concern. Mensing and Demahy’s&para;<br>tort claims are pre-empted.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Wyeth is not to the contrary. In that case, as here,&para;<br>the plaintiff contended that a drug manufacturer had&para;<br>breached a state tort-law duty to provide an adequate&para;<br>warning label. 555 U. S., at 559–560. The Court held that&para;<br>the lawsuit was not pre-empted because it was possible for&para;<br>Wyeth, a brand-name drug manufacturer, to comply with&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>both state and federal law. Id., at 572–573.7 Specifically,&para;<br>the CBE regulation, 21 CFR §314.70(c)(6)(iii), permitted a&para;<br>brand-name drug manufacturer like Wyeth “to unilater­&para;<br>ally strengthen its warning” without prior FDA approval.&para;<br>555 U. S., at 573; cf. supra, at 7–8. Thus, the federal&para;<br>regulations applicable to Wyeth allowed the company, of&para;<br>its own volition, to strengthen its label in compliance with&para;<br>its state tort duty.8&para;<br>We recognize that from the perspective of Mensing and&para;<br>Demahy, finding pre-emption here but not in Wyeth makes&para;<br>little sense. Had Mensing and Demahy taken Reglan, the&para;<br>brand-name drug prescribed by their doctors, Wyeth would&para;<br>control and their lawsuits would not be pre-empted. But&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 Wyeth also urged that state tort law “creat[ed] an unacceptable&para;<br>‘obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes&para;<br>and objectives of Congress.’ ” 555 U.

Cf. post, at 16,&para;<br>n. 13 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.).&para;<br>8 The FDA, however, retained the authority to eventually rescind&para;<br>Wyeth’s unilateral CBE changes. Accordingly, the Court noted that&para;<br>Wyeth could have attempted to show, by “clear evidence,” that the FDA&para;<br>would have rescinded any change in the label and thereby demonstrate&para;<br>that it would in fact have been impossible to do under federal law&para;<br>what state law required. Wyeth, supra, at 571. Wyeth offered no such&para;<br>evidence.&para;<br>That analysis is consistent with our holding today. The Court in&para;<br>Wyeth asked what the drug manufacturer could independently do under&para;<br>federal law, and in the absence of clear evidence that Wyeth could not&para;<br>have accomplished what state law required of it, found no pre-emption.&para;<br>The Wyeth Court held that, because federal law accommodated state&para;<br>law duties, “the possibility of impossibility” was “not enough.” Post, at&para;<br>10; see also Rice v.

I cannot agree. We have traditionally held defen&para;<br>dants claiming impossibility to a demanding standard:&para;<br>Until today, the mere possibility of impossibility had not&para;<br>been enough to establish pre-emption.&para;<br>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits—&para;<br>and, the Court assumes, requires—generic-drug manufac&para;<br>turers to propose a label change to the FDA when they&para;<br>believe that their labels are inadequate.

Once that occurs, a generic&para;<br>manufacturer is in full compliance with both federal law&para;<br>and a state-law duty to warn. Although generic manufac&para;<br>turers may be able to show impossibility in some cases,&para;<br>petitioners, generic manufacturers of metoclopramide&para;<br>(Manufacturers), have shown only that they might have&para;<br>been unable to comply with both federal law and their&para;<br>state-law duties to warn respondents Gladys Mensing and&para;<br>Julie Demahy. This, I would hold, is insufficient to sus&para;<br>tain their burden.&para;<br>The Court strains to reach the opposite conclusion. It&para;<br>invents new principles of pre-emption law out of thin air to&para;<br>justify its dilution of the impossibility standard. It effec&para;<br>tively rewrites our decision in Wyeth v.

As a result of today’s decision, whether&para;<br>a consumer harmed by inadequate warnings can obtain&para;<br>relief turns solely on the happenstance of whether her&para;<br>pharmacist filled her prescription with a brand-name or&para;<br>generic drug.

The dominant position of&para;<br>generic drugs in the prescription drug market is the result&para;<br>of a series of legislative measures, both federal and state.&para;<br>In 1984, Congress enacted the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, 98 Stat. 1585—&para;<br>commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

Ante, at 5–6;&para;<br>see also 21 U. S. C. §355(j)(2)(A). The abbreviated ap&para;<br>proval process implements the amendments’ core principle&para;<br>that generic and brand-name drugs must be the “same” in&para;<br>nearly all respects: To obtain FDA approval, a generic&para;<br>manufacturer must ordinarily show, among other things,&para;<br>that its product has the same active ingredients as an&para;<br>approved brand-name drug; that “the route of adminis&para;<br>tration, the dosage form, and the strength of the new&para;<br>drug are the same” as the brand-name drug; and that its&para;<br>product is “bioequivalent” to the brand-name drug.&para;<br>§§355(j)(2)(A)(ii), (iii), (iv).

And, second, they&para;<br>may approach the FDA to propose a label change when&para;<br>they believe a change is required.&para;<br>II&para;<br>This brings me to the Manufacturers’ pre-emption de&para;<br>fense. State law obliged the Manufacturers to warn of&para;<br>dangers to users. See Hines v. Remington Arms Co., 94–&para;<br>0455, p. 10 (La. 12/8/94), 648 So. 2d 331, 337; Frey v.&para;<br>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., 258 N. W. 2d 782, 788 (Minn.&para;<br>1977). The Manufacturers contend, and the majority&para;<br>agrees, that federal law pre-empts respondents’ failure-to&para;<br>warn claims because, under federal law, the Manufac&para;<br>turers could not have provided additional warnings to&para;<br>respondents without the exercise of judgment by the FDA.&para;<br>I cannot endorse this novel conception of impossibility&para;<br>pre-emption.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Two principles guide all pre-emption analysis. First,&para;<br>“ ‘the purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in&para;<br>every pre-emption case.’ ” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 565 (quoting&para;<br>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485 (1996)). Sec&para;<br>ond, “ ‘[i]n all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those&para;<br>in which Congress has legislated . . . in a field which the&para;<br>States have traditionally occupied, . . . we start with the&para;<br>assumption that the historic police powers of the States&para;<br>were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that&para;<br>was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.’ ” Wyeth,&para;<br>555 U. S., at 565 (quoting Lohr, 518 U. S., at 485; some&para;<br>internal quotation marks omitted; alterations in original).&para;<br>These principles find particular resonance in these&para;<br>cases. The States have traditionally regulated health and&para;<br>safety matters. See id., at 485. Notwithstanding Con&para;<br>gress’ “certain awareness of the prevalence of state tort&para;<br>litigation” against drug manufacturers, Wyeth, 555 U. S.,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>at 575, Congress has not expressly pre-empted state-law&para;<br>tort actions against prescription drug manufacturers,&para;<br>whether brand-name or generic. To the contrary, when&para;<br>Congress amended the FDCA in 1962 to “enlarg[e] the&para;<br>FDA’s powers to ‘protect the public health’ and ‘assure the&para;<br>safety, effectiveness, and reliability of drugs,’ [it] took care&para;<br>to preserve state law.” Id., at 567 (quoting 76 Stat. 780);&para;<br>see Pub. L. 87–781, §202, 76 Stat. 793 (“Nothing in the&para;<br>amendments made by this Act to the [FDCA] shall be&para;<br>construed as invalidating any provision of State law which&para;<br>would be valid in the absence of such amendments unless there is a direct and positive conflict between such&para;<br>amendments and such provision of State law”). Notably,&para;<br>although Congress enacted an express pre-emption provi&para;<br>sion for medical devices in 1976, see Pub. L. 94–295, §521,&para;<br>90 Stat. 574, 21 U. S.

Having failed to do so, the Manufac&para;<br>turers cannot sustain their burden (at least not without&para;<br>further factual development) to demonstrate that it was&para;<br>impossible for them to comply with both federal and state&para;<br>law. At most, they have demonstrated only “a hypotheti&para;<br>cal or potential conflict.” Rice, 458 U. S., at 659.&para;<br>Like the majority, the Manufacturers focus on the fact&para;<br>that they cannot change their labels unilaterally—which&para;<br>distinguishes them from the brand-name-manufacturer&para;<br>defendant in Wyeth. They correctly point out that in&para;<br>Wyeth we concluded that the FDA’s CBE regulation au&para;<br>thorized the defendant to strengthen its warnings before&para;<br>receiving agency approval of its supplemental application&para;<br>describing the label change. 555 U. S., at 568–571; see&para;<br>also 21 CFR §314.70(c)(6). But the defendant’s label&para;<br>change was contingent on FDA acceptance, as the FDA&para;<br>retained “authority to reject labeling changes made pur&para;<br>suant to the CBE regulation.” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 571.&para;<br>Thus, in the long run, a brand-name manufacturer’s com&para;<br>pliance with a state-law duty to warn required action by&para;<br>two actors: The brand-name manufacturer had to change&para;<br>the label and the FDA, upon reviewing the supplemental&para;<br>application, had to agree with the change.10 The need for&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 At&para;<br>&para;<br>the time respondents’ cause of action arose, the FDA did not have&para;<br>authority to require a brand-name manufacturer to change its label.&para;<br>(It received that authority in 2007. See Pub. L. 110–85, §901, 121&para;<br>Stat. 924–926, 21 U. S. C. §355(o)(4) (2006 ed., Supp. III). It did, how&para;<br>ever, have the equally significant authority to withdraw the brand-name&para;<br>manufacturer’s permission to market its drug if the manufacturer&para;<br>refused to make a requested labeling change.

MENSING&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>FDA approval of the label change did not make compliance&para;<br>with federal and state law impossible in every case. In&para;<br>stead, because the defendant bore the burden to show&para;<br>impossibility, we required it to produce “clear evidence&para;<br>that the FDA would not have approved a change to [the]&para;<br>label.” Ibid.&para;<br>I would apply the same approach in these cases. State&para;<br>law, respondents allege, required the Manufacturers to&para;<br>provide a strengthened warning about the dangers of&para;<br>long-term metoclopramide use.11 Just like the brand-name&para;<br>manufacturer in Wyeth, the Manufacturers had available&para;<br>to them a mechanism for attempting to comply with their&para;<br>state-law duty to warn. Federal law thus “accommodated”&para;<br>the Manufacturers’ state-law duties. See ante, at 18, n. 8.&para;<br>It was not necessarily impossible for the Manufacturers to&para;<br>comply with both federal and state law because, had they&para;<br>approached the FDA, the FDA may well have agreed that&para;<br>a label change was necessary. Accordingly, as in Wyeth, I&para;<br>would require the Manufacturers to show that the FDA&para;<br>would not have approved a proposed label change. They&para;<br>have not made such a showing: They do “not argue that&para;<br>[they] attempted to give the kind of warning required by&para;<br>[state law] but [were] prohibited from doing so by the&para;<br>FDA.” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 572.&para;<br>This is not to say that generic manufacturers could&para;<br>never show impossibility. If a generic-manufacturer de&para;<br>fendant proposed a label change to the FDA but the FDA&para;<br>rejected the proposal, it would be impossible for that&para;<br>defendant to comply with a state-law duty to warn. Like&para;<br>wise, impossibility would be established if the FDA had&para;<br>——————&para;<br>would have approved or disapproved the label change. The claim in&para;<br>Wyeth does not appear to have arisen during that period.&para;<br>11 Respondents’ state-law claim is not that the Manufacturers were&para;<br>required to ask the FDA for assistance in changing the labels; the role&para;<br>of the FDA arises only as a result of the Manufacturers’ pre-emption&para;<br>defense.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

A&para;<br>generic manufacturer might also show that the FDA had&para;<br>itself considered whether to request enhanced warnings in&para;<br>light of the evidence on which a plaintiff’s claim rests but&para;<br>had decided to leave the warnings as is. (The Manufac&para;<br>turers make just such an argument in these cases. See,&para;<br>e.g., Brief for Petitioner Actavis et al. 11.) But these are&para;<br>questions of fact to be established through discovery.&para;<br>Because the burden of proving impossibility falls on the&para;<br>defendant, I would hold that federal law does not render&para;<br>it impossible for generic manufacturers to comply with&para;<br>a state-law duty to warn as a categorical matter.&para;<br>This conclusion flows naturally from the overarching prin&para;<br>ciples governing our pre-emption doctrine. See supra,&para;<br>at 8. Our “respect for the States as ‘independent sover&para;<br>eigns in our federal system’ leads us to assume that ‘Con&para;<br>gress does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of&para;<br>action.’ ” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 565–566, n. 3 (quoting Lohr,&para;<br>518 U. S., at 485). It is for this reason that we hold defen&para;<br>dants asserting impossibility to a “demanding” standard.&para;<br>Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 573. This presumption against pre&para;<br>emption has particular force when the Federal Govern&para;<br>ment has afforded defendants a mechanism for complying&para;<br>with state law, even when that mechanism requires fed&para;<br>eral agency action. (The presumption has even greater&para;<br>force when federal law requires defendants to invoke that&para;<br>mechanism, as the majority assumes in these cases.) In&para;<br>such circumstances, I would hold, defendants will usually&para;<br>be unable to sustain their burden of showing impossibility&para;<br>if they have not even attempted to employ that mecha&para;<br>nism. Any other approach threatens to infringe the&para;<br>States’ authority over traditional matters of state inter&para;<br>est—such as the failure-to-warn claims here—when Con&para;<br>gress expressed no intent to pre-empt state law.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>C&para;<br>The majority concedes that the Manufacturers might&para;<br>have been able to accomplish under federal law what state&para;<br>law requires. Ante, at 12–13. To reach the conclusion that&para;<br>the Manufacturers have nonetheless satisfied their bur&para;<br>den to show impossibility, the majority invents a new pre&para;<br>emption rule: “The question for ‘impossibility’ is whether&para;<br>the private party could independently do under federal&para;<br>law what state law requires of it.” Ante, at 13 (emphasis added). Because the Manufacturers could not have&para;<br>changed their labels without the exercise of judgment by&para;<br>the FDA, the majority holds, compliance with both state&para;<br>and federal law was impossible in these cases.12&para;<br>The majority’s new test has no basis in our precedents.&para;<br>The majority cites only Wyeth in support of its test. As&para;<br>discussed above, however, Wyeth does not stand for the&para;<br>proposition that it is impossible to comply with both fed&para;<br>eral and state law whenever federal agency approval is&para;<br>required. To the contrary, label changes by brand-name&para;<br>manufacturers such as Wyeth are subject to FDA review&para;<br>and acceptance. See supra, at 11–12. And, even if Wyeth&para;<br>could be characterized as turning on the fact that the&para;<br>brand-name manufacturer could change its label unilater&para;<br>ally, the possibility of unilateral action was, at most, a&para;<br>sufficient condition for rejecting the impossibility defense&para;<br>in that case. Wyeth did not hold that unilateral action is a&para;<br>necessary condition in every case.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 These cases do not involve a situation where a brand-name&para;<br>manufacturer itself produces generic drugs. See Okie, Multinational&para;<br>Medicines—Ensuring Drug Quality in an Era of Global Manufactur&para;<br>ing, 361 N. Eng. J.

None of the&para;<br>rationales that it offers, however, makes any sense. First,&para;<br>it offers a reductio ad absurdum: If the possibility of FDA&para;<br>approval of a label change is sufficient to avoid conflict in&para;<br>these cases, it warns, as a “logical conclusion” so too would&para;<br>be the possibility that the FDA might rewrite its regula&para;<br>tions or that Congress might amend the Hatch-Waxman&para;<br>Amendments. Ante, at 14. The logic of this conclusion&para;<br>escapes me. Conflict analysis necessarily turns on exist&para;<br>ing law. It thus would be ridiculous to conclude that&para;<br>federal and state law do not conflict on the ground that the&para;<br>defendant could have asked a federal agency or Congress&para;<br>to change the law. Here, by contrast, the Manufacturers’&para;<br>compliance with their state-law duty to warn did not re&para;<br>quire them to ask for a change in federal law, as the&para;<br>majority itself recognizes. See ante, at 13 (“[F]ederal law&para;<br>would permit the Manufacturers to comply with the state&para;<br>labeling requirements if, and only if, the FDA and the&para;<br>brand-name manufacturer changed the brand-name label&para;<br>to do so”). The FDA already afforded them a mechanism&para;<br>for attempting to comply with their state-law duties.&para;<br>Indeed, the majority assumes that FDA regulations re&para;<br>quired the Manufacturers to request a label change when&para;<br>they had “reasonable evidence of an association of a seri&para;<br>ous hazard with a drug.” 21 CFR §201.57(e).&para;<br>Second, the majority suggests that any other approach&para;<br>would render conflict pre-emption “illusory” and “meaning&para;<br>less.” Ante, at 14. It expresses concern that, without a&para;<br>robust view of what constitutes conflict, the Supremacy&para;<br>Clause would not have “any force” except in cases of ex&para;<br>press pre-emption. Ibid. To the extent the majority’s&para;<br>purported concern is driven by its reductio ad absurdum,&para;<br>see ante, at 14, n. 6, that concern is itself illusory, for the&para;<br>reasons just stated. To the extent the majority is con&para;<br>cerned that our traditionally narrow view of what consti&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tutes impossibility somehow renders conflict pre-emption&para;<br>as a whole meaningless, that concern simply makes no&para;<br>sense: We have repeatedly recognized that conflict pre&para;<br>emption may be found, even absent impossibility, where&para;<br>state law “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment&para;<br>and execution of the full purposes and objectives of&para;<br>Congress.” Crosby, 530 U. S., at 373 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted); see, e.g., Geier v. American Honda Motor&para;<br>Co., 529 U. S. 861, 886 (2000); Barnett Bank of Marion&para;<br>Cty., N. A. v. Nelson, 517 U. S. 25, 31 (1996); Hines v.&para;<br>Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941). The majority’s ex&para;<br>pansive view of impossibility is thus unnecessary to pre&para;<br>vent conflict pre-emption from losing all meaning.13&para;<br>Third, a plurality of the Court adopts the novel theory&para;<br>that the Framers intended for the Supremacy Clause to&para;<br>operate as a so-called non obstante provision. See ante, at&para;<br>15–17 (citing Nelson, Preemption, 86 Va. L. Rev. 225&para;<br>(2000)).

For more than half&para;<br>a century, we have directed courts to presume that con&para;<br>gressional action does not supersede “the historic police&para;<br>powers of the States . . . unless that was the clear and&para;<br>manifest purpose of Congress.” Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator&para;<br>Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947); see also Gade, 505 U. S.,&para;<br>at 111–112 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concur&para;<br>ring in judgment). We apply this presumption against&para;<br>pre-emption both where Congress has spoken to the pre&para;<br>emption question and where it has not. See Wyeth, 555&para;<br>U. S., at 566, n. 3. In the context of express pre-emption,&para;<br>we read federal statutes whenever possible not to pre&para;<br>empt state law. See Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U. S.&para;<br>70, 77 (2008) (“[W]hen the text of a pre-emption clause&para;<br>is susceptible of more than one plausible reading, courts&para;<br>ordinarily ‘accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption’ ”&para;<br>(quoting Bates v.

And, when the claim is that federal&para;<br>law impliedly pre-empts state law, we require a “strong”&para;<br>showing of a conflict “to overcome the presumption that&para;<br>state and local regulation . . . can constitutionally coexist&para;<br>with federal regulation.” Hillsborough County v.

And whereas we have long required evidence of a&para;<br>“clear and manifest” purpose to pre-empt, Rice, 331 U.

Given the longstanding&para;<br>existence of product liability actions, including for failure&para;<br>to warn, “[i]t is difficult to believe that Congress would,&para;<br>without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse&para;<br>for those injured by illegal conduct.” Silkwood, 464 U.

If a con&para;<br>sumer takes a brand-name drug, she can sue the manufac&para;<br>turer for inadequate warnings under our opinion in Wyeth.&para;<br>If, however, she takes a generic drug, as occurs 75 percent&para;<br>of the time, she now has no right to sue. The majority&para;<br>offers no reason to think—apart from its new articulation&para;<br>of the impossibility standard—that Congress would have&para;<br>intended such an arbitrary distinction. In some States,&para;<br>pharmacists must dispense generic drugs absent instruc&para;<br>tion to the contrary from a consumer’s physician. Even&para;<br>when consumers can request brand-name drugs, the price&para;<br>of the brand-name drug or the consumers’ insurance plans&para;<br>may make it impossible to do so. As a result, in many&para;<br>cases, consumers will have no ability to preserve their&para;<br>state-law right to recover for injuries caused by inade&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>quate warnings.&para;<br>Second, the majority’s decision creates a gap in the&para;<br>parallel federal-state regulatory scheme in a way that&para;<br>could have troubling consequences for drug safety. As we&para;<br>explained in Wyeth, “[s]tate tort suits uncover unknown&para;<br>drug hazards and provide incentives for drug manufactur&para;<br>ers to disclose safety risks promptly.” 555 U. S., at 579.&para;<br>Thus, we recognized, “state law offers an additional, and&para;<br>important, layer of consumer protection that complements&para;<br>FDA regulation.” Ibid. Today’s decision eliminates the&para;<br>traditional state-law incentives for generic manufacturers&para;<br>to monitor and disclose safety risks. When a generic drug&para;<br>has a brand-name equivalent on the market, the brand&para;<br>name manufacturer will remain incentivized to uncover&para;<br>safety risks. But brand-name manufacturers often leave&para;<br>the market once generic versions are available, see supra,&para;<br>at 4–5, meaning that there will be no manufacturer sub&para;<br>ject to failure-to-warn liability. As to those generic drugs,&para;<br>there will be no “additional . . . layer of consumer protec&para;<br>tion.” Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 579.&para;<br>Finally, today’s decision undoes the core principle of&para;<br>the Hatch-Waxman Amendments that generic and brand&para;<br>name drugs are the “same” in nearly all respects.15 See&para;<br>Brief for Rep.

To the contrary, because fed&para;<br>eral law affords generic manufacturers a mechanism for&para;<br>attempting to comply with their state-law duties to warn,&para;<br>I would hold that federal law does not categorically&para;<br>pre-empt state-law failure-to-warn claims against generic&para;<br>manufacturers. Especially in light of the presumption&para;<br>against pre-emption, the burden should fall on generic&para;<br>manufacturers to show that compliance was impossible on&para;<br>the particular facts of their case. By holding that the&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>PLIVA, INC. v. MENSING&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“possibility of possibility” is insufficient to “defea[t]” pre&para;<br>emption in these cases, ante, at 18, n. 8, the Court contorts&para;<br>our pre-emption doctrine and exempts defendants from&para;<br>their burden to establish impossibility. With respect,&para;<br>I dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
