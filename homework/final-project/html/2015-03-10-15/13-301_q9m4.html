The balance struck in this Court’s&para;<br>prior cases supports a requirement that a summons objector offer not&para;<br>just naked allegations, but some credible evidence to support his&para;<br>claim of improper motive.

However, that ruling is entitled to deference only if it was based on the correct legal standard. See Fox v. Vice, 563&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___.

MICHAEL &para;<br>&para;<br>CLARKE ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[June 19, 2014] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS or Service) has broad&para;<br>statutory authority to summon a taxpayer to produce&para;<br>documents or give testimony relevant to determining tax&para;<br>liability. If the taxpayer fails to comply, the IRS may&para;<br>petition a federal district court to enforce the summons.&para;<br>In an enforcement proceeding, the IRS must show that it&para;<br>issued the summons in good faith.&para;<br>This case requires us to consider when a taxpayer, as&para;<br>part of such a proceeding, has a right to question IRS&para;<br>officials about their reasons for issuing a summons. We&para;<br>hold, contrary to the Court of Appeals below, that a bare&para;<br>allegation of improper purpose does not entitle a taxpayer&para;<br>to examine IRS officials. Rather, the taxpayer has a right&para;<br>to conduct that examination when he points to specific&para;<br>facts or circumstances plausibly raising an inference of&para;<br>bad faith.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Congress has “authorized and required” the IRS “to&para;<br>make the inquiries, determinations, and assessments of&para;<br>all taxes” the Internal Revenue Code imposes. 26 U. S. C.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. CLARKE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§6201(a). And in support of that authority, Congress has&para;<br>granted the Service broad latitude to issue summonses&para;<br>“[f]or the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any&para;<br>return, making a return where none has been made, determining the liability of any person for any internal&para;<br>revenue tax . . . , or collecting any such liability.”&para;<br>§7602(a). Such a summons directs a taxpayer (or associated person1) to appear before an IRS official and to provide sworn testimony or produce “books, papers, records,&para;<br>or other data . . . relevant or material to [a tax] inquiry.”&para;<br>§7602(a)(1).&para;<br>If a taxpayer does not comply with a summons, the IRS&para;<br>may bring an enforcement action in district court. See&para;<br>§§7402(b), 7604(a). In that proceeding, we have held, the&para;<br>IRS “need only demonstrate good faith in issuing the&para;<br>summons.” United States v. Stuart, 489 U. S. 353, 359&para;<br>(1989). More specifically, that means establishing what&para;<br>have become known as the Powell factors: “that the investigation will be conducted pursuant to a legitimate purpose, that the inquiry may be relevant to the purpose, that&para;<br>the information sought is not already within the [IRS’s]&para;<br>possession, and that the administrative steps required by&para;<br>the [Internal Revenue] Code have been followed.” United&para;<br>States v. Powell, 379 U. S. 48, 57–58 (1964). To make that&para;<br>showing, the IRS usually files an affidavit from the responsible investigating agent. See Stuart, 489 U. S., at&para;<br>360. The taxpayer, however, has an opportunity to challenge that affidavit, and to urge the court to quash the&para;<br>&para;<br>summons “on any appropriate ground”—including, as&para;<br>&para;<br>relevant here, improper purpose. See Reisman v. Caplin, &para;<br>&para;<br>375 U. S. 440, 449 (1964). &para;<br>&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>1 The IRS has authority to summon not only “the person liable for&para;<br>tax,” but also “any officer or employee of such person,” any person&para;<br>having custody of relevant “books of account,” and “any other person&para;<br>the [IRS] may deem proper.” 26 U. S. C. §7602(a)(2). For convenience,&para;<br>this opinion refers only to the “taxpayer.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The summons dispute in this case arose from an IRS&para;<br>examination of the tax returns of Dynamo Holdings Limited Partnership (Dynamo) for the 2005–2007 tax years.&para;<br>The IRS harbored suspicions about large interest expenses&para;<br>that those returns had reported. As its investigation&para;<br>proceeded, the Service persuaded Dynamo to agree to two&para;<br>year-long extensions of the usual 3-year limitations period&para;<br>for assessing tax liability; in 2010, with that period again&para;<br>drawing to a close, Dynamo refused to grant the IRS a&para;<br>third extension. Shortly thereafter, in September and&para;<br>October 2010, the IRS issued summonses to the respondents here, four individuals associated with Dynamo whom&para;<br>the Service believed had information and records relevant&para;<br>to Dynamo’s tax obligations. None of the respondents&para;<br>complied with those summonses. In December 2010 (still&para;<br>within the augmented limitations period), the IRS issued a&para;<br>Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment proposing&para;<br>changes to Dynamo’s returns that would result in greater&para;<br>tax liability. Dynamo responded in February 2011 by&para;<br>filing suit in the United States Tax Court to challenge the&para;<br>adjustments. That litigation remains pending. A few&para;<br>months later, in April 2011, the IRS instituted proceedings in District Court to compel the respondents to comply&para;<br>with the summonses they had gotten.&para;<br>Those enforcement proceedings developed into a dispute&para;<br>about the IRS’s reasons for issuing the summonses. The&para;<br>IRS submitted an investigating agent’s affidavit attesting&para;<br>to the Powell factors; among other things, that declaration&para;<br>maintained that the testimony and records sought were&para;<br>necessary to “properly investigate the correctness of [Dynamo’s] federal tax reporting” and that the summonses&para;<br>were “not issued to harass or for any other improper purpose.” App. 26, 34. In reply, the respondents pointed to&para;<br>circumstantial evidence that, in their view, suggested&para;<br>“ulterior motive[s]” of two different kinds. App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 72a. First, the respondents asserted that the IRS&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. CLARKE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>issued the summonses to “punish[ ] [Dynamo] for refusing&para;<br>to agree to a further extension of the applicable statute of&para;<br>limitations.” App. 52. More particularly, they stated in&para;<br>sworn declarations that immediately after Dynamo declined to grant a third extension of time, the IRS, “despite&para;<br>having not asked for additional information for some time,&para;<br>. . . suddenly issued” the summonses. Id., at 95. Second,&para;<br>the respondents averred that the IRS decided to enforce&para;<br>the summonses, subsequent to Dynamo’s filing suit in Tax&para;<br>Court, to “evad[e] the Tax Court[’s] limitations on discovery” and thus gain an unfair advantage in that litigation.&para;<br>Id., at 53. In support of that charge, the respondents&para;<br>submitted an affidavit from the attorney of another Dynamo associate, who had chosen to comply with a summons issued at the same time. The attorney reported that&para;<br>only the IRS attorneys handling the Tax Court case, and&para;<br>not the original investigating agents, were present at the&para;<br>interview of his client. In light of those submissions, the&para;<br>respondents asked for an opportunity to question the&para;<br>agents about their motives.&para;<br>The District Court denied that request and ordered the&para;<br>respondents to comply with the summonses. According to&para;<br>the court, the respondents “ha[d] made no meaningful&para;<br>allegations of improper purpose” warranting examination&para;<br>of IRS agents. App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a. The court characterized the respondents’ statute-of-limitations theory as&para;<br>“mere conjecture.” Id., at 14a. And it ruled that the respondents’ evasion-of-discovery-limits claim was “incorrect&para;<br>as a matter of law” because “[t]he validity of a summons is&para;<br>tested as of the date of issuance,” not enforcement—and&para;<br>the Tax Court proceedings had not yet begun when the&para;<br>IRS issued the summonses. Id., at 15a.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed,&para;<br>holding that the District Court’s refusal to allow the respondents to examine IRS agents constituted an abuse of&para;<br>discretion. In support of that ruling, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cited binding Circuit precedent holding that a simple&para;<br>“allegation of improper purpose,” even if lacking any “factual support,” entitles a taxpayer to “question IRS officials&para;<br>concerning the Service’s reasons for issuing the summons.”&para;<br>517 Fed. Appx. 689, 691 (2013) (quoting United States v.&para;<br>Southeast First Nat. Bank of Miami Springs, 655 F. 2d&para;<br>661, 667 (CA5 1981)); see Nero Trading, LLC v. United&para;<br>States Dept. of Treasury, 570 F. 3d 1244, 1249 (CA11 2009)&para;<br>(reaffirming Southeast).&para;<br>Every other Court of Appeals has rejected the Eleventh&para;<br>Circuit’s view that a bare allegation of improper motive&para;<br>entitles a person objecting to an IRS summons to examine&para;<br>the responsible officials.2 We granted certiorari to resolve&para;<br>that conflict, 571 U. S. __ (2014), and we now vacate the&para;<br>Eleventh Circuit’s opinion.&para;<br>II&para;<br>A person receiving an IRS summons is, as we have often&para;<br>held, entitled to contest it in an enforcement proceeding.&para;<br>See United States v. Bisceglia, 420 U. S. 141, 146 (1975);&para;<br>Powell, 379 U. S., at 57–58; Reisman, 375 U. S., at 449.&para;<br>The power “vested in tax collectors may be abused, as all&para;<br>power” may be abused. Bisceglia, 420 U. S., at 146. In&para;<br>recognition of that possibility, Congress made enforcement&para;<br>of an IRS summons contingent on a court’s approval. See&para;<br>26 U. S. C. §7604(b). And we have time and again stated&para;<br>that the requisite judicial proceeding is not ex parte but&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 See, e.g., Sugarloaf Funding, LLC v. United States Dept. of Treasury, 584 F. 3d 340, 350–351 (CA1 2009) (requiring “a sufficient threshold showing that there was an improper purpose”); Fortney v. United&para;<br>States, 59 F. 3d 117, 121 (CA9 1995) (requiring “some minimal amount&para;<br>of evidence” beyond “mere memoranda of law or allegations” (internal&para;<br>quotations and alterations omitted)); United States v. Kis, 658 F. 2d&para;<br>526, 540 (CA7 1981) (requiring “develop[ment] [of] facts from which a&para;<br>court might infer a possibility of some wrongful conduct”); United&para;<br>States v. Garden State Nat. Bank, 607 F. 2d 61, 71 (CA3 1979) (requiring “factual[ ] support[ ] by the taxpayer’s affidavits”).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. CLARKE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>adversarial. See Donaldson v. United States, 400 U. S.&para;<br>517, 527 (1971); Powell, 379 U. S., at 58; Reisman, 375&para;<br>U. S., at 446. The summoned party must receive notice,&para;<br>and may present argument and evidence on all matters&para;<br>bearing on a summons’s validity. See Powell, 379 U. S.,&para;<br>at 58.&para;<br>Yet we have also emphasized that summons enforcement proceedings are to be “summary in nature.” Stuart,&para;<br>489 U. S., at 369. The purpose of a summons is “not to&para;<br>accuse,” much less to adjudicate, but only “to inquire.”&para;<br>Bisceglia, 420 U. S., at 146. And such an investigatory&para;<br>tool, we have recognized, is a crucial backstop in a tax&para;<br>system based on self-reporting. See ibid. (restricting&para;<br>summons authority would enable “dishonest persons [to]&para;<br>escap[e] taxation[,] thus shifting heavier burdens to honest taxpayers”). Accordingly, we long ago held that courts&para;<br>may ask only whether the IRS issued a summons in good&para;<br>faith, and must eschew any broader role of “oversee[ing]&para;<br>the [IRS’s] determinations to investigate.” Powell, 379&para;<br>U. S., at 56. So too, we stated that absent contrary evidence, the IRS can satisfy that standard by submitting a&para;<br>simple affidavit from the investigating agent. See Stuart,&para;<br>489 U. S., at 359–360. Thus, we have rejected rules that&para;<br>would “thwart and defeat the [Service’s] appropriate&para;<br>investigatory powers.” Donaldson, 400 U. S., at 533.&para;<br>The balance we have struck in prior cases comports with&para;<br>the following rule, applicable here: As part of the adversarial process concerning a summons’s validity, the taxpayer is entitled to examine an IRS agent when he can&para;<br>point to specific facts or circumstances plausibly raising&para;<br>an inference of bad faith. Naked allegations of improper&para;<br>purpose are not enough: The taxpayer must offer some&para;<br>credible evidence supporting his charge. But circumstantial evidence can suffice to meet that burden; after all,&para;<br>direct evidence of another person’s bad faith, at this&para;<br>threshold stage, will rarely if ever be available. And&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>although bare assertion or conjecture is not enough, neither is a fleshed out case demanded: The taxpayer need&para;<br>only make a showing of facts that give rise to a plausible&para;<br>inference of improper motive. That standard will ensure&para;<br>inquiry where the facts and circumstances make inquiry&para;<br>appropriate, without turning every summons dispute into&para;<br>a fishing expedition for official wrongdoing. And the rule&para;<br>is little different from the one that both the respondents&para;<br>and the Government have recommended to us.3&para;<br>But that is not the standard the Eleventh Circuit applied. Although the respondents gamely try to put another face on the opinion below, see Brief for Respondents&para;<br>24–25, and n. 17, we have no doubt that the Court of Appeals&para;<br>viewed even bare allegations of improper purpose as entitling a summons objector to question IRS agents. The&para;<br>court in fact had some evidence before it pertaining to the&para;<br>respondents’ charges: The respondents, for example, had&para;<br>submitted one declaration relating the timing of the summonses to Dynamo’s refusal to extend the limitations&para;<br>period, see App. 95, and another aiming to show that the&para;<br>IRS was using the summonses to obtain discovery it could&para;<br>not get in Tax Court, see id., at 97–100. But the Eleventh&para;<br>Circuit never assessed whether those (or any other) materials plausibly supported an inference of improper motive;&para;<br>indeed, the court never mentioned the proffered evidence&para;<br>at all. Instead, and in line with Circuit precedent, the&para;<br>court applied a categorical rule, demanding the examination of IRS agents even when a taxpayer made only conclusory allegations. See supra, at 4. That was error. On&para;<br>remand, the Court of Appeals must consider the respond——————&para;<br>3 See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29 (respondents) (The taxpayer is entitled to&para;<br>question the agent “when he presents specific facts from which an&para;<br>improper purpose . . . may plausibly be inferred”); id., at 5 (United&para;<br>States) (“[A] summons opponent has to put in enough evidence to at&para;<br>least raise an inference” of improper motive, and “[c]ircumstantial&para;<br>evidence is enough”).&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. CLARKE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ents’ submissions in light of the standard we have stated.&para;<br>That consideration must as well give appropriate deference to the District Court’s ruling. An appellate court, as&para;<br>the Eleventh Circuit noted, reviews for abuse of discretion&para;<br>a trial court’s decision to order—or not—the questioning of&para;<br>IRS agents. See 517 Fed. Appx., at 691, n. 2; Tiffany Fine&para;<br>Arts, Inc. v. United States, 469 U. S. 310, 324, n. 7 (1985).&para;<br>That standard of review reflects the district court’s superior familiarity with, and understanding of, the dispute; and&para;<br>it comports with the way appellate courts review related&para;<br>matters of case management, discovery, and trial practice. See, e.g., Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. v. Sperling, 493&para;<br>U. S. 165, 172–173 (1989); Crawford-El v. Britton, 523&para;<br>U. S. 574, 599–601 (1998). Accordingly, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals must take into account on remand the District&para;<br>Court’s broad discretion to determine whether a taxpayer has shown enough to require the examination of IRS&para;<br>investigators.&para;<br>But two caveats to that instruction are in order here.&para;<br>First, the District Court’s decision is entitled to deference&para;<br>only if based on the correct legal standard. See Fox v.&para;<br>Vice, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 11) (“A trial&para;<br>court has wide discretion when, but only when, it calls the&para;<br>game by the right rules”). We leave to the Court of Appeals the task of deciding whether the District Court&para;<br>asked and answered the relevant question—once again,&para;<br>whether the respondents pointed to specific facts or circumstances plausibly raising an inference of improper&para;<br>motive.&para;<br>And second, the District Court’s latitude does not extend&para;<br>to legal issues about what counts as an illicit motive. As&para;<br>indicated earlier, one such issue is embedded in the respondents’ claim that the Government moved to enforce&para;<br>these summonses to gain an unfair advantage in Tax&para;<br>Court litigation. See supra, at 4. The Government responds, and the District Court agreed, that any such&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>purpose is irrelevant because “the validity of a summons is&para;<br>judged at the time” the IRS originally issued the summons, and here that preceded the Tax Court suit. Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 7; see Reply Brief 19–20; App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>15a. Similarly, with respect to the respondents’ alternative theory, the Government briefly suggested at argument that issuing a summons because “a taxpayer declined to extend a statute of limitations would [not] be an&para;<br>improper purpose,” even assuming that happened here.&para;<br>Tr. of Oral Arg. 6. We state no view on those issues; they&para;<br>are not within the question presented for our review. We&para;<br>note only that they are pure questions of law, so if they&para;<br>arise again on remand, the Court of Appeals has no cause&para;<br>to defer to the District Court. Cf. Koon v. United States,&para;<br>518 U. S. 81, 100 (1996) (“A district court by definition&para;<br>abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law”).&para;<br>For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of the Court&para;<br>of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings&para;<br>consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
