JICARILLA APACHE NATION&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–382.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued April 20, 2011—Decided June 13, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent Jicarilla Apache Nation’s (Tribe) reservation contains&para;<br>natural resources that are developed pursuant to statutes adminis&para;<br>tered by the Interior Department. Proceeds from these resources are&para;<br>held by the United States in trust for the Tribe. The Tribe filed a&para;<br>breach-of-trust action in the Court of Federal Claims (CFC), seeking&para;<br>monetary damages for the Government’s alleged mismanagement of&para;<br>the Tribe’s trust funds in violation of 25 U. S. C. §§161–162a and&para;<br>other laws. During discovery, the Tribe moved to compel production&para;<br>of certain documents. The Government agreed to release some of the&para;<br>documents, but asserted that others were protected by, inter alia, the&para;<br>attorney-client privilege. The CFC granted the motion in part, hold&para;<br>ing that departmental communications relating to the management&para;<br>of trust funds fall within a “fiduciary exception” to the attorney-client&para;<br>privilege. Under that exception, which courts have applied to com&para;<br>mon-law trusts, a trustee who obtains legal advice related to trust&para;<br>administration is precluded from asserting the attorney-client privi&para;<br>lege against trust beneficiaries.&para;<br>Denying the Government’s petition for a writ of mandamus direct&para;<br>ing the CFC to vacate its production order, the Federal Circuit&para;<br>agreed with the CFC that the trust relationship between the United&para;<br>States and the Indian tribes is sufficiently similar to a private trust&para;<br>to justify applying the fiduciary exception. The appeals court held&para;<br>that the United States cannot deny a tribe’s request to discover com&para;<br>munications between the Government and its attorneys based on the&para;<br>attorney-client privilege when those communications concern man&para;<br>agement of an Indian trust and the Government has not claimed that&para;<br>it or its attorneys considered a specific competing interest in those&para;<br>communications.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege does not&para;<br>apply to the general trust relationship between the United States&para;<br>and the Indian tribes. Pp. 5–24.&para;<br>(a) The Court considers the bounds of the fiduciary exception and&para;<br>the nature of the Indian trust relationship. Pp. 5–14.&para;<br>(1) Under English common law, when a trustee obtained legal&para;<br>advice to guide his trust administration and not for his own defense&para;<br>in litigation, the beneficiaries were entitled to the production of&para;<br>documents related to that advice on the rationale that the advice was&para;<br>sought for their benefit and obtained at their expense in that trust&para;<br>funds were used to pay the attorney. In the leading American case,&para;<br>Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D. C. v. Zimmer, 355 A. 2d 709, the&para;<br>Delaware Chancery Court applied the fiduciary exception to hold that&para;<br>trust beneficiaries could compel trustees to produce a legal memo&para;<br>randum related to the trust’s administration because: (1) the trustees&para;<br>had obtained the legal advice as “mere representative[s]” of the bene&para;<br>ficiaries, who were the “real clients” of the attorney, id., at 711–712,&para;<br>and (2) the fiduciary duty to furnish trust-related information to the&para;<br>beneficiaries outweighed the trustees’ interest in the attorney-client&para;<br>privilege, id., at 714. The Federal Courts of Appeals apply the fiduci&para;<br>ary exception based on the same two criteria. Pp. 6–9.&para;<br>(2) The Federal Circuit analogized the Government to a private&para;<br>trustee. While the United States’ responsibilities with respect to the&para;<br>management of tribal funds bear some resemblance to those of a pri&para;<br>vate trustee, this analogy cannot be taken too far. The Government’s&para;<br>trust obligations to the tribes are established and governed by stat&para;<br>ute, not the common law, see, e.g., United States v. Navajo Nation,&para;<br>537 U. S. 488, 506 (Navajo I), and in fulfilling its statutory duties,&para;<br>the Government acts not as a private trustee, but pursuant to its&para;<br>sovereign interest in the execution of federal law, see, e.g., Heckman&para;<br>v. United States, 224 U. S. 413, 437. Once federal law imposes fidu&para;<br>ciary obligations on the Government, the common law “could play a&para;<br>role,” United States v. Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (Navajo II);&para;<br>e.g., to inform the interpretation of statutes, see United States v.&para;<br>White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 475–476. But the ap&para;<br>plicable statutes and regulations control. When “the Tribe cannot&para;<br>identify a specific, applicable, trust-creating statute or regulation&para;<br>that the Government violated . . . neither the Government’s ‘control’&para;<br>over [Indian assets] nor common-law trust principles matter.” Na&para;<br>vajo II, supra, at ___. Pp. 9–14.&para;<br>(b) The two criteria justifying the fiduciary exception are absent in&para;<br>the trust relationship between the United States and Indian tribes.&para;<br>Pp. 14–23.&para;<br>(1) In cases applying the fiduciary exception, courts identify the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>“real client” based on whether the advice was bought by the trust&para;<br>corpus, whether the trustee had reason to seek advice in a personal&para;<br>rather than a fiduciary capacity, and whether the advice could have&para;<br>been intended for any purpose other than to benefit the trust. Riggs,&para;<br>355 A. 2d, at 711–712. Applying these factors, the Court concludes&para;<br>that the United States does not obtain legal advice as a “mere repre&para;<br>sentative” of the Tribe; nor is the Tribe the “real client” for whom&para;<br>that advice is intended. See id., at 711. Here, the Government at&para;<br>torneys are paid out of congressional appropriations at no cost to the&para;<br>Tribe. The Government also seeks legal advice in its sovereign capac&para;<br>ity rather than as a conventional fiduciary of the Tribe. Because its&para;<br>sovereign interest is distinct from the beneficiaries’ private interests,&para;<br>the Government seeks legal advice in a personal, not a fiduciary, ca&para;<br>pacity. Moreover, the Government has too many competing legal&para;<br>concerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into each communication’s&para;<br>purpose. In addition to its duty to the Tribe, the Government may&para;<br>need to comply with other statutory duties, such as environmental&para;<br>and conservation obligations. It may also face conflicting duties to&para;<br>different tribes or individual Indians. It may seek the advice of coun&para;<br>sel for guidance in balancing these competing interests or to help de&para;<br>termine whether there are conflicting interests at all. For the attor&para;<br>ney-client privilege to be effective, it must be predictable. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Jaffee v. Redmond, 518 U. S. 1, 18. The Government will not always&para;<br>be able to predict what considerations qualify as competing interests,&para;<br>especially before receiving counsel’s advice. If the Government were&para;<br>required to identify the specific interests it considered in each com&para;<br>munication, its ability to receive confidential legal advice would be&para;<br>substantially compromised. See Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449&para;<br>U. S. 383, 393. Pp. 15–20.&para;<br>(2) The Federal Circuit also decided that the fiduciary exception&para;<br>properly applied here because of the fiduciary’s duty to disclose all&para;<br>trust-management-related information to the beneficiary. The Gov&para;<br>ernment, however, does not have the same common-law disclosure&para;<br>obligations as a private trustee. In this case, 25 U. S. C. §162a(d) de&para;<br>lineates the Government’s “trust responsibilities.” It identifies the&para;<br>Interior Secretary’s obligation to supply tribal account holders “with&para;<br>periodic statements of their account performance” and to make&para;<br>“available on a daily basis” their account balances, §162a(d)(5). The&para;<br>Secretary has complied with these requirements in regulations man&para;<br>dating that each tribe be provided with a detailed quarterly state&para;<br>ment of performance. 25 CFR pt. 115.8. The common law of trusts&para;<br>does not override these specific trust-creating statutes and regula&para;<br>tions. A statutory clause labeling the enumerated trust responsibili&para;<br>ties as nonexhaustive, see §162a(d), cannot be read to include a gen&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>eral common-law duty to disclose all information related to the ad&para;<br>ministration of Indian trusts, since that would vitiate Congress’&para;<br>specification of narrowly defined disclosure obligations, see, e.g.,&para;<br>Mackey v. Lanier Collection Riggs Agency &amp; Service, Inc., 486 U. S.&para;<br>825, 837. By law and regulation, moreover, the documents at issue&para;<br>are classed “the property of the United States” while other records&para;<br>are “the property of the tribe.” 25 CFR §115.1000. This Court con&para;<br>siders ownership of records to be a significant factor in deciding who&para;<br>“ought to have access to the document,” Riggs, supra, at 712. Here,&para;<br>that privilege belongs to the United States.

The common law, however, has recognized an excep&para;<br>tion to the privilege when a trustee obtains legal advice&para;<br>related to the exercise of fiduciary duties. In such cases,&para;<br>courts have held, the trustee cannot withhold attorney&para;<br>client communications from the beneficiary of the trust.&para;<br>In this case, we consider whether the fiduciary exception&para;<br>applies to the general trust relationship between the&para;<br>United States and the Indian tribes. We hold that it does&para;<br>not. Although the Government’s responsibilities with re&para;<br>spect to the management of funds belonging to Indian&para;<br>tribes bear some resemblance to those of a private trustee,&para;<br>this analogy cannot be taken too far. The trust obligations&para;<br>of the United States to the Indian tribes are established&para;<br>and governed by statute rather than the common law, and&para;<br>in fulfilling its statutory duties, the Government acts not&para;<br>as a private trustee but pursuant to its sovereign interest&para;<br>in the execution of federal law. The reasons for the fiduci&para;<br>ary exception—that the trustee has no independent inter&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>est in trust administration, and that the trustee is subject&para;<br>to a general common-law duty of disclosure—do not apply&para;<br>in this context.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Jicarilla Apache Nation (Tribe) occupies a 900,000&para;<br>acre reservation in northern New Mexico that was estab&para;<br>lished by Executive Order in 1887. The land contains&para;<br>timber, gravel, and oil and gas reserves, which are devel&para;<br>oped pursuant to statutes administered by the Depart&para;<br>ment of the Interior. Proceeds derived from these natural&para;<br>resources are held by the United States in trust for the&para;<br>Tribe pursuant to the American Indian Trust Fund Man&para;<br>agement Reform Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4239, and other&para;<br>statutes.&para;<br>In 2002, the Tribe commenced a breach-of-trust action&para;<br>against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims&para;<br>(CFC). The Tribe sued under the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1491 (2006 ed. and Supp. III), and the Indian Tucker Act,&para;<br>§1505, which vest the CFC with jurisdiction over claims&para;<br>against the Government that are founded on the Constitu&para;<br>tion, laws, treaties, or contracts of the United States. The&para;<br>complaint seeks monetary damages for the Government’s&para;<br>alleged mismanagement of funds held in trust for the&para;<br>Tribe. The Tribe argues that the Government violated&para;<br>various laws, including 25 U. S. C. §§161a and 162a, that&para;<br>govern the management of funds held in trust for Indian&para;<br>tribes. See 88 Fed. Cl. 1, 3 (2009).&para;<br>From December 2002 to June 2008, the Government&para;<br>and the Tribe participated in alternative dispute resolu&para;<br>tion in order to resolve the claim. During that time, the&para;<br>Government turned over thousands of documents but&para;<br>withheld 226 potentially relevant documents as protected&para;<br>by the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work-product&para;<br>doctrine, or the deliberative-process privilege.&para;<br>In 2008, at the request of the Tribe, the case was re&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>stored to the active litigation docket. The CFC divided the&para;<br>case into phases for trial and set a discovery schedule.&para;<br>The first phase, relevant here, concerns the Government’s&para;<br>management of the Tribe’s trust accounts from 1972 to&para;<br>1992. The Tribe alleges that during this period the Gov&para;<br>ernment failed to invest its trust funds properly. Among&para;<br>other things, the Tribe claims the Government failed to&para;<br>maximize returns on its trust funds, invested too heavily&para;<br>in short-term maturities, and failed to pool its trust&para;<br>funds with other tribal trusts. During discovery, the Tribe&para;<br>moved to compel the Government to produce the 226&para;<br>withheld documents. In response, the Government agreed&para;<br>to withdraw its claims of deliberative-process privilege&para;<br>and, accordingly, to produce 71 of the documents. But the&para;<br>Government continued to assert the attorney-client privi&para;<br>lege and attorney work-product doctrine with respect to&para;<br>the remaining 155 documents. The CFC reviewed those&para;<br>documents in camera and classified them into five cate&para;<br>gories: (1) requests for legal advice relating to trust ad&para;<br>ministration sent by personnel at the Department of the&para;<br>Interior to the Office of the Solicitor, which directs legal&para;<br>affairs for the Department, (2) legal advice sent from the&para;<br>Solicitor’s Office to personnel at the Interior and Treasury Departments, (3) documents generated under con&para;<br>tracts between Interior and an accounting firm, (4) Inte&para;<br>rior documents concerning litigation with other tribes, and&para;<br>(5) miscellaneous documents not falling into the other&para;<br>categories.&para;<br>The CFC granted the Tribe’s motion to compel in part.&para;<br>The CFC held that communications relating to the man&para;<br>agement of trust funds fall within a “fiduciary exception”&para;<br>to the attorney-client privilege. Under that exception,&para;<br>which courts have applied in the context of common-law&para;<br>trusts, a trustee who obtains legal advice related to the&para;<br>execution of fiduciary obligations is precluded from assert&para;<br>ing the attorney-client privilege against beneficiaries of&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the trust. The CFC concluded that the trust relationship&para;<br>between the United States and the Indian tribes is suffi&para;<br>ciently analogous to a common-law trust relationship that&para;<br>the exception should apply. Accordingly, the CFC held,&para;<br>the United States may not shield from the Tribe commu&para;<br>nications with attorneys relating to trust matters.&para;<br>The CFC ordered disclosure of almost all documents in&para;<br>the first two categories because those documents “involve&para;<br>matters regarding the administration of tribal trusts,&para;<br>either directly or indirectly implicating the investments&para;<br>that benefit Jicarilla” and contain “legal advice relating to&para;<br>trust administration.” Id., at 14–15. The CFC allowed&para;<br>the Government to withhold most of the documents in the&para;<br>remaining categories as attorney work product,1 but the&para;<br>court identified some individual documents that it deter&para;<br>mined were also subject to the fiduciary exception. Id., at&para;<br>18–19.&para;<br>The Government sought to prevent disclosure of the&para;<br>documents by petitioning the Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Federal Circuit for a writ of mandamus directing the CFC&para;<br>to vacate its production order. The Court of Appeals de&para;<br>nied the petition because, in its view, the CFC correctly&para;<br>applied the fiduciary exception. The court held that “the&para;<br>United States cannot deny an Indian tribe’s request to&para;<br>discover communications between the United States and&para;<br>its attorneys based on the attorney-client privilege when&para;<br>those communications concern management of an Indian&para;<br>trust and the United States has not claimed that the&para;<br>government or its attorneys considered a specific com&para;<br>peting interest in those communications.” In re United&para;<br>States, 590 F. 3d 1305, 1313 (CA Fed. 2009). In qualifying&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>CFC held that there is no fiduciary exception to the work&para;<br>product doctrine. 88 Fed. Cl. 1, 12 (2009).

But because&para;<br>the Government had not alleged that the legal advice in&para;<br>this case related to such conflicting interests, the court&para;<br>reserved judgment on how the fiduciary exception might&para;<br>apply in that situation. The court rejected the Govern&para;<br>ment’s argument that, because its duties to the Indian&para;<br>tribes were governed by statute rather than the common&para;<br>law, it had no general duty of disclosure that would over&para;<br>ride the attorney-client privilege. The court also disagreed&para;<br>with the Government’s contention that a case-by-case&para;<br>approach made the attorney-client privilege too unpredict&para;<br>able and would impair the Government’s ability to obtain&para;<br>confidential legal advice.&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 562 U.

Unless applicable law provides other&para;<br>wise, the Government may invoke the attorney-client&para;<br>privilege in civil litigation to protect confidential commu&para;<br>nications between Government officials and Government&para;<br>attorneys. Id., at 574 (“[G]overnmental agencies and&para;<br>employees enjoy the same privilege as nongovernmental&para;<br>counterparts”). The Tribe argues, however, that the&para;<br>common law also recognizes a fiduciary exception to the&para;<br>attorney-client privilege and that, by virtue of the trust&para;<br>relationship between the Government and the Tribe,&para;<br>documents that would otherwise be privileged must be&para;<br>disclosed. As preliminary matters, we consider the bounds&para;<br>of the fiduciary exception and the nature of the trust&para;<br>relationship between the United States and the Indian&para;<br>tribes.&para;<br>A&para;<br>English courts first developed the fiduciary exception as&para;<br>a principle of trust law in the 19th century. The rule was&para;<br>that when a trustee obtained legal advice to guide the&para;<br>administration of the trust, and not for the trustee’s own&para;<br>defense in litigation, the beneficiaries were entitled to the&para;<br>production of documents related to that advice.

By the 1970’s,&para;<br>however, American courts began to adopt the English&para;<br>common-law rule. See Garner v.

Id., at 712.&para;<br>Applying the common-law fiduciary exception, the court&para;<br>held that the memorandum was discoverable. It identified&para;<br>two reasons for applying the exception.&para;<br>First, the court explained, the trustees had obtained the&para;<br>legal advice as “mere representative[s]” of the beneficiar&para;<br>ies because the trustees had a fiduciary obligation to act in&para;<br>the beneficiaries’ interest when administering the trust.&para;<br>Ibid. For that reason, the beneficiaries were the “real&para;<br>clients” of the attorney who had advised the trustee on&para;<br>trust-related matters, and therefore the attorney-client&para;<br>privilege properly belonged to the beneficiaries rather&para;<br>than the trustees. Id., at 711–712. The court based its&para;<br>“real client” determination on several factors: (1) when the&para;<br>advice was sought, no adversarial proceedings between the&para;<br>trustees and beneficiaries had been pending, and therefore&para;<br>there was no reason for the trustees to seek legal advice in&para;<br>a personal rather than a fiduciary capacity; (2) the court&para;<br>saw no indication that the memorandum was intended for&para;<br>any purpose other than to benefit the trust; and (3) the&para;<br>law firm had been paid out of trust assets. That the ad&para;<br>vice was obtained at the beneficiaries’ expense was not&para;<br>only a “significant factor” entitling the beneficiaries to see&para;<br>the document but also “a strong indication of precisely&para;<br>who the real clients were.” Id., at 712. The court distin&para;<br>guished between “legal advice procured at the trustee’s&para;<br>own expense and for his own protection,” which would&para;<br>remain privileged, “and the situation where the trust itself&para;<br>is assessed for obtaining opinions of counsel where inter&para;<br>ests of the beneficiaries are presently at stake.” Ibid. In&para;<br>the latter case, the fiduciary exception applied, and the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>trustees could not withhold those attorney-client commu&para;<br>nications from the beneficiaries.&para;<br>Second, the court concluded that the trustees’ fiduciary&para;<br>duty to furnish trust-related information to the benefi&para;<br>ciaries outweighed their interest in the attorney-client&para;<br>privilege. “The policy of preserving the full disclosure&para;<br>necessary in the trustee-beneficiary relationship,” the court&para;<br>explained, “is here ultimately more important than the&para;<br>protection of the trustees’ confidence in the attorney for&para;<br>the trust.” Id., at 714. Because more information helped&para;<br>the beneficiaries to police the trustees’ management of the&para;<br>trust, disclosure was, in the court’s judgment, “a weight&para;<br>ier public policy than the preservation of confidential&para;<br>attorney-client communications.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Federal Courts of Appeals apply the fiduciary ex&para;<br>ception based on the same two criteria. See, e.g., In re&para;<br>Long Island Lighting Co., 129 F. 3d 268, 272 (CA2 1997);&para;<br>Wachtel v. Health Net, Inc., 482 F. 3d 225, 233–234 (CA3&para;<br>2007); Solis v. Food Employers Labor Relations Assn.,&para;<br>2011 U. S. App. LEXIS 9110, *12 (CA4, May 4, 2011);&para;<br>Wildbur v. Arco Chemical Co., 974 F. 2d 631, 645 (CA5&para;<br>1992); United States v. Evans, 796 F. 2d 264, 265–266&para;<br>(CA9 1986) (per curiam). Not until the decision below had&para;<br>a federal appellate court held the exception to apply to the&para;<br>United States as trustee for the Indian tribes.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In order to apply the fiduciary exception in this case, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals analogized the Government to a private&para;<br>trustee. 590 F. 3d, at 1313. We have applied that analogy&para;<br>in limited contexts, see, e.g., United States v. Mitchell, 463&para;<br>U. S. 206, 226 (1983) (Mitchell II), but that does not mean&para;<br>the Government resembles a private trustee in every&para;<br>respect. On the contrary, this Court has previously noted&para;<br>that the relationship between the United States and the&para;<br>Indian tribes is distinctive, “different from that existing&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>between individuals whether dealing at arm’s length, as&para;<br>trustees and beneficiaries, or otherwise.” Klamath and&para;<br>Moadoc Tribes v. United States, 296 U. S. 244, 254 (1935)&para;<br>(emphasis added). “The general relationship between the&para;<br>United States and the Indian tribes is not comparable to a&para;<br>private trust relationship.” Cherokee Nation of Okla. v.&para;<br>United States, 21 Cl. Ct. 565, 573 (1990) (emphasis added).&para;<br>The Government, of course, is not a private trustee.&para;<br>Though the relevant statutes denominate the relationship&para;<br>between the Government and the Indians a “trust,” see,&para;<br>e.g., 25 U. S. C. §162a, that trust is defined and governed&para;<br>by statutes rather than the common law. See United&para;<br>States v. Navajo Nation, 537 U. S. 488, 506 (2003)&para;<br>(Navajo I) (“[T]he analysis must train on specific rights&para;<br>creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory pre&para;<br>scriptions”). As we have recognized in prior cases, Con&para;<br>gress may style its relations with the Indians a “trust”&para;<br>without assuming all the fiduciary duties of a private&para;<br>trustee, creating a trust relationship that is “limited” or&para;<br>“bare” compared to a trust relationship between private&para;<br>parties at common law. United States v. Mitchell, 445&para;<br>U. S. 535, 542 (1980) (Mitchell I); Mitchell II, supra, at&para;<br>224.4&para;<br>The difference between a private common-law trust and&para;<br>the statutory Indian trust follows from the unique position&para;<br>of the Government as sovereign.

United States, 16 Cl. Ct.&para;<br>107, 127, n. 17 (1987) (“[T]he provisions relating to private trustees and&para;<br>fiduciaries, while useful as analogies, cannot be regarded as finally&para;<br>dispositive in a government-Indian trustee-fiduciary relationship”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

Candelaria, 271 U. S. 432, 439&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(1926); Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286, 315&para;<br>(1911).&para;<br>Because the Indian trust relationship represents an&para;<br>exercise of that authority, we have explained that the&para;<br>Government “has a real and direct interest” in the guardi&para;<br>anship it exercises over the Indian tribes; “the interest is&para;<br>one which is vested in it as a sovereign.” United States v.&para;<br>Minnesota, 270 U. S. 181, 194 (1926). This is especially so&para;<br>because the Government has often structured the trust&para;<br>relationship to pursue its own policy goals. Thus, while&para;<br>trust administration “relat[es] to the welfare of the Indi&para;<br>ans, the maintenance of the limitations which Congress&para;<br>has prescribed as a part of its plan of distribution is dis&para;<br>tinctly an interest of the United States.” Heckman v.&para;<br>United States, 224 U. S. 413, 437 (1912); see also Cande&para;<br>laria, supra, at 443–444.&para;<br>In Heckman, the Government brought suit to cancel&para;<br>certain conveyances of allotted lands by members of an&para;<br>Indian tribe because the conveyances violated restrictions&para;<br>on alienation imposed by Congress. This Court explained&para;<br>that the Government brought suit as the representative of&para;<br>the very Indian grantors whose conveyances it sought to&para;<br>cancel, and those Indians were thereby bound by the&para;<br>judgment. 224 U. S., at 445–446. But while it was for&para;<br>mally acting as a trustee, the Government was in fact&para;<br>asserting its own sovereign interest in the disposition of&para;<br>Indian lands, and the Indians were precluded from inter&para;<br>vening in the litigation to advance a position contrary to&para;<br>that of the Government. Id., at 445. Such a result was&para;<br>possible because the Government assumed a fiduciary role&para;<br>over the Indians not as a common-law trustee but as the&para;<br>governing authority enforcing statutory law.&para;<br>We do not question “the undisputed existence of a gen&para;<br>eral trust relationship between the United States and the&para;<br>Indian people.” Mitchell II, 463 U. S., at 225. The Gov&para;<br>ernment, following “a humane and self imposed policy . . .&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>has charged itself with moral obligations of the highest&para;<br>responsibility and trust,” Seminole Nation v. United&para;<br>States, 316 U. S. 286, 296–297 (1942), obligations “to the&para;<br>fulfillment of which the national honor has been commit&para;<br>ted,” Heckman, supra, at 437. Congress has expressed&para;<br>this policy in a series of statutes that have defined and&para;<br>redefined the trust relationship between the United States&para;<br>and the Indian tribes. In some cases, Congress estab&para;<br>lished only a limited trust relationship to serve a narrow&para;<br>purpose. See Mitchell I, 445 U. S., at 544 (Congress in&para;<br>tended the United States to hold land “ ‘in trust’ ” under&para;<br>the General Allotment Act “simply because it wished to&para;<br>prevent alienation of the land and to ensure that allottees&para;<br>would be immune from state taxation”); Navajo I, 537&para;<br>U. S., at 507–508 (Indian Mineral Leasing Act imposes no&para;<br>“detailed fiduciary responsibilities” nor is the Government&para;<br>“expressly invested with responsibility to secure ‘the needs&para;<br>and best interests of the Indian owner’ ”).&para;<br>In other cases, we have found that particular “statutes&para;<br>and regulations . . . clearly establish fiduciary obligations&para;<br>of the Government” in some areas. Mitchell II, supra, at&para;<br>226; see also United States v. White Mountain Apache&para;<br>Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 475 (2003). Once federal law imposes&para;<br>such duties, the common law “could play a role.” United&para;<br>States v. Navajo Nation, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (Navajo&para;<br>II) (slip op., at 14). We have looked to common-law princi&para;<br>ples to inform our interpretation of statutes and to deter&para;<br>mine the scope of liability that Congress has imposed. See&para;<br>White Mountain Apache Tribe, supra, at 475–476. But the&para;<br>applicable statutes and regulations “establish [the] fiduci&para;<br>ary relationship and define the contours of the United&para;<br>States’ fiduciary responsibilities.” Mitchell II, supra, at&para;<br>224. When “the Tribe cannot identify a specific, applica&para;<br>ble, trust-creating statute or regulation that the Govern&para;<br>ment violated, . . . neither the Government’s ‘control’ over&para;<br>[Indian assets] nor common-law trust principles matter.”&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Navajo II, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14).5 The Government&para;<br>assumes Indian trust responsibilities only to the extent it&para;<br>expressly accepts those responsibilities by statute.6&para;<br>Over the years, we have described the federal relation&para;<br>ship with the Indian tribes using various formulations.&para;<br>The Indian tribes have been called “domestic dependent&para;<br>nations,” Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 17 (1831),&para;<br>under the “tutelage” of the United States, Heckman, su&para;<br>pra, at 444, and subject to “the exercise of the Govern&para;<br>ment’s guardianship over . . . their affairs,” United States&para;<br>v. Sandoval, 231 U. S. 28, 48 (1913). These concepts do&para;<br>not necessarily correspond to a common-law trust rela&para;<br>tionship. See, e.g., Restatement 2d, §7 (“A guardianship is&para;<br>not a trust”). That is because Congress has chosen to&para;<br>structure the Indian trust relationship in different ways.&para;<br>We will apply common-law trust principles where Con&para;<br>gress has indicated it is appropriate to do so. For that&para;<br>reason, the Tribe must point to a right conferred by stat&para;<br>ute or regulation in order to obtain otherwise privileged&para;<br>information from the Government against its wishes.&para;<br>III&para;<br>In this case, the Tribe’s claim arises from 25 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§161–162a and the American Indian Trust Fund Man&para;<br>agement Reform Act of 1994, §4001 et seq. These pro&para;<br>visions define “the trust responsibilities of the United&para;<br>States” with respect to tribal funds. §162a(d). The Court&para;<br>of Appeals concluded that the trust relationship between&para;<br>the United States and the Indian tribes, outlined in these&para;<br>and other statutes, is “sufficiently similar to a private&para;<br>trust to justify applying the fiduciary exception.” 590&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Thus, the dissent’s reliance on the Government’s “managerial con&para;<br>trol,” post, at 8 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.), is misplaced.&para;<br>6 Cf. Restatement 2d, §25, Comment a (“[A]lthough the settlor has&para;<br>called the transaction a trust[,] no trust is created unless he manifests&para;<br>an intention to impose duties which are enforceable in the courts”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>F. 3d, at 1313. We disagree.&para;<br>As we have discussed, the Government exercises its&para;<br>carefully delimited trust responsibilities in a sovereign&para;<br>capacity to implement national policy respecting the In&para;<br>dian tribes. The two features justifying the fiduciary&para;<br>exception—the beneficiary’s status as the “real client” and&para;<br>the trustee’s common-law duty to disclose information&para;<br>about the trust—are notably absent in the trust relation&para;<br>ship Congress has established between the United States&para;<br>and the Tribe.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Court of Appeals applied the fiduciary exception&para;<br>based on its determination that the Tribe rather than&para;<br>the Government was the “real client” with respect to the&para;<br>Government attorneys’ advice. Ibid. In cases applying the&para;<br>fiduciary exception, courts identify the “real client” based&para;<br>on whether the advice was bought by the trust corpus,&para;<br>whether the trustee had reason to seek advice in a per&para;<br>sonal rather than a fiduciary capacity, and whether the&para;<br>advice could have been intended for any purpose other&para;<br>than to benefit the trust. Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 711–712.&para;<br>Applying these factors, we conclude that the United States&para;<br>does not obtain legal advice as a “mere representative” of&para;<br>the Tribe; nor is the Tribe the “real client” for whom that&para;<br>advice is intended. See ibid.&para;<br>Here, the Government attorneys are paid out of con&para;<br>gressional appropriations at no cost to the Tribe. Courts&para;<br>look to the source of funds as a “strong indicator of pre&para;<br>cisely who the real clients were” and a “significant factor”&para;<br>in determining who ought to have access to the legal&para;<br>advice. Id., at 712. We similarly find it significant that&para;<br>the attorneys were paid by the Government for advice&para;<br>regarding the Government’s statutory obligations.&para;<br>The payment structure confirms our view that the Gov&para;<br>ernment seeks legal advice in its sovereign capacity rather&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>than as a conventional fiduciary of the Tribe. Undoubt&para;<br>edly, Congress intends the Indian tribes to benefit from&para;<br>the Government’s management of tribal trusts. That&para;<br>intention represents “a humane and self imposed policy”&para;<br>based on felt “moral obligations.” Seminole Nation, 316&para;<br>U. S., at 296–297. This statutory purpose does not imply a&para;<br>full common-law trust, however. Cf. Restatement 2d, §25,&para;<br>Comment b (“No trust is created if the settlor manifests an&para;<br>intention to impose merely a moral obligation”). Congress&para;<br>makes such policy judgments pursuant to its sovereign&para;<br>governing authority, and the implementation of federal&para;<br>policy remains “distinctly an interest of the United&para;<br>States.” Heckman, 224 U. S., at 437.7 We have said that&para;<br>“the United States continue[s] as trustee to have an active&para;<br>interest” in the disposition of Indian assets because the&para;<br>terms of the trust relationship embody policy goals of the&para;<br>United States. McKay v. Kalyton, 204 U. S. 458, 469&para;<br>(1907).&para;<br>In some prior cases, we have found that the Government&para;<br>had established the trust relationship in order to impose&para;<br>its own policy on Indian lands. See Mitchell I, 445 U. S.,&para;<br>at 544 (Congress “intended that the United States ‘hold&para;<br>the land . . . in trust’ . . . because it wished to prevent&para;<br>alienation of the land”). In other cases, the Government&para;<br>has invoked its trust relationship to prevent state inter&para;<br>ference with its policy toward the Indian tribes. See Min&para;<br>nesota v. United States, 305 U. S. 382, 386 (1939); Cande&para;<br>laria, 271 U. S., at 442–444; United States v. Kagama, 118&para;<br>U. S. 375, 382–384 (1886). And the exercise of federal&para;<br>authority thereby established has often been “left under&para;<br>the acts of Congress to the discretion of the Executive&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 Chief Justice Hughes, writing for a unanimous Court, insisted that&para;<br>the “national interest” in the management of Indian affairs “is not to be&para;<br>expressed in terms of property, or to be limited to the assertion of rights&para;<br>incident to the ownership of a reversion or to the holding of a technical&para;<br>title in trust.” Heckman, 224 U.

In this way, Con&para;<br>gress has designed the trust relationship to serve the&para;<br>interests of the United States as well as to benefit the&para;<br>Indian tribes. See United States v. Rickert, 188 U. S. 432,&para;<br>443 (1903) (trust relationship “ ‘authorizes the adoption on&para;<br>the part of the United States of such policy as their own&para;<br>public interests may dictate’ ” (quoting Choctaw Nation v.&para;<br>United States, 119 U. S. 1, 28 (1886))).8&para;<br>We cannot agree with the Tribe and its amici that “[t]he&para;<br>government and its officials who obtained the advice have&para;<br>no stake in [the] substance of the advice, beyond their&para;<br>trustee role,” Brief for Respondent 9, or that “the United&para;<br>States’ interests in trust administration were identical to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Congress has structured the trust relationship to reflect its consid&para;<br>ered judgment about how the Indians ought to be governed. For&para;<br>example, the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 388, was&para;<br>“a comprehensive congressional attempt to change the role of Indians in&para;<br>American society.” F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law §1.04,&para;<br>p. 77 (2005) (hereinafter Cohen). Congress aimed to promote the&para;<br>assimilation of Indians by dividing Indian lands into individually&para;<br>owned allotments. The federal policy aimed “to substitute a new in&para;<br>dividual way of life for the older Indian communal way.” Id., at 79.&para;<br>The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 984, marked a shift&para;<br>away “from assimilation policies and toward more tolerance and respect&para;<br>for traditional aspects of Indian culture.” Cohen §1.05, at 84. The Act&para;<br>prohibited further allotment and restored tribal ownership. Id., at 86.&para;<br>The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975,&para;<br>88 Stat. 2203, and the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994, 108 Stat.&para;<br>4270, enabled tribes to run health, education, economic development,&para;<br>and social programs for themselves. Cohen §1.07, at 103. This&para;<br>strengthened self-government supported Congress’ decision to author&para;<br>ize tribes to withdraw trust funds from Federal Government control&para;<br>and place the funds under tribal control. American Indian Trust Fund&para;<br>Management Reform Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 4239, 4242–4244; see 25&para;<br>U. S. C. §§4021–4029 (2006 ed. and Supp. III). The control over the&para;<br>Indian tribes that has been exercised by the United States pursuant to&para;<br>the trust relationship—forcing the division of tribal lands, restraining&para;<br>alienation—does not correspond to the fiduciary duties of a common&para;<br>law trustee. Rather, the trust relationship has been altered and&para;<br>administered as an instrument of federal policy.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the interests of the tribal trust fund beneficiaries,” Brief&para;<br>for National Congress of American Indians et al. as Amici&para;<br>Curiae 5. The United States has a sovereign interest in&para;<br>the administration of Indian trusts distinct from the pri&para;<br>vate interests of those who may benefit from its admini&para;<br>stration. Courts apply the fiduciary exception on the&para;<br>ground that “management does not manage for itself.”&para;<br>Garner, 430 F. 2d, at 1101; Wachtel, 482 F. 3d, at 232&para;<br>(“[O]f central importance in both Garner and Riggs was&para;<br>the fiduciary’s lack of a legitimate personal interest in the&para;<br>legal advice obtained”). But the Government is never in&para;<br>that position. While one purpose of the Indian trust rela&para;<br>tionship is to benefit the tribes, the Government has its&para;<br>own independent interest in the implementation of federal&para;<br>Indian policy. For that reason, when the Government&para;<br>seeks legal advice related to the administration of tribal&para;<br>trusts, it establishes an attorney-client relationship re&para;<br>lated to its sovereign interest in the execution of federal&para;<br>law. In other words, the Government seeks legal advice in&para;<br>a “personal” rather than a fiduciary capacity. See Riggs,&para;<br>355 A. 2d, at 711.&para;<br>Moreover, the Government has too many competing&para;<br>legal concerns to allow a case-by-case inquiry into the&para;<br>purpose of each communication. When “multiple inter&para;<br>ests” are involved in a trust relationship, the equivalence&para;<br>between the interests of the beneficiary and the trustee&para;<br>breaks down. Id., at 714. That principle applies with&para;<br>particular force to the Government. Because of the multi&para;<br>ple interests it must represent, “the Government cannot&para;<br>follow the fastidious standards of a private fiduciary, who&para;<br>would breach his duties to his single beneficiary solely by&para;<br>representing potentially conflicting interests without the&para;<br>beneficiary’s consent.” Nevada v.

The Gov&para;<br>ernment may need to comply with other statutory duties,&para;<br>such as the environmental and conservation obligations&para;<br>that the Court of Appeals discussed. See id., at 1314–&para;<br>1315. The Government may also face conflicting obliga&para;<br>tions to different tribes or individual Indians. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Nance v. EPA, 645 F. 2d 701, 711 (CA9 1981) (Federal&para;<br>Government has “conflicting fiduciary responsibilities” to&para;<br>the Northern Cheyenne and Crow Tribes); Hoopa Valley&para;<br>Tribe v. Christie, 812 F. 2d 1097, 1102 (CA9 1986) (“No&para;<br>trust relation exists which can be discharged to the plain&para;<br>tiff here at the expense of other Indians”). Within the&para;<br>bounds of its “general trust relationship” with the Indian&para;<br>people, we have recognized that the Government has&para;<br>“discretion to reorder its priorities from serving a sub&para;<br>group of beneficiaries to serving the broader class of all&para;<br>Indians nationwide.” Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U. S. 182, 195&para;<br>(1993); see also ibid. (“Federal Government ‘does have a&para;<br>fiduciary obligation to the Indians; but it is a fiduciary&para;<br>obligation that is owed to all Indian tribes’ ” (quoting&para;<br>Hoopa Valley Tribe, supra, at 1102)). And sometimes, we&para;<br>have seen, the Government has enforced the trust statutes&para;<br>to dispose of Indian property contrary to the wishes of&para;<br>those for whom it was nominally kept in trust. The Gov&para;<br>ernment may seek the advice of counsel for guidance in&para;<br>balancing these competing interests. Indeed, the point of&para;<br>consulting counsel may be to determine whether conflict&para;<br>ing interests are at stake.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals sought to accommodate the Gov&para;<br>ernment’s multiple obligations by suggesting that the&para;<br>Government may invoke the attorney-client privilege if it&para;<br>identifies “a specific competing interest” that was consid&para;<br>ered in the particular communications it seeks to with&para;<br>hold. 590 F. 3d, at 1313. But the conflicting interests the&para;<br>Government must consider are too pervasive for such a&para;<br>case-by-case approach to be workable.&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We have said that for the attorney-client privilege to be&para;<br>effective, it must be predictable. See Jaffee v. Redmond,&para;<br>518 U. S. 1, 18 (1996); Upjohn, 449 U. S., at 393. If the&para;<br>Government were required to identify the specific inter&para;<br>ests it considered in each communication, its ability to&para;<br>receive confidential legal advice would be substantially&para;<br>compromised. The Government will not always be able to&para;<br>predict what considerations qualify as a “specific compet&para;<br>ing interest,” especially in advance of receiving counsel’s&para;<br>advice. Forcing the Government to monitor all the consid&para;<br>erations contained in each communication with counsel&para;<br>would render its attorney-client privilege “little better&para;<br>than no privilege at all.” Ibid.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Court of Appeals also decided the fiduciary excep&para;<br>tion properly applied to the Government because “the&para;<br>fiduciary has a duty to disclose all information related to&para;<br>trust management to the beneficiary.” 590 F. 3d, at 1312.&para;<br>In general, the common-law trustee of an irrevocable trust&para;<br>must produce trust-related information to the beneficiary&para;<br>on a reasonable basis, though this duty is sometimes&para;<br>limited and may be modified by the settlor.

The enumerated responsibilities include&para;<br>a provision identifying the Secretary’s obligation to pro&para;<br>vide specific information to tribal account holders: The&para;<br>Secretary must “suppl[y] account holders with periodic&para;<br>statements of their account performance” and must make&para;<br>“available on a daily basis” the “balances of their account.”&para;<br>§162a(d)(5). The Secretary has complied with these re&para;<br>quirements by adopting regulations that instruct the&para;<br>Office of Trust Fund Management to provide each tribe&para;<br>with a quarterly statement of performance, 25 CFR&para;<br>§115.801 (2010), that identifies “the source, type, and&para;<br>status of the trust funds deposited and held in a trust&para;<br>account; the beginning balance; the gains and losses;&para;<br>receipts and disbursements; and the ending account bal&para;<br>ance of the quarterly statement period,” §115.803.

Although today’s holding pertains only&para;<br>to a narrow evidentiary issue, I fear the upshot of the&para;<br>majority’s opinion may well be a further dilution of the&para;<br>Government’s fiduciary obligations that will have broader&para;<br>negative repercussions for the relationship between the&para;<br>United States and Indian tribes.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Federal Rule of Evidence 501 provides in relevant part&para;<br>that “the privilege of a . . . government . . . shall be gov&para;<br>erned by the principles of the common law as they may be&para;<br>interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light&para;<br>of reason and experience.” Rule 501 “was adopted pre&para;<br>cisely because Congress wished to leave privilege ques&para;<br>tions to the courts rather than attempt to codify them.”&para;<br>United States v.

But the majority neglects to&para;<br>explain that the privilege is a limited exception to the&para;<br>usual rules of evidence requiring full disclosure of relevant&para;<br>information. See 8 J.

Health&para;<br>Net, Inc., 482 F. 3d 225, 231 (CA3 2007).&para;<br>The fiduciary exception to the attorney-client privilege&para;<br>has its roots in 19th-century English common-law cases&para;<br>holding that, “when a trustee obtained legal advice relat&para;<br>ing to his administration of the trust, and not in antici&para;<br>pation of adversarial legal proceedings against him, the&para;<br>beneficiaries of the trust had the right to the production of&para;<br>that advice.” Ibid.

See, e.g., United States v.&para;<br>Mett, 178 F. 3d 1058, 1063 (CA9 1999) (“ ‘[A]s a represen&para;<br>tative for the beneficiaries of the trust which he is admin&para;<br>istering, the trustee is not the real client in the sense that&para;<br>he is personally being served’ ” (quoting United States v.&para;<br>Evans, 796 F. 2d 264, 266 (CA9 1986) (per curiam)));&para;<br>Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 713 (same). The majority places&para;<br>heavy emphasis on the source of payment for the legal&para;<br>advice, see ante, at 8, 15, but it is well settled that who&para;<br>pays for the legal advice, although “potentially relevant,”&para;<br>“is not determinative in resolving issues of privilege.”&para;<br>Restatement (Third) of Trusts §82, Comment f, p. 188&para;<br>(2005) (hereinafter Third Restatement).

The&para;<br>majority’s conclusion to the contrary rests on flawed fac&para;<br>tual and legal premises.&para;<br>A&para;<br>When the Government seeks legal advice from a gov&para;<br>ernment attorney on matters relating to the management&para;<br>of the Nation’s trust funds, the “real client” of that advice&para;<br>for purposes of the fiduciary exception is the Nation, not&para;<br>the Government. The majority’s rejection of that conclu&para;<br>sion is premised on its erroneous view that the Govern&para;<br>ment, in managing the Nation’s trust funds, “has its own&para;<br>independent interest in the implementation of federal&para;<br>Indian policy” that diverges from the interest of the Na&para;<br>tion as beneficiary. Ante, at 18; see also ante, at 1&para;<br>(GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment).&para;<br>The majority correctly notes that, as a general matter,&para;<br>the Government has sovereign interests in managing&para;<br>Indian trusts that distinguish it from a private trustee.&para;<br>See, e.g., United States v. Minnesota, 270 U. S. 181, 194&para;<br>(1926). Throughout the history of the Federal Govern&para;<br>ment’s dealings with Indian tribes, Congress has altered&para;<br>and administered the trust relationship “as an instrument&para;<br>of federal policy.” Ante, at 17, n. 8 (detailing shifts in&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

Norton, 240 F. 3d 1081,&para;<br>1086–1088 (CADC 2001) (same, and describing that his&para;<br>tory as “contentious and tragic”).&para;<br>In the specific context of Indian trust fund management,&para;<br>however, federal Indian policy entirely aligns the interests&para;<br>of the Government as trustee and the Indian tribe as&para;<br>beneficiary. As explained above, Congress has enacted an&para;<br>extensive network of statutes regulating the Government’s&para;<br>management of Indian trust fund accounts. That statu&para;<br>tory framework establishes a “conventional fiduciary re&para;<br>lationship” in the context of Indian trust fund admini&para;<br>stration. Navajo Nation II, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>14) (internal quotation marks omitted); see supra, at 7–9.&para;<br>As a conventional fiduciary, the Government’s manage&para;<br>ment of Indian trust funds must “be judged by the most&para;<br>exacting fiduciary standards.” Seminole Nation, 316 U. S.,&para;<br>at 296–297. Among the most fundamental fiduciary obli&para;<br>gations of a trustee is “to administer the trust solely in the&para;<br>interest of the beneficiaries.” 2A A. Scott &amp; W. Fratcher,&para;<br>Law of Trusts §170, p. 311 (4th ed. 1987); see Meinhard v.&para;<br>Salmon, 249 N. Y. 458, 464, 164 N. E. 545, 546 (1928)&para;<br>(Cardozo, C. J.) (“Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of&para;<br>an honor the most sensitive,” is “the standard of behavior”&para;<br>for trustees “bound by fiduciary ties”). Although Indian&para;<br>trust funds are deposited in the United States Treasury,&para;<br>“they are not part of the federal government’s general&para;<br>funds and can be used only for the benefit of the tribe.”&para;<br>Cohen §5.03[3][b], at 408, and n. 140 (citing Quick Bear v.&para;<br>Leupp, 210 U.

S. C. §§122, 123)). In other words, any&para;<br>uniquely sovereign interest the Government may have in&para;<br>other contexts of its trust relationship with Indian tribes&para;<br>does not exist in the specific context of Indian trust fund&para;<br>administration. It naturally follows, then, that when the&para;<br>Government seeks legal advice from government attorneys&para;<br>relating to the management of the Nation’s trust funds,&para;<br>the “real client” of the advice for purposes of the fiduciary&para;<br>exception is the Nation, not the Government.&para;<br>This conclusion holds true even though government&para;<br>attorneys are “paid out of congressional appropriations&para;<br>at no cost to the [Nation].” Ante, at 15. As noted above,&para;<br>although the source of funding for legal advice may be&para;<br>relevant, the ultimate inquiry is for whose benefit the&para;<br>legal advice was rendered. See supra, at 4. And, for all&para;<br>the emphasis the majority places on the funding source&para;<br>here, see ante, at 8, 15, the majority never suggests that&para;<br>the fiduciary exception would apply if Congress amended&para;<br>federal law to permit Indian tribes to pay government&para;<br>attorneys out of their own trust funds.6&para;<br>The majority also suggests that, even if the interests of&para;<br>the United States and Indian tribes may be equivalent in&para;<br>some contexts, that “equivalence” “breaks down” when&para;<br>there are “multiple interests” involved in a trust relation&para;<br>ship. Ante, at 18. According to the majority, “the Gov&para;<br>ernment has too many competing legal concerns to allow a&para;<br>case-by-case inquiry into the purpose of each communica&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The majority also states that ownership of the requested documents&para;<br>is “a significant factor” in deciding whether the fiduciary exception&para;<br>applies, ante, at 23, but the only case it cites as support deals with the&para;<br>source of payment for the legal advice, not the ownership of the docu&para;<br>ments. See ibid. (citing Riggs Nat. Bank of Washington, D. C. v.&para;<br>Zimmer, 355 A. 2d 709, 712 (Del. Ch. 1976)).&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tion.” Ibid. As a result, the majority concludes that the&para;<br>fiduciary exception should not be applied at all in the&para;<br>Indian trust context. Ibid.&para;<br>Preliminarily, while the Government in certain circum&para;<br>stances may have sovereign obligations that conflict with&para;<br>its duties as a fiduciary for Indian tribes, see, e.g., Nevada&para;<br>v. United States, 463 U. S. 110 (1983),7 the existence of&para;<br>competing interests is not unique to the Government as&para;<br>trustee. Indeed, the issue of competing interests arises&para;<br>frequently in the private trust context. See, e.g., Third&para;<br>Restatement §78, Comment c, at 97–103 (describing duties&para;<br>of trustee with respect to “transactions that involve con&para;<br>flicting fiduciary and personal interests”); id., §79,&para;<br>Comment b, at 128–129 (describing trustee’s duty of impar&para;<br>tiality in “balancing . . . competing interests” of multiple&para;<br>beneficiaries). In such circumstances, “a trustee—and&para;<br>ultimately a court—may need to provide some response&para;<br>that offers a compromise between the confidentiality or&para;<br>privacy concerns of some and the interest-protection needs&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 In Nevada, the Government represented certain tribes in litigation&para;<br>involving water rights even though it was also required by statute to&para;<br>represent the water rights of a reclamation project. See 463 U. S., at&para;<br>128 (noting that Congress delegated to the Secretary of the Interior&para;<br>“both the responsibility for the supervision of the Indian tribes and the&para;<br>commencement of reclamation projects in areas adjacent to reservation&para;<br>lands”). Because of this dual litigating responsibility, we noted that “it&para;<br>is simply unrealistic to suggest that the Government may not perform&para;<br>its obligation to represent Indian tribes in litigation when Congress has&para;<br>obliged it to represent other interests as well.” Ibid. We thus observed&para;<br>in the context of that case that “the Government cannot follow the&para;<br>fastidious standards of a private fiduciary, who would breach his duties&para;<br>to his single beneficiary solely by representing potentially conflicting&para;<br>interests without the beneficiary’s consent.” Ibid. We expressly distin&para;<br>guished the context “where only a relationship between the Govern&para;<br>ment and the tribe is involved.” Id., at 142. In that context, we ac&para;<br>knowledged that “the law respecting obligations between a trustee and&para;<br>a beneficiary in private litigation will in many, if not all, respects&para;<br>adequately describe the duty of the United States.” Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

The majority&para;<br>provides no reason why federal courts applying the fiduci&para;<br>ary exception in the Indian trust context could not simi&para;<br>larly adopt a workable framework that adequately takes&para;<br>into account any unique governmental interests that bear&para;<br>on the application of the fiduciary exception in any given&para;<br>circumstance. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(2)(C) (au&para;<br>thorizing courts to set limits on discovery based on equita&para;<br>ble concerns).&para;<br>The majority’s categorical rejection of the fiduciary&para;<br>exception in the Indian trust context sweeps far broader&para;<br>than necessary. This case involves only the Government’s&para;<br>alleged mismanagement of the Nation’s trust fund ac&para;<br>counts, and the Government did not claim below that the&para;<br>attorney-client communications at issue relate to any&para;<br>competing governmental obligations. See App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 18a–19a. To the extent the United States in other&para;<br>contexts has competing interests, the Government and its&para;<br>attorneys already have to identify those interests in de&para;<br>termining how to balance them against their obligations to&para;<br>Indian tribes, and attorney-client communications relating&para;<br>to those interests may properly be withheld or redacted&para;<br>consistent with application of the fiduciary exception. See&para;<br>88 Fed. Cl. 1, 13 (2009) (observing that redactions “allo[w]&para;<br>the privilege and exception to reign supreme within their&para;<br>respective spheres”).&para;<br>The majority’s categorical approach fails to appreciate&para;<br>that privilege determinations are by their very nature&para;<br>made on a case-by-case—indeed, document-by-document—&para;<br>basis. Government attorneys, like private counsel, must&para;<br>review each requested document and make an individual&para;<br>ized assessment of privilege, and courts reviewing privi&para;<br>lege logs and challenges must do the same. “While such a&para;<br>‘case-by-case’ basis may to some slight extent undermine&para;<br>desirable certainty in the boundaries of the attorney-client&para;<br>privilege, it obeys the spirit of” of Rule 501, Upjohn, 449&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

On&para;<br>those facts, the fiduciary exception applies to the commu&para;<br>nications in this case.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Like the “real client” rationale, the second rationale for&para;<br>the fiduciary exception, rooted in a trustee’s fiduciary duty&para;<br>to disclose all matters relevant to trust administration to&para;<br>the beneficiary, fully supports disclosure of the communi&para;<br>cations in this case. As explained above, courts relying on&para;<br>this second rationale have recognized that “[t]he policy of&para;<br>preserving the full disclosure necessary in the trustee&para;<br>beneficiary relationship is . . . ultimately more important&para;<br>than the protection of the trustees’ confidence in the at&para;<br>torney for the trust.” Riggs, 355 A. 2d, at 714. Because&para;<br>the statutory scheme requires the Government to act as a&para;<br>conventional fiduciary in managing the Nation’s trust&para;<br>funds, the Government’s fiduciary duty to keep the Nation&para;<br>informed of matters relating to trust administration in&para;<br>cludes the concomitant duty to disclose attorney-client&para;<br>communications relating to trust fund management.

In&para;<br>particular, the majority states that the Government “as&para;<br>sumes Indian trust responsibilities only to the extent it&para;<br>expressly accepts those responsibilities by statute,” and&para;<br>thus the Nation “must point to a right conferred by statute&para;<br>or regulation in order to obtain otherwise privileged in&para;<br>formation from the Government against its wishes.” Ante,&para;<br>at 14.

Because those “narrowly&para;<br>defined disclosure obligations” do not provide Indian tribes&para;<br>with a specific statutory right to disclosure of attorney&para;<br>client communications relating to trust administration,&para;<br>ante, at 22, the majority concludes that the Government&para;<br>has no duty to disclose those communications to the&para;<br>Nation.&para;<br>The majority’s conclusion employs a fundamentally&para;<br>flawed legal premise.

To the&para;<br>contrary, where, as here, the statutory framework estab&para;<br>lishes that the relationship between the Government and&para;<br>an Indian tribe “bears the hallmarks of a conventional&para;<br>fiduciary relationship,” Navajo II, 556 U. S., at __ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 14) (internal quotation marks omitted), we have consis&para;<br>tently looked to general trust principles to flesh out the&para;<br>Government’s fiduciary obligations.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>For example, in United States v. White Mountain&para;<br>Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465 (2003), we construed a statute&para;<br>that vested the Government with discretionary authority&para;<br>to “use” trust property for certain purposes as imposing a&para;<br>concomitant duty to preserve improvements that had&para;<br>previously been made to the land. Id., at 475 (quoting 74&para;<br>Stat. 8). Even though the statute did not “expressly sub&para;<br>ject the Government to duties of management and conser&para;<br>vation,” we construed the Government’s obligations under&para;<br>the statute by reference to “elementary trust law,” which&para;<br>“confirm[ed] the commonsense assumption that a fiduciary&para;<br>actually administering trust property may not allow it to&para;<br>fall into ruin on his watch.” 537 U. S., at 475. Similarly,&para;<br>in Seminole Nation, we relied on general trust principles&para;<br>to conclude that the Government had a fiduciary duty to&para;<br>prevent misappropriation of tribal trust funds by corrupt&para;<br>members of a tribe, even though no specific statutory or&para;<br>treaty provision expressly imposed such a duty. See 316&para;<br>U. S., at 296.8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 To be sure, in decisions involving the jurisdiction of the Court of&para;<br>Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, we have explained that the&para;<br>jurisdictional analysis “must train on specific rights-creating or duty&para;<br>imposing statutory or regulatory prescriptions.” Navajo I, 537 U. S., at&para;<br>506. But even assuming arguendo that those jurisdictional decisions&para;<br>have relevance here, they do not stand for the proposition that the&para;<br>Government’s fiduciary duties are defined exclusively by express&para;<br>statutory provisions. Indeed, those decisions relied specifically on&para;<br>general trust principles to determine whether the relevant statutory&para;<br>scheme permitted a damages remedy, a prerequisite for jurisdiction&para;<br>under the Tucker Act. See, e.g., Mitchell II, 463 U. S., at 226 (noting&para;<br>that common-law trust sources establish that “a trustee is accountable&para;<br>in damages for breaches of trust” and that, “[g]iven the existence of a&para;<br>trust relationship, it naturally follows that the Government should be&para;<br>liable in damages for the breach of its fiduciary duties”); see also&para;<br>Navajo II, 556 U.

This approach accords with our recog&para;<br>nition in other trust contexts that “the primary function of&para;<br>the fiduciary duty is to constrain the exercise of discre&para;<br>tionary powers which are controlled by no other specific&para;<br>duty imposed by the trust instrument or the legal regime.”&para;<br>Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 504 (1996) (emphasis&para;<br>deleted); cf. Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas&para;<br>Pension Fund v. Central Transport, Inc., 472 U. S. 559,&para;<br>570 (1985) (“[R]ather than explicitly enumerating all of&para;<br>the powers and duties of trustees and other fiduciaries,&para;<br>Congress invoked the common law of trusts to define the&para;<br>general scope of their authority and responsibility”).&para;<br>Indeed, “[i]f the fiduciary duty applied to nothing more&para;<br>than activities already controlled by other specific legal&para;<br>duties, it would serve no purpose.” Howe, 516 U.

But despite its assurance that it “will apply&para;<br>common-law trust principles where Congress has indi&para;<br>cated it is appropriate to do so,” ante, at 14, the majority&para;<br>inexplicably rejects the application of common-law trust&para;<br>principles in this case. In doing so, the majority states&para;<br>that “[t]he common law of trusts does not override the&para;<br>specific trust-creating statute and regulations that apply&para;<br>here.” Ante, at 21–22 (referring to §162a(d)(5) and 25 CFR&para;<br>§§115.801–115.803). That statement evidences the major&para;<br>ity’s fundamental misunderstanding of the way in which&para;<br>common-law principles operate in the context of a conven&para;<br>tional fiduciary relationship.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Contrary to the majority’s view, the Government’s dis&para;<br>closure obligations are not limited solely to the “narrowly&para;<br>defined disclosure obligations” set forth in §162a(d)(5) and&para;<br>its implementing regulations, ante, at 22; rather, given&para;<br>that the statutory regime requires the Government to act&para;<br>as a conventional fiduciary in managing Indian trust&para;<br>funds, the Government’s disclosure obligations include&para;<br>those of a fiduciary under common-law trust principles.&para;<br>See supra, at 15–17. Instead of “overrid[ing]” the specific&para;<br>disclosure duty set forth in §162a(d)(5) and its implement&para;<br>ing regulations, general trust principles flesh out the&para;<br>Government’s disclosure obligations under the broader&para;<br>statutory regime, consistent with its role as a conventional&para;<br>fiduciary in this context.&para;<br>This conclusion, moreover, is supported by the plain text&para;<br>of the very statute cited by the majority. Section 162a(d),&para;<br>which was enacted as part of the American Indian Trust&para;<br>Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 (1994 Act), 108&para;<br>Stat. 4239, sets forth eight “trust responsibilities of the&para;<br>United States.” But that provision also specifically states&para;<br>that the Secretary of the Interior’s “proper discharge of the&para;<br>trust responsibilities of the United States shall include&para;<br>(but are not limited to)” those specified duties. 25 U. S. C.&para;<br>§162a(d) (emphasis added). By expressly including the&para;<br>italicized language, Congress recognized that the Govern&para;<br>ment has pre-existing trust responsibilities that arise out&para;<br>of the broader statutory scheme governing the manage&para;<br>ment of Indian trust funds.9 Indeed, Title I of the 1994&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The&para;<br>&para;<br>majority invokes the canon against superfluity and argues that&para;<br>the “catchall” phrase (by which it means the “shall include (but are not&para;<br>limited to)” language) cannot be read to “include a general common-law&para;<br>duty to disclose all information related to the administration of Indian&para;<br>trusts” because doing so would “impose general obligations that would&para;<br>include those specifically enumerated.” Ante, at 22. But the flaw in the&para;<br>majority’s argument is that it misperceives the function of the relevant&para;<br>language. Rather than serving as a “catchall” provision that affirma&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

R. Rep. No. 103–778, p. 9 (1994) (“The responsibility for&para;<br>management of Indian Trust Funds by the [Government]&para;<br>has been determined through a series of court decisions,&para;<br>treaties, and statutes”). That conclusion accords with&para;<br>common sense as not even the Government argues that it&para;<br>had no disclosure obligations with respect to Indian trust&para;<br>funds prior to the enactment of the 1994 Act.10&para;<br>The majority requires the Nation to “point to a right&para;<br>conferred by statute” to the attorney-client communica&para;<br>tions at issue, ante, at 14, and finding none, denies the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>tively “incorporate[s]” common-law trust duties into §162a(d), ante, at&para;<br>22, that language simply makes clear that §162a(d) does not set forth&para;<br>an exhaustive list of the Government’s trust responsibilities in manag&para;<br>ing Indian trust funds; nothing in that language itself imports any&para;<br>substantive obligations into the statute.&para;<br>10 The majority also contends that its reading of §162a(d) is supported&para;<br>by a provision in the Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982 (ICLA), 96&para;<br>Stat. 1976, which provided that if the Secretary of the Interior rejected&para;<br>a claim for litigation by an Indian claimant, he was required to provide&para;<br>upon request “any nonprivileged research materials or evidence gath&para;<br>ered by the United States in the documentation of such claim.” §5(b),&para;<br>id., at 1978. According to the majority, this provision reflected Con&para;<br>gress’ understanding that “the Government retains evidentiary privi&para;<br>leges allowing it to withhold information related to trust property from&para;<br>Indian tribes.” Ante, at 22, n. 11. But this provision cannot bear the&para;<br>weight the majority places on it. Even putting aside the undisputed&para;<br>fact that the ICLA is inapplicable to the claims in this case, the major&para;<br>ity’s reliance on the ICLA provision fails to recognize that documents&para;<br>subject to the fiduciary exception are, under the “real client” rationale,&para;<br>per se nonprivileged. See, e.g., Mett, 178 F. 3d, at 1063. Accordingly, if&para;<br>anything, the ICLA’s requirement that the Government disclose “non&para;<br>privileged” materials to Indian claimants supports the conclusion that&para;<br>Congress intended communications related to trust fund management&para;<br>to be disclosed to Indian tribes.&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Nation access to those communications. The upshot of&para;<br>that decision, I fear, may very well be to reinvigorate the&para;<br>position of the dissenting Justices in White Mountain&para;<br>Apache and Mitchell II, who rejected the use of common&para;<br>law principles to inform the scope of the Government’s&para;<br>fiduciary obligations to Indian tribes. See White Mountain&para;<br>Apache, 537 U. S., at 486–487 (THOMAS, J., dissenting);&para;<br>Mitchell II, 463 U. S., at 234–235 (Powell, J., dissenting).&para;<br>That approach was wrong when Mitchell II was decided&para;<br>nearly 30 years ago, and it is wrong today. Under our&para;<br>governing precedents, common-law trust principles play&para;<br>an important role in defining the Government’s fiduciary&para;<br>duties where, as here, the statutory scheme establishes a&para;<br>conventional fiduciary relationship. Applying those prin&para;<br>ciples in this context, I would hold that the fiduciary ex&para;<br>ception is fully applicable to the communications in this&para;<br>case.11&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 The majority’s errors are further compounded by its failure to ac&para;<br>cord proper consideration to the mandamus posture of this case. “This&para;<br>Court repeatedly has observed that the writ of mandamus is an ex&para;<br>traordinary remedy, to be reserved for extraordinary situations.”&para;<br>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U.

The&para;<br>sad and well-documented truth, however, is that the Gov&para;<br>ernment has failed to live up to its fiduciary obligations in&para;<br>managing Indian trust fund accounts. See, e.g., Cobell,&para;<br>240 F. 3d, at 1089 (“The General Accounting Office, Inte&para;<br>rior Department Inspector General, and Office of Man&para;<br>agement and Budget, among others, have all condemned&para;<br>the mismanagement of [Indian] trust accounts over the&para;<br>past twenty years”); Misplaced Trust 8 (“[T]he [Govern&para;<br>ment’s] indifferent supervision and control of the Indian&para;<br>trust funds has consistently resulted in a failure to exer&para;<br>cise its responsibility and [to meet] any reasonable expec&para;<br>tations of the tribal and individual accountholders, Con&para;<br>gress, and taxpayers”); id., at 56 (“[H]ad this type of&para;<br>mismanagement taken place in any other trust arrange&para;<br>ments such as Social Security, there would be war”).&para;<br>As Congress has recognized, “[t]he Indian trust fund is&para;<br>more than balance sheets and accounting procedures.&para;<br>These moneys are crucial to the daily operations of native&para;<br>American tribes and a source of income to tens of thou&para;<br>sands of native Americans.” Id., at 5. Given the history of&para;<br>governmental mismanagement of Indian trust funds,&para;<br>application of the fiduciary exception is, if anything, even&para;<br>more important in this context than in the private trustee&para;<br>——————&para;<br>here. Ante, at 24, and n. 13. By doing so, the majority virtually assures&para;<br>that the Nation will not be able to use the communications at issue in&para;<br>this litigation, thereby effectively granting extraordinary relief to the&para;<br>Government upon no showing whatsoever that the stringent conditions&para;<br>for mandamus have been met.&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. JICARILLA APACHE NATION&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>context. The majority’s refusal to apply the fiduciary&para;<br>exception in this case deprives the Nation—as well as the&para;<br>Indian tribes in the more than 90 cases currently pending&para;<br>in the federal courts involving claims of tribal trust mis&para;<br>management, App. to Pet. for Cert. 126a–138a—of highly&para;<br>relevant information going directly to the merits of&para;<br>whether the Government properly fulfilled its fiduciary&para;<br>duties. Its holding only further exacerbates the concerns&para;<br>expressed by many about the lack of adequate oversight&para;<br>and accountability that has marked the Government’s&para;<br>handling of Indian trust fund accounts for decades.&para;<br>But perhaps even more troubling than the majority’s&para;<br>refusal to apply the fiduciary exception in this case is its&para;<br>disregard of our established precedents that affirm the&para;<br>central role that common-law trust principles play in&para;<br>defining the Government’s fiduciary obligations to Indian&para;<br>tribes. By rejecting the Nation’s claim on the ground that&para;<br>it fails to identify a specific statutory right to the commu&para;<br>nications at issue, the majority effectively embraces an&para;<br>approach espoused by prior dissents that rejects the role of&para;<br>common-law principles altogether in the Indian trust&para;<br>context. Its decision to do so in a case involving only a&para;<br>narrow evidentiary issue is wholly unnecessary and, worse&para;<br>yet, risks further diluting the Government’s fiduciary&para;<br>obligations in a manner that Congress clearly did not&para;<br>intend and that would inflict serious harm on the already&para;<br>frayed relationship between the United States and Indian&para;<br>tribes. Because there is no warrant in precedent or reason&para;<br>for reaching that result, I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
