Argued January 14, 2014—Decided March 10, 2014&para;<br>Congress passed the General Railroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875 to provide railroad companies “right[s] of way through the public lands of&para;<br>the United States,” 43 U. S. C. §934. One such right of way, obtained&para;<br>by a railroad in 1908, crosses land that the United States conveyed to&para;<br>the Brandt family in a 1976 land patent. That patent stated, as relevant here, that the land was granted subject to the railroad’s rights&para;<br>in the 1875 Act right of way, but it did not specify what would occur if&para;<br>the railroad later relinquished those rights. Years later, a successor&para;<br>railroad abandoned the right of way with federal approval. The Government then sought a judicial declaration of abandonment and an&para;<br>order quieting title in the United States to the abandoned right of&para;<br>way, including the stretch that crossed the land conveyed in the&para;<br>Brandt patent. Petitioners contested the claim, asserting that the&para;<br>right of way was a mere easement that was extinguished when the&para;<br>railroad abandoned it, so that Brandt now enjoys full title to his land&para;<br>without the burden of the easement. The Government countered that&para;<br>the 1875 Act granted the railroad something more than a mere easement, and that the United States retained a reversionary interest in&para;<br>that land once the railroad abandoned it. The District Court granted&para;<br>summary judgment to the Government and quieted title in the United States to the right of way. The Tenth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: The right of way was an easement that was terminated by the&para;<br>railroad’s abandonment, leaving Brandt’s land unburdened. Pp. 8–&para;<br>17.&para;<br>(a) The Government loses this case in large part because it won&para;<br>when it argued the opposite in Great Northern R. Co. v. United&para;<br>States, 315 U. S. 262. There, the Government contended that the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MARVIN M. BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST v.&para;<br>UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>1875 Act (unlike pre-1871 statutes granting rights of way) granted&para;<br>nothing more than an easement, and that the railroad in that case&para;<br>therefore had no interest in the resources beneath the surface of its&para;<br>right of way. This Court adopted the Government’s position in full.&para;<br>It found the 1875 Act’s text “wholly inconsistent” with the grant of a&para;<br>fee interest, id., at 271; agreed with the Government that cases describing the nature of rights of way granted prior to 1871 were “not&para;<br>controlling” because of a major shift in congressional policy concerning land grants to railroads after that year, id., at 278; and held that&para;<br>the 1875 Act “clearly grants only an easement,” id., at 271. Under&para;<br>well-established common law property principles, an easement disappears when abandoned by its beneficiary, leaving the owner of the&para;<br>underlying land to resume a full and unencumbered interest in the&para;<br>land. See Smith v. Townsend, 148 U. S. 490, 499. Pp. 8–12.&para;<br>(b) The Government asks this Court to limit Great Northern’s characterization of 1875 Act rights of way as easements to the question of&para;<br>who owns the oil and minerals beneath a right of way. But nothing&para;<br>in the 1875 Act’s text supports that reading, and the Government’s&para;<br>reliance on the similarity of the language in the 1875 Act and pre1871 statutes directly contravenes the very premise of Great Northern: that the 1875 Act granted a fundamentally different interest&para;<br>than did its predecessor statutes. Nor do this Court’s decisions in&para;<br>Stalker v. Oregon Short Line R. Co., 225 U. S. 142, and Great Northern R. Co. v. Steinke, 261 U. S. 119, support the Government’s position. The dispute in each of those cases was framed in terms of competing claims to acquire and develop a particular tract of land, and it&para;<br>does not appear that the Court considered—much less rejected—an&para;<br>argument that the railroad had only an easement in the contested&para;<br>land. But to the extent that those cases could be read to imply that&para;<br>the interest was something more, any such implication would not&para;<br>have survived this Court’s unequivocal statement to the contrary in&para;<br>Great Northern. Finally, later enacted statutes, see 43 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§912, 940; 16 U. S. C. §1248(c), do not define or shed light on the nature of the interest Congress granted to railroads in their rights of&para;<br>way in 1875. They instead purport only to dispose of interests (if&para;<br>any) the United States already possesses. Pp. 12–17.&para;<br>496 Fed. Appx. 822, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

New technol­&para;<br>ogy provided the answer: the railroad. The Civil War&para;<br>spurred the effort to develop a transcontinental railroad,&para;<br>as the Federal Government saw the need to protect its&para;<br>citizens and secure its possessions in the West. Leo Sheep&para;<br>Co. v. United States, 440 U. S. 668, 674–676 (1979). The&para;<br>construction of such a railroad would “furnish a cheap and&para;<br>expeditious mode for the transportation of troops and&para;<br>supplies,” help develop “the agricultural and mineral&para;<br>resources of this territory,” and foster settlement. United&para;<br>States v. Union Pacific R. Co., 91 U. S. 72, 80 (1875).&para;<br>The substantial benefits a transcontinental railroad&para;<br>could bring were clear, but building it was no simple&para;<br>matter. The risks were great and the costs were stagger­&para;<br>ing. Popular sentiment grew for the Government to play a&para;<br>role in supporting the massive project. Indeed, in 1860,&para;<br>President Lincoln’s winning platform proclaimed: “That a&para;<br>railroad to the Pacific Ocean is imperatively demanded by&para;<br>the interests of the whole country; that the Federal Gov­&para;<br>ernment ought to render immediate and efficient aid in its&para;<br>construction.” J. Ely, Railroads and American Law 51&para;<br>(2001). But how to do it? Sufficient funds were not at&para;<br>hand (especially with a Civil War to fight), and there were&para;<br>serious reservations about the legal authority for direct&para;<br>financing. “The policy of the country, to say nothing of the&para;<br>supposed want of constitutional power, stood in the way of&para;<br>the United States taking the work into its own hands.”&para;<br>Union Pacific R. Co., supra, at 81.&para;<br>What the country did have, however, was land—lots of&para;<br>it. It could give away vast swaths of public land—which at&para;<br>the time possessed little value without reliable transporta­&para;<br>tion—in hopes that such grants would increase the appeal&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

In the early 1860s, Congress began&para;<br>granting to railroad companies rights of way through the&para;<br>public domain, accompanied by outright grants of land&para;<br>along those rights of way. P. Gates, History of Public Land&para;<br>Law Development 362–368 (1968). The land was conveyed in checkerboard blocks. For example, under the&para;<br>Union Pacific Act of 1862, odd-numbered lots of one square&para;<br>mile apiece were granted to the railroad, while even­&para;<br>numbered lots were retained by the United States. Leo&para;<br>Sheep Co., supra, at 672–673, 686, n. 23. Railroads could&para;<br>then either develop their lots or sell them, to finance&para;<br>construction of rail lines and encourage the settlement of&para;<br>future customers. Indeed, railroads became the largest&para;<br>secondary dispenser of public lands, after the States.&para;<br>Gates, supra, at 379.&para;<br>But public resentment against such generous land&para;<br>grants to railroads began to grow in the late 1860s. West­&para;<br>ern settlers, initially some of the staunchest supporters of&para;<br>governmental railroad subsidization, complained that the&para;<br>railroads moved too slowly in placing their lands on the&para;<br>market and into the hands of farmers and settlers. Citi­&para;<br>zens and Members of Congress argued that the grants&para;<br>conflicted with the goal of the Homestead Act of 1862 to&para;<br>encourage individual citizens to settle and develop the&para;<br>frontier lands. By the 1870s, legislators across the politi­&para;<br>cal spectrum had embraced a policy of reserving public&para;<br>lands for settlers rather than granting them to railroads.&para;<br>Id., at 380, 454–456.&para;<br>A House resolution adopted in 1872 summed up the&para;<br>change in national policy, stating:&para;<br>“That in the judgment of this House the policy of&para;<br>granting subsidies in public lands to railroads and&para;<br>other corporations ought to be discontinued, and that&para;<br>every consideration of public policy and equal justice&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MARVIN M.

Globe, 42d Cong., 2d&para;<br>Sess., 1585.&para;<br>Congress enacted the last checkerboard land-grant statute&para;<br>for railroads in 1871. Gates, supra, at 380. Still wishing&para;<br>to encourage railroad construction, however, Congress&para;<br>passed at least 15 special acts between 1871 and 1875&para;<br>granting to designated railroads “the right of way”&para;<br>through public lands, without any accompanying land&para;<br>subsidy. Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, 315 U. S.&para;<br>262, 274, and n. 9 (1942).&para;<br>Rather than continue to enact special legislation for&para;<br>each such right of way, Congress passed the General&para;<br>Railroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 482, 43&para;<br>U. S. C. §§934–939. The 1875 Act provided that “[t]he&para;<br>right of way through the public lands of the United States&para;<br>is granted to any railroad company” meeting certain re­&para;<br>quirements, “to the extent of one hundred feet on each side&para;<br>of the central line of said road.” §934. A railroad company&para;<br>could obtain a right of way by the “actual construction of&para;<br>its road” or “in advance of construction by filing a map as&para;<br>provided in section four” of the Act. Jamestown &amp; Northern R. Co. v. Jones, 177 U. S. 125, 130–131 (1900). Section&para;<br>4 in turn provided that a company could “secure” its right&para;<br>of way by filing a proposed map of its rail corridor with a&para;<br>local Department of the Interior office within 12 months&para;<br>after survey or location of the road. §937. Upon approval&para;<br>by the Interior Department, the right of way would be&para;<br>noted on the land plats held at the local office, and from&para;<br>that day forward “all such lands over which such right of&para;<br>way shall pass shall be disposed of subject to the right&para;<br>of way.” Ibid.&para;<br>The 1875 Act remained in effect until 1976, when its&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Brandt began working at a sawmill in Fox&para;<br>Park, Wyoming, in 1939. He later purchased the sawmill&para;<br>and, in 1946, moved his family to Fox Park. Melvin’s son&para;<br>Marvin started working at the sawmill in 1958 and came&para;<br>to own and operate it in 1976 until it closed, 15 years&para;<br>later.&para;<br>In 1976, the United States patented an 83-acre parcel of&para;<br>land in Fox Park, surrounded by the Medicine Bow-Routt&para;<br>National Forest, to Melvin and Lulu Brandt. (A land&para;<br>patent is an official document reflecting a grant by a&para;<br>sovereign that is made public, or “patent.”) The patent&para;<br>conveyed to the Brandts fee simple title to the land “with&para;<br>all the rights, privileges, immunities, and appurtenances,&para;<br>of whatsoever nature, thereunto belonging, unto said&para;<br>claimants, their successors and assigns, forever.” App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 76. But the patent did include limited excep­&para;<br>tions and reservations. For example, the patent “except[s]&para;<br>and reserv[es] to the United States from the land granted&para;<br>a right-of-way thereon for ditches or canals constructed&para;<br>by the authority of the United States”; “reserv[es] to the&para;<br>United States . . . a right-of-way for the existing Platte&para;<br>Access Road No. 512”; and “reserv[es] to the United States&para;<br>. . . a right-of-way for the existing Dry Park Road No. 517.”&para;<br>Id., at 76–77 (capitalization omitted). But if those roads&para;<br>cease to be used by the United States or its assigns for a&para;<br>period of five years, the patent provides that “the ease­&para;<br>ment traversed thereby shall terminate.” Id., at 78.&para;<br>Most relevant to this case, the patent concludes by&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MARVIN M.

Nearly a half-mile stretch of the right of way&para;<br>crosses Brandt’s land in Fox Park, covering ten acres of&para;<br>that parcel.&para;<br>In 1911, the LHP&amp;P completed construction of its rail­&para;<br>way over the right of way, from Laramie to Coalmont,&para;<br>Colorado.

Brandt contends that the right of way&para;<br>granted under the 1875 Act was an easement, so that&para;<br>when the railroad abandoned it, the underlying land&para;<br>(Brandt’s Fox Park parcel) simply became unburdened of&para;<br>the easement. The Government does not dispute that&para;<br>easements normally work this way, but maintains that the&para;<br>1875 Act granted the railroads something more than an&para;<br>easement, reserving an implied reversionary interest in&para;<br>that something more to the United States. The Govern­&para;<br>ment loses that argument today, in large part because it&para;<br>won when it argued the opposite before this Court more&para;<br>than 70 years ago, in the case of Great Northern Railway&para;<br>Co. v.

Great Northern relied on those cases to contend&para;<br>that it owned a “fee” interest in the right of way, which&para;<br>included the right to drill for minerals beneath the&para;<br>surface.&para;<br>The Government disagreed. It argued that “the 1875&para;<br>Act granted an easement and nothing more,” and that the&para;<br>railroad accordingly could claim no interest in the re­&para;<br>sources beneath the surface.

Calling this language “wholly&para;<br>inconsistent” with the grant of a fee interest, the Court&para;<br>endorsed the lower court’s statement that “[a]pter words&para;<br>to indicate the intent to convey an easement would be&para;<br>difficult to find.” Ibid.&para;<br>That interpretation was confirmed, the Court explained,&para;<br>by the historical background against which the 1875 Act&para;<br>was passed and by subsequent administrative and con­&para;<br>gressional interpretation. The Court accepted the Gov­&para;<br>ernment’s position that prior cases describing the nature&para;<br>of pre-1871 rights of way—including Townsend, supra, at&para;<br>271—were “not controlling,” because of the shift in con­&para;<br>gressional policy after that year. Great Northern, supra,&para;<br>at 277–278, and n. 18. The Court also specifically disa­&para;<br>vowed the characterization of an 1875 Act right of way in&para;<br>Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Stringham, 239 U. S. 44&para;<br>(1915), as “ ‘a limited fee, made on an implied condition of&para;<br>reverter.’ ” Great Northern, supra, at 278–279 (quoting&para;<br>Stringham, supra, at 47). The Court noted that in Stringham “it does not appear that Congress’ change of policy&para;<br>after 1871 was brought to the Court’s attention,” given&para;<br>that “[n]o brief was filed by the defendant or the United&para;<br>States” in that case. Great Northern, supra, at 279, and&para;<br>n. 20.&para;<br>The dissent is wrong to conclude that Great Northern&para;<br>merely held that “the right of way did not confer one&para;<br>particular attribute of fee title.” Post, at 3 (opinion&para;<br>of SOTOMAYOR, J.). To the contrary, the Court specifically&para;<br>rejected the notion that the right of way conferred even a&para;<br>“limited fee.” 315 U. S., at 279; see also id., at 277–278&para;<br>(declining to follow cases describing a right of way as a&para;<br>“limited,” “base,” or “qualified” fee).

The United States&para;<br>did not reserve to itself any interest in the right of way in&para;<br>that patent. Under Great Northern, the railroad thus had&para;<br>an easement in its right of way over land owned by the&para;<br>Brandts.&para;<br>The essential features of easements—including, most&para;<br>important here, what happens when they cease to be&para;<br>used—are well settled as a matter of property law. An&para;<br>easement is a “nonpossessory right to enter and use land&para;<br>in the possession of another and obligates the possessor&para;<br>not to interfere with the uses authorized by the easement.”&para;<br>Restatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes §1.2(1)&para;<br>(1998). “Unlike most possessory estates, easements . . .&para;<br>may be unilaterally terminated by abandonment, leaving&para;<br>the servient owner with a possessory estate unencum­&para;<br>bered by the servitude.” Id., §1.2, Comment d; id., §7.4,&para;<br>Comments a, f. In other words, if the beneficiary of the&para;<br>easement abandons it, the easement disappears, and the&para;<br>landowner resumes his full and unencumbered interest in&para;<br>the land. See Smith v. Townsend, 148 U.

It arises&para;<br>when the grantor “transfers less than his entire interest” in a piece of&para;<br>land, and it is either certain or possible that he will retake the trans­&para;<br>ferred interest at a future date. Id., Comment a. Because the grantor&para;<br>of an easement has not transferred his estate or possessory interest, he&para;<br>has not retained a reversionary interest. He retains all his ownership&para;<br>interest, subject to an easement. See Preseault v. United States, 100&para;<br>F. 3d 1525, 1533–1534 (CA Fed. 1996) (en banc).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Even if the right of&para;<br>way has some features of an easement—such as granting&para;<br>only a surface interest to the railroad when the Govern­&para;<br>ment wants the subsurface oil and minerals—the Gov­&para;<br>ernment asks us to hold that the right of way is not an&para;<br>easement for purposes of what happens when the railroad&para;<br>stops using it. But nothing in the text of the 1875 Act&para;<br>supports such an improbable (and self-serving) reading.&para;<br>The Government argues that the similarity in the lan­&para;<br>guage of the 1875 Act and the pre-1871 statutes shows&para;<br>that Congress intended to reserve a reversionary interest&para;<br>in the lands granted under the 1875 Act, just as it did in&para;<br>the pre-1871 statutes. See Brief for United States 17–18.&para;<br>But that is directly contrary to the very premise of this&para;<br>Court’s decision (and the Government’s argument) in&para;<br>Great Northern: that the 1875 Act granted a fundamentally different interest in the rights of way than did the&para;<br>predecessor statutes. 315 U.

S.&para;<br>Great Northern Brief 30 (“[Great Northern’s] argument . . .&para;<br>fails because it disregards the essential differences be­&para;<br>tween the 1875 Act and its predecessors.”). Contrary to&para;<br>the Government’s position now—but consistent with the&para;<br>Government’s position in 1942—Great Northern stands for&para;<br>the proposition that the pre-1871 statutes (and this&para;<br>Court’s decisions construing them) have little relevance to&para;<br>the question of what interest the 1875 Act conveyed to&para;<br>railroads.&para;<br>The Government next contends that this Court’s deci­&para;<br>sions in Stalker v.

If the right of way were a mere easement,&para;<br>the argument goes, the patent would have passed title to&para;<br>the underlying land subject to the railroad’s right of way,&para;<br>rather than failing to pass title altogether. But that is a&para;<br>substantial overreading of those cases.&para;<br>In both Stalker and Steinke, a railroad that had already&para;<br>obtained an 1875 Act right of way thereafter claimed&para;<br>adjacent land for station grounds under the Act, as it was&para;<br>permitted to do because of its right of way. A homesteader&para;<br>subsequently filed a claim to the same land, unaware of&para;<br>the station grounds. The question in each case was&para;<br>whether the railroad could build on the station grounds,&para;<br>notwithstanding a subsequent patent to the homesteader.&para;<br>The homesteader claimed priority because the railroad’s&para;<br>station grounds map had not been recorded in the local&para;<br>land office at the time the homesteader filed his claim.&para;<br>This Court construed the 1875 Act to give the railroad&para;<br>priority because it had submitted its proposed map to the&para;<br>Department of the Interior before the homesteader filed&para;<br>his claim. See Stalker, supra, at 148–154; Steinke, supra,&para;<br>at 125–129.&para;<br>The dispute in each case was framed in terms of compet­&para;<br>ing claims to the right to acquire and develop the same&para;<br>tract of land. The Court ruled for the railroad, but did not&para;<br>purport to define the precise nature of the interest granted&para;<br>under the 1875 Act. Indeed, it does not appear that the&para;<br>Court in either case considered—much less rejected—an&para;<br>argument that the railroad had obtained only an easement&para;<br>in the contested land, so that the patent could still convey&para;<br>title to the homesteader.

S., at 271.&para;<br>Finally, the Government relies on a number of later&para;<br>enacted statutes that it says demonstrate that Congress&para;<br>believed the United States had retained a reversionary&para;<br>interest in the 1875 Act rights of way. Brief for United&para;<br>States 34–42. But each of those statutes purported only to&para;<br>dispose of interests the United States already possessed,&para;<br>not to create or modify any such interests in the first&para;<br>place. First, in 1906 and 1909, Congress declared forfeited&para;<br>any right of way on which a railroad had not been con­&para;<br>structed in the five years after the location of the road. 43&para;<br>U. S. C. §940. The United States would “resume[ ] the full&para;<br>title to the lands covered thereby free and discharged of&para;<br>such easement,” but the forfeited right of way would im­&para;<br>mediately “inure to the benefit of any owner or owners of&para;<br>land conveyed by the United States prior to such date.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>Then, in 1922, Congress provided that whenever a&para;<br>railroad forfeited or officially abandoned its right of way,&para;<br>“all right, title, interest, and estate of the United States&para;<br>in said lands” (other than land that had been converted&para;<br>to a public highway) would immediately be transferred to&para;<br>either the municipality in which it was located, or else to&para;<br>the person who owned the underlying land. 43 U. S. C.&para;<br>§912. Finally, as part of the National Trails System Im­&para;<br>provements Act of 1988, Congress changed course and&para;<br>sought to retain title to abandoned or forfeited railroad&para;<br>rights of way, specifying that “any and all right, title,&para;<br>interest, and estate of the United States” in such rights of&para;<br>way “shall remain in the United States” upon abandon­&para;<br>ment or forfeiture. 16 U.

That is wrong.&para;<br>This case turns on what kind of interest Congress granted&para;<br>to railroads in their rights of way in 1875. Cf. Leo Sheep&para;<br>Co., 440 U. S., at 681 (“The pertinent inquiry in this case&para;<br>is the intent of Congress when it granted land to the Un­&para;<br>ion Pacific in 1862.”). Great Northern answered that&para;<br>question: an easement. The statutes the Government cites&para;<br>do not purport to define (or redefine) the nature of the&para;<br>interest conveyed under the 1875 Act. Nor do they shed&para;<br>light on what kind of property interest Congress intended&para;<br>to convey to railroads in 1875. See United States v. Price,&para;<br>361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960) (“the views of a subsequent&para;<br>Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of&para;<br>an earlier one”).&para;<br>In other words, these statutes do not tell us whether the&para;<br>United States has an interest in any particular right of&para;<br>way; they simply tell us how any interest the United&para;<br>States might have should be disposed of. For pre-1871&para;<br>rights of way in which the United States retained an&para;<br>implied reversionary interest, or for rights of way crossing&para;<br>public lands, these statutes might make a difference in&para;<br>what happens to a forfeited or abandoned right of way.&para;<br>But if there is no “right, title, interest, [or] estate of the&para;<br>United States” in the right of way, 43 U.

Second, the Court relies on&para;<br>“basic common law principles,” ante, at 12, without recognizing that courts have long treated railroad rights of way&para;<br>as sui generis property rights not governed by the ordinary&para;<br>common-law regime.

BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST v.&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>Over a century ago, this Court held that a right of way&para;<br>granted to a railroad by a pre-1871 Act of Congress included “an implied condition of reverter” to the Government if the right of way ceased to be used “for the purpose&para;<br>for which it was granted.” Northern Pacific R. Co. v.&para;<br>Townsend, 190 U. S. 267, 271 (1903). The question in&para;<br>Townsend was whether individual homesteaders could&para;<br>acquire title by adverse possession to land granted by the&para;<br>United States as a railroad right of way. The Court held&para;<br>that they could not, because “the land forming the right of&para;<br>way was not granted with the intent that it might be&para;<br>absolutely disposed of at the volition of the company.”&para;<br>Ibid. “On the contrary,” the Court held, “the grant was&para;<br>explicitly stated to be for a designated purpose, one which&para;<br>negated the existence of the power to voluntarily alienate&para;<br>the right of way or any portion thereof.” Ibid. Hence the&para;<br>“implied condition of reverter in the event that the company ceased to use or retain the land for the purpose for&para;<br>which it was granted.” Ibid. In essence, the Court held,&para;<br>“the grant was of a limited fee,” ibid.—commonly known&para;<br>as a defeasible fee, see Restatement (First) of Property §16&para;<br>(1936)—rather than fee simple. Thus, if the railroad were&para;<br>to abandon its use of the right of way, the property would&para;<br>revert to the United States.&para;<br>The Court later confirmed in Rio Grande Western R. Co.&para;<br>v. Stringham, 239 U. S. 44, 47 (1915), that this rule applies not just to pre-1871 land grants to railroads, but also&para;<br>to rights of way granted under the General Railroad&para;<br>Right-of-Way Act—the Act under which the United States&para;<br>granted the right of way at issue in this case. That case&para;<br>stated that rights of way granted under the 1875 Act are&para;<br>“made on an implied condition of reverter in the event that&para;<br>the company ceases to use or retain the land for the purposes for which it is granted.” Ibid. Indeed, Stringham&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

If Townsend and Stringham&para;<br>remain good law on that point, then this case should be&para;<br>resolved in the Government’s favor.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>This case therefore turns on whether, as the majority&para;<br>asserts, Great Northern “disavowed” Townsend and&para;<br>Stringham as to the question whether the United States&para;<br>retained a reversionary interest in the right of way. Ante,&para;<br>at 10. Great Northern did no such thing. Nor could it&para;<br>have, for the Court did not have occasion to consider that&para;<br>question.&para;<br>In Great Northern, a railroad sought to drill for oil&para;<br>beneath the surface of a right of way granted under the&para;<br>1875 Act. We held that the railroad had no right to drill,&para;<br>because the United States did not convey the underlying&para;<br>oil and minerals when it granted the railroad a right of&para;<br>way. In language on which the Court relies heavily, Great&para;<br>Northern opined that the 1875 Act granted the railroad&para;<br>“only an easement, and not a fee.” 315 U. S., at 271.&para;<br>But that language does not logically lead to the place at&para;<br>which the majority ultimately arrives. All that Great&para;<br>Northern held—all, at least, that was necessary to its&para;<br>ruling—was that the right of way did not confer one particular attribute of fee title. Specifically, the Court held,&para;<br>the right of way did not confer the right to exploit subterranean resources, because the 1875 Act could not have&para;<br>made clearer that the right of way extended only to surface lands: It provided that after the recordation of a right&para;<br>of way, “all . . . lands over which such right of way shall&para;<br>pass shall be disposed of subject to such right of way.”&para;<br>Ibid.

Cf. B. Cardozo,&para;<br>The Paradoxes of Legal Science 129 (1928) (reprint 2000);&para;<br>United States v. Craft, 535 U. S. 274, 278 (2002). And this&para;<br>case concerns an attribute of fee title—defeasibility—that&para;<br>no party contends was at issue in Great Northern.&para;<br>The majority places heavy emphasis on Great Northern’s&para;<br>characterization of rights of way under the 1875 Act as&para;<br>“easements,” rather than “limited fees.” When an easement is abandoned, the majority reasons, it is extinguished; in effect, it reverts to the owner of the underlying&para;<br>estate, rather than to its original grantor. Ante, at 11–12.&para;<br>For that reason, the majority concludes, “basic common&para;<br>law principles” require us to retreat from our prior holdings that railroad rights of way entail an implied possibility of reverter to the original grantor—the United States—&para;<br>should the right of way cease to be used by a railroad for&para;<br>its intended purpose. Ante, at 12.&para;<br>But federal and state decisions in this area have not&para;<br>historically depended on “basic common law principles.”&para;<br>To the contrary, this Court and others have long recognized that in the context of railroad rights of way, traditional property terms like “fee” and “easement” do not&para;<br>neatly track common-law definitions. In Stringham, the&para;<br>Court articulated ways in which rights of ways bear attributes both of easements and fees, explaining that “[t]he&para;<br>right of way granted by [the 1875 Act] and similar acts is&para;<br>neither a mere easement, nor a fee simple absolute.” 239&para;<br>U. S., at 47. In New Mexico v. United States Trust Co.,&para;<br>172 U. S. 171, 182–183 (1898), the Court further observed&para;<br>that even if a particular right of way granted by the United&para;<br>States was an “easement,” then it was “surely more&para;<br>than an ordinary easement” because it had “attributes of&para;<br>the fee” like exclusive use and possession. See also Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 195 U. S.&para;<br>540, 569–570 (1904) (reaffirming this view). Earlier, in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>1854, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court had&para;<br>explained that although the right acquired by a railroad&para;<br>was “technically an easement,” it “require[d] for its enjoyment a use of the land permanent in its nature and practically exclusive.” Hazen v. Boston and Me. R. Co., 68 Mass.&para;<br>574, 580 (1854). And the Iowa Supreme Court, in a late&para;<br>19th-century opinion, observed that “[t]he easement” in&para;<br>question “is not that spoken of in the old law books, but is&para;<br>peculiar to the use of a railroad.” Smith v. Hall, 103 Iowa&para;<br>95, 96, 72 N. W. 427, 428 (1897).&para;<br>Today’s opinion dispenses with these teachings. Although the majority canvasses the special role railroads&para;<br>played in the development of our Nation, it concludes that&para;<br>we are bound by the common-law definitions that apply to&para;<br>more typical property. In doing so, it ignores the sui&para;<br>generis nature of railroad rights of way. That Great&para;<br>Northern referred to a right of way granted under the&para;<br>1875 Act as an “easement” does not derail the Court’s&para;<br>previous unequivocal pronouncements that rights of way&para;<br>under the Act are “made on an implied condition of reverter.” Stringham, 239 U. S., at 47.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Not only does Great Northern fail to support the majority’s conclusion; significant aspects of Great Northern’s&para;<br>reasoning actually support the contrary view. In that&para;<br>case, the Court relied heavily on Congress’ policy shift in&para;<br>the early 1870’s away from bestowing extravagant “ ‘subsidies in public lands to railroads and other corporations.’ ”&para;<br>315 U. S., at 273–274 (quoting Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 2d&para;<br>Sess., 1585 (1872)). That history similarly weighs in the&para;<br>Government’s favor here. Just as the post-1871 Congress&para;<br>did not likely mean to confer subsurface mineral rights on&para;<br>railroads, as held in Great Northern, it did not likely mean&para;<br>to grant railroads an indefeasible property interest in&para;<br>rights of way—a kind of interest more generous than that&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MARVIN M. BRANDT REVOCABLE TRUST v.&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>which it gave in our cases concerning pre-1871 grants.&para;<br>As in Great Northern, moreover, the purpose of the 1875&para;<br>Act supports the Government. Congress passed the Act,&para;<br>we noted, “to permit the construction of railroads through&para;<br>public lands” and thus to “enhance their value and hasten&para;<br>their settlement.” 315 U. S., at 272. In Great Northern,&para;<br>we held, that purpose did not require granting to the&para;<br>railroad any right to that which lay beneath the surface.&para;<br>The same is true here. As we recognized in Townsend and&para;<br>Stringham, the United States granted rights of way to&para;<br>railroads subject to “an implied condition of reverter in the&para;<br>event that the” railroads “cease[d] to use or retain the land&para;<br>for the purposes for which it is granted.” Stringham, 239&para;<br>U. S., at 47. Nothing about the purpose of the 1875 Act&para;<br>suggests Congress ever meant to abandon that sensible&para;<br>limitation.&para;<br>Further, Great Northern relied on the conventional rule&para;<br>that “a grant is to be resolved favorably to a sovereign&para;<br>grantor,” 315 U. S., at 272, and that “ ‘nothing passes but&para;<br>what is conveyed in clear and explicit language,’ ” ibid.&para;<br>(quoting Caldwell v. United States, 250 U. S. 14, 20&para;<br>(1919)). “Nothing in the [1875] Act,” we observed, “may be&para;<br>characterized as a ‘clear and explicit’ conveyance of the . . .&para;<br>oil and minerals” underlying a right of way. 315 U. S.,&para;<br>at 272. Just so here, as nothing in the 1875 Act clearly&para;<br>evinces Congress’ intent not to make the rights of way&para;<br>conveyed under the Act defeasible, in the manner described by Townsend and Stringham. In fact, the presumption in favor of sovereign grantors applies doubly&para;<br>here, where the United States was the sovereign grantor&para;<br>both of the right of way and of the ultimate patent.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The majority notes that in Great Northern, the United&para;<br>States took the position that rights of way granted to&para;<br>railroads are easements. Ante, at 9. In the majority’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>view, because the Great Northern Court adopted that&para;<br>position “in full,” it is unfair for the Government to backtrack on that position now. Ante, at 9.&para;<br>Even assuming that it is an injustice for the Government to change positions on an issue over a 70-year period,&para;<br>it is not clear that such a change in position happened&para;<br>here. Yes, the Government argued in Great Northern that&para;<br>a right of way was an “easement.” It proposed, however,&para;<br>that the right of way may well have had “some of the&para;<br>attributes of a fee.” Brief for United States in Great&para;<br>Northern R. Co. v. United States, O. T. 1941, No. 149,&para;<br>pp. 36–37. The Government contended that it is “ ‘not&para;<br>important whether the interest or estate passed be considered an easement or a limited fee,’ ” observing that an&para;<br>easement “may be held in fee determinable.” Id., at 35–36&para;<br>(quoting United States v. Big Horn Land &amp; Cattle Co., 17&para;<br>F. 2d 357, 365 (CA8 1927)). Indeed, the Government&para;<br>expressly reserved the possibility that it retained a reversionary interest in the right of way, even if the surrounding land was patented to others. Brief for United States in&para;<br>Great Northern, at 10 n. 4. The Court is right to criticize&para;<br>the Government when it takes “self-serving” and contradictory positions, ante, at 12, but such critique is misplaced here.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Since 1903, this Court has held that rights of way were&para;<br>granted to railroads with an implied possibility of reverter&para;<br>to the United States. Regardless of whether these rights&para;<br>of way are labeled “easements” or “fees,” nothing in Great&para;<br>Northern overruled that conclusion. By changing course&para;<br>today, the Court undermines the legality of thousands of&para;<br>miles of former rights of way that the public now enjoys as&para;<br>means of transportation and recreation.
