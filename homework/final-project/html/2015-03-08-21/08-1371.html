MARTINEZ ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1371. Argued April 19, 2010—Decided June 28, 2010&para;<br>Respondent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings), a school within the&para;<br>University of California public-school system, extends official recog&para;<br>nition to student groups through its “Registered Student Organiza&para;<br>tion” (RSO) program. Several benefits attend this school-approved&para;<br>status, including the use of school funds, facilities, and channels of&para;<br>communication, as well as Hastings’ name and logo. In exchange for&para;<br>recognition, RSOs must abide by certain conditions. Critical here, all&para;<br>RSOs must comply with the school’s Nondiscrimination Policy, which&para;<br>tracks state law barring discrimination on a number of bases, includ&para;<br>ing religion and sexual orientation. Hastings interprets this policy, as&para;<br>it relates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all comers:&para;<br>RSOs must allow any student to participate, become a member, or&para;<br>seek leadership positions, regardless of her status or beliefs.&para;<br>At the beginning of the 2004–2005 academic year, the leaders of an&para;<br>existing Christian RSO formed petitioner Christian Legal Society&para;<br>(CLS) by affiliating with a national Christian association that char&para;<br>ters student chapters at law schools throughout the country. These&para;<br>chapters must adopt bylaws that, inter alia, require members and of&para;<br>ficers to sign a “Statement of Faith” and to conduct their lives in ac&para;<br>cord with prescribed principles. Among those tenets is the belief that&para;<br>sexual activity should not occur outside of marriage between a man&para;<br>and a woman. CLS interprets its bylaws to exclude from affiliation&para;<br>anyone who engages in “unrepentant homosexual conduct” or holds&para;<br>religious convictions different from those in the Statement of Faith.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., &para;<br>&para;<br>HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>Hastings rejected CLS’s application for RSO status on the ground&para;<br>that the group’s bylaws did not comply with Hastings’ open-access&para;<br>policy because they excluded students based on religion and sexual&para;<br>orientation.&para;<br>CLS filed this suit for injunctive and declaratory relief under 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §1983, alleging that Hastings’ refusal to grant the group&para;<br>RSO status violated its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to&para;<br>free speech, expressive association, and free exercise of religion. On&para;<br>cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled for&para;<br>Hastings. The court held that the all-comers condition on access to a&para;<br>limited public forum was both reasonable and viewpoint neutral, and&para;<br>therefore did not violate CLS’s right to free speech. Nor, in the&para;<br>court’s view, did Hastings impermissibly impair CLS’s right to ex&para;<br>pressive association: Hastings did not order CLS to admit any stu&para;<br>dent, nor did the school proscribe any speech; Hastings merely placed&para;<br>conditions on the use of school facilities and funds. The court also re&para;<br>jected CLS’s free exercise argument, stating that the Nondiscrimina&para;<br>tion Policy did not single out religious beliefs, but rather was neutral&para;<br>and of general applicability. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, ruling that&para;<br>the all-comers condition on RSO recognition was reasonable and&para;<br>viewpoint neutral.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The Court considers only whether a public institution’s condi&para;<br>tioning access to a student-organization forum on compliance with an&para;<br>all-comers policy violates the Constitution. CLS urges the Court to&para;<br>review, instead, the Nondiscrimination Policy as written—prohibiting&para;<br>discrimination on enumerated bases, including religion and sexual&para;<br>orientation. The policy’s written terms, CLS contends, target solely&para;<br>those groups that organize around religious beliefs or that disapprove&para;<br>of particular sexual behavior, and leave other associations free to&para;<br>limit membership to persons committed to the group’s ideology. This&para;<br>argument flatly contradicts the joint stipulation of facts the parties&para;<br>submitted at the summary-judgment stage, which specified: “Hast&para;<br>ings requires that [RSOs] allow any student to participate, . . . re&para;<br>gardless of [her] status or beliefs. For example, the Hastings Democ&para;<br>ratic Caucus cannot bar students holding Republican political beliefs&para;<br>. . . .” This Court has long recognized that parties are bound by, and&para;<br>cannot contradict, their stipulations. See, e.g., Board of Regents of&para;<br>Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, 226. The Court&para;<br>therefore rejects CLS’s attempt to escape from the stipulation and&para;<br>shift its target to Hastings’ policy as written. Pp. 8–12.&para;<br>2. The all-comers policy is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condi&para;<br>tion on access to the RSO forum; it therefore does not transgress&para;<br>First Amendment limitations. Pp. 12–31.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(a) The Court’s limited public forum decisions supply the appro&para;<br>priate framework for assessing both CLS’s free-speech and expres&para;<br>sive-association claims; those decisions recognize that a governmen&para;<br>tal entity, in regulating property in its charge, may impose&para;<br>restrictions on speech that are reasonable in light of the purposes of&para;<br>the forum and viewpoint neutral, e.g., Rosenberger v. Rector and Visi&para;<br>tors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 829. CLS urges the Court to apply&para;<br>to its expressive-association claim a different line of cases—decisions&para;<br>in which the Court has rigorously reviewed restrictions on associa&para;<br>tional freedom in the context of public accommodations, e.g., Roberts&para;<br>v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 623. But, because CLS’s ex&para;<br>pressive-association and free-speech arguments merge—who speaks&para;<br>on its behalf, CLS reasons, colors what concept is conveyed—it makes&para;<br>little sense to treat the claims as discrete. Instead, three observa&para;<br>tions lead the Court to analyze CLS’s arguments under limited&para;<br>public-forum precedents.&para;<br>First, the same considerations that have led the Court to apply a&para;<br>less restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited public forums, as&para;<br>compared to other environments, apply with equal force to expressive&para;<br>association occurring in a limited public forum. Speech and expres&para;<br>sive-association rights are closely linked. See id., at 622. When&para;<br>these intertwined rights arise in exactly the same context, it would&para;<br>be anomalous for a speech restriction to survive constitutional review&para;<br>under the limited-public-forum test only to be invalidated as an im&para;<br>permissible infringement of expressive association. Second, the strict&para;<br>scrutiny the Court has applied in some settings to laws that burden&para;<br>expressive association would, in practical effect, invalidate a defining&para;<br>characteristic of limited public forums—the State’s authority to “re&para;<br>serv[e] [them] for certain groups.” Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 829.&para;<br>Third, this case fits comfortably within the limited-public-forum&para;<br>category, for CLS may exclude any person for any reason if it forgoes&para;<br>the benefits of official recognition. The Court’s expressive-association&para;<br>decisions, in contrast, involved regulations that compelled a group to&para;<br>include unwanted members, with no choice to opt out. See, e.g., Boy&para;<br>Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U. S. 640, 648. Application of the less&para;<br>restrictive limited-public-forum analysis better accounts for the fact&para;<br>that Hastings, through its RSO program, is dangling the carrot of&para;<br>subsidy, not wielding the stick of prohibition. Pp. 12–17.&para;<br>(b) In three cases, this Court held that public universities had&para;<br>unconstitutionally singled out student groups for disfavored treat&para;<br>ment because of their points of view. See Healy v. James, 408 U. S.&para;<br>169; Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263; and Rosenberger. Most re&para;<br>cently and comprehensively, in Rosenberger, the Court held that a&para;<br>university generally may not withhold benefits from student groups&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., &para;<br>&para;<br>HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>because of their religious outlook. “Once it has opened a limited&para;<br>[public] forum,” the Court emphasized, “the State must respect the&para;<br>lawful boundaries it has itself set.” 515 U. S, at 829. It may “not ex&para;<br>clude speech where its distinction is not reasonable in light of the&para;<br>purpose served by the forum, . . . nor may it discriminate against&para;<br>speech on the basis of . . . viewpoint.” Ibid. Pp. 17–19.&para;<br>(c) Hastings’ all-comers policy is reasonable, taking into account&para;<br>the RSO forum’s function and “all the surrounding circumstances.”&para;<br>Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788,&para;<br>809. Pp. 19–28.&para;<br>(1) The Court’s inquiry is shaped by the educational context in&para;<br>which it arises: “First Amendment rights must be analyzed in light of&para;<br>the special characteristics of the school environment.” Widmar, 454&para;<br>U. S., at 268, n. 5. This Court is the final arbiter of whether a public&para;<br>university has exceeded constitutional constraints. The Court has,&para;<br>however, cautioned courts to resist “substitut[ing] their own notions&para;<br>of sound educational policy for those of . . . school authorities,” for&para;<br>judges lack the on-the-ground expertise and experience of school ad&para;<br>ministrators. Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist.,&para;<br>Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S. 176, 206. Because schools enjoy&para;<br>“a significant measure of authority over the type of officially recog&para;<br>nized activities in which their students participate,” Board of Ed. of&para;<br>Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226,&para;<br>240, the Court approaches its task here mindful that Hastings’ deci&para;<br>sions about the character of its student-group program are due de&para;<br>cent respect. Pp. 19–21.&para;<br>(2) The justifications Hastings asserts in support of its all&para;<br>comers policy are reasonable in light of the RSO forum’s purposes.&para;<br>First, the policy ensures that the leadership, educational, and social&para;<br>opportunities afforded by RSOs are available to all students. RSOs&para;<br>are eligible for financial assistance drawn from mandatory student&para;<br>activity fees; the policy ensures that no Hastings student is forced to&para;<br>fund a group that would reject her as a member. Second, the policy&para;<br>helps Hastings police the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Pol&para;<br>icy without inquiring into an RSO’s motivation for membership re&para;<br>strictions. CLS’s proposal that Hastings permit exclusion because of&para;<br>belief but forbid discrimination due to status would impose on Hast&para;<br>ings the daunting task of trying to determine whether a student or&para;<br>ganization cloaked prohibited status exclusion in belief-based garb.&para;<br>Third, Hastings reasonably adheres to the view that its policy, to the&para;<br>extent it brings together individuals with diverse backgrounds and&para;<br>beliefs, encourages tolerance, cooperation, and learning among stu&para;<br>dents. Fourth, the policy incorporates state-law discrimination pro&para;<br>scriptions, thereby conveying Hastings’ decision to decline to subsi&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>dize conduct disapproved by the State. So long as a public school&para;<br>does not contravene constitutional limits, its choice to advance state&para;<br>law goals stands on firm footing. Pp. 21–24.&para;<br>(3) Hastings’ policy is all the more creditworthy in light of the&para;<br>“substantial alternative channels that remain open for [CLS-student]&para;<br>communication to take place.” Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educa&para;<br>tors’ Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 53. Hastings offered CLS access to school&para;<br>facilities to conduct meetings and the use of chalkboards and certain&para;<br>bulletin boards to advertise events. Although CLS could not take ad&para;<br>vantage of RSO-specific methods of communication, the advent of&para;<br>electronic media and social-networking sites lessens the importance&para;<br>of those channels. Private groups, such as fraternities and sororities,&para;<br>commonly maintain a presence at universities without official school&para;<br>affiliation. CLS was similarly situated: It hosted a variety of activi&para;<br>ties the year after Hastings denied it recognition, and the number of&para;<br>students attending those meetings and events doubled. “The variety&para;<br>and type of alternative modes of access present here,” in short, “com&para;<br>pare favorably with those in other [limited public] forum cases where&para;<br>[the Court has] upheld restrictions.” Id., at 53–54. Pp. 24–25.&para;<br>(4) CLS’s arguments that the all-comers policy is not reason&para;<br>able are unavailing. CLS contends that there can be no diversity of&para;<br>viewpoints in a forum when groups are not permitted to form around&para;<br>viewpoints, but this argument confuses CLS’s preferred policy with&para;<br>constitutional limitation—the advisability of Hastings’ policy does&para;<br>not control its permissibility. A State’s restriction on access to a lim&para;<br>ited public forum, moreover, “need not be the most reasonable or the&para;<br>only reasonable limitation.” Cornelius, 473 U. S., at 808. CLS’s con&para;<br>tention that Hastings’ policy will facilitate hostile takeovers of RSOs&para;<br>by student saboteurs bent on subverting a group’s mission is more&para;<br>hypothetical than real; there is no history or prospect of RSO&para;<br>hijackings at Hastings. Cf. National Endowment for Arts v. Finley,&para;<br>524 U. S. 569, 584. Finally, CLS’s assertion that Hastings lacks any&para;<br>legitimate interest in urging religious groups not to favor co&para;<br>religionists erroneously focuses on the benefits the group must forgo,&para;<br>while ignoring the interests of those it seeks to fence out. Hastings,&para;<br>caught in the crossfire between a group’s desire to exclude and stu&para;<br>dents’ demand for equal access, may reasonably draw a line in the&para;<br>sand permitting all organizations to express what they wish but no&para;<br>group to discriminate in membership. Pp. 25–28.&para;<br>(d) Hastings’ all-comers policy is viewpoint neutral. Pp. 28–31.&para;<br>(1) The policy draws no distinction between groups based on&para;<br>their message or perspective; its requirement that all student groups&para;<br>accept all comers is textbook viewpoint neutral. Pp. 28–29.&para;<br>(2) Conceding that the policy is nominally neutral, CLS asserts&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., &para;<br>&para;<br>HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>that it systematically—and impermissibly—burdens most heavily&para;<br>those groups whose viewpoints are out of favor with the campus&para;<br>mainstream. This argument fails because “[a] regulation that serves&para;<br>purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral,&para;<br>even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but&para;<br>not others.” Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791. Hast&para;<br>ings’ requirement that RSOs accept all comers, the Court is satisfied,&para;<br>is “justified without reference to the content [or viewpoint] of the&para;<br>regulated speech.” Id., at 791. It targets the act of rejecting would-be&para;<br>group members without reference to the reasons motivating that be&para;<br>havior. Pp. 29–31.&para;<br>3. Neither lower court addressed CLS’s argument that Hastings se&para;<br>lectively enforces its all-comers policy. This Court is not the proper&para;<br>forum to air the issue in the first instance. On remand, the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit may consider this argument if, and to the extent, it is pre&para;<br>served. Pp. 31–32.&para;<br>&para;<br>319 Fed.

See&para;<br>Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515&para;<br>U. S. 819 (1995); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981);&para;<br>Healy v. James, 408 U. S. 169 (1972). This case concerns a&para;<br>novel question regarding student activities at public uni­&para;<br>versities: May a public law school condition its official&para;<br>recognition of a student group—and the attendant use of&para;<br>school funds and facilities—on the organization’s agree­&para;<br>ment to open eligibility for membership and leadership to&para;<br>all students?&para;<br>In the view of petitioner Christian Legal Society (CLS),&para;<br>an accept-all-comers policy impairs its First Amendment&para;<br>rights to free speech, expressive association, and free&para;<br>exercise of religion by prompting it, on pain of relinquish­&para;<br>ing the advantages of recognition, to accept members who&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC.

MARTINEZ &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>do not share the organization’s core beliefs about religion&para;<br>and sexual orientation. From the perspective of respon­&para;<br>dent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings or the Law&para;<br>School), CLS seeks special dispensation from an across­&para;<br>the-board open-access requirement designed to further the&para;<br>reasonable educational purposes underpinning the school’s&para;<br>student-organization program.&para;<br>In accord with the District Court and the Court of Ap­&para;<br>peals, we reject CLS’s First Amendment challenge. Com­&para;<br>pliance with Hastings’ all-comers policy, we conclude, is a&para;<br>reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the&para;<br>student-organization forum. In requiring CLS—in com­&para;<br>mon with all other student organizations—to choose be­&para;<br>tween welcoming all students and forgoing the benefits of&para;<br>official recognition, we hold, Hastings did not transgress&para;<br>constitutional limitations. CLS, it bears emphasis, seeks&para;<br>not parity with other organizations, but a preferential&para;<br>exemption from Hastings’ policy. The First Amendment&para;<br>shields CLS against state prohibition of the organization’s&para;<br>expressive activity, however exclusionary that activity&para;<br>may be. But CLS enjoys no constitutional right to state&para;<br>subvention of its selectivity.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Founded in 1878, Hastings was the first law school in&para;<br>the University of California public-school system. Like&para;<br>many institutions of higher education, Hastings encour­&para;<br>ages students to form extracurricular associations that&para;<br>“contribute to the Hastings community and experience.”&para;<br>App. 349. These groups offer students “opportunities to&para;<br>pursue academic and social interests outside of the class­&para;<br>room [to] further their education” and to help them “de­&para;<br>velo[p] leadership skills.” Ibid.&para;<br>Through its “Registered Student Organization” (RSO)&para;<br>program, Hastings extends official recognition to student&para;<br>groups.

First, in a progression of cases, this Court has&para;<br>employed forum analysis to determine when a governmen­&para;<br>tal entity, in regulating property in its charge, may place&para;<br>limitations on speech.11 Recognizing a State’s right “to&para;<br>preserve the property under its control for the use to&para;<br>which it is lawfully dedicated,” Cornelius v. NAACP Legal&para;<br>Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U.

Post, at 2, 3,&para;<br>5, 18–23. We decline to address these arguments, not because we agree&para;<br>with the dissent that the Nondiscrimination Policy is “plainly” uncon­&para;<br>stitutional, post, at 18, but because, as noted, supra, at 8–12, that&para;<br>constitutional question is not properly presented.&para;<br>11 In conducting forum analysis, our decisions have sorted govern­&para;<br>ment property into three categories. First, in traditional public forums,&para;<br>such as public streets and parks, “any restriction based on the content&para;<br>of . . . speech must satisfy strict scrutiny, that is, the restriction must&para;<br>be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.”&para;<br>Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6).&para;<br>Second, governmental entities create designated public forums when&para;<br>“government property that has not traditionally been regarded as a&para;<br>public forum is intentionally opened up for that purpose”; speech&para;<br>restrictions in such a forum “are subject to the same strict scrutiny as&para;<br>restrictions in a traditional public forum.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 7).&para;<br>Third, governmental entities establish limited public forums by opening&para;<br>property “limited to use by certain groups or dedicated solely to the&para;<br>discussion of certain subjects.” Ibid. As noted in text, “[i]n such a&para;<br>forum, a governmental entity may impose restrictions on speech that&para;<br>are reasonable and viewpoint-neutral.” Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 829. See also, e.g., Good News&para;<br>Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106–107&para;<br>(2001); Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free&para;<br>School Dist., 508 U.

S. 37, 46&para;<br>(1983).12&para;<br>Second, as evidenced by another set of decisions, this&para;<br>Court has rigorously reviewed laws and regulations that&para;<br>constrain associational freedom. In the context of public&para;<br>accommodations, we have subjected restrictions on that&para;<br>freedom to close scrutiny; such restrictions are permitted&para;<br>only if they serve “compelling state interests” that are&para;<br>“unrelated to the suppression of ideas”—interests that&para;<br>cannot be advanced “through . . . significantly less restric­&para;<br>tive [means].” Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S.&para;<br>609, 623 (1984). See also, e.g., Boy Scouts of America v.&para;<br>Dale, 530 U. S. 640, 648 (2000). “Freedom of association,”&para;<br>we have recognized, “plainly presupposes a freedom not to&para;<br>associate.” Roberts, 468 U. S., at 623. Insisting that an&para;<br>organization embrace unwelcome members, we have&para;<br>therefore concluded, “directly and immediately affects&para;<br>associational rights.” Dale, 530 U.

It therefore makes little&para;<br>sense to treat CLS’s speech and association claims as&para;<br>discrete. See Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for&para;<br>Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290, 300 (1981). In­&para;<br>stead, three observations lead us to conclude that our&para;<br>limited-public-forum precedents supply the appropriate&para;<br>framework for assessing both CLS’s speech and associa­&para;<br>tion rights.&para;<br>First, the same considerations that have led us to apply&para;<br>a less restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited&para;<br>public forums as compared to other environments, see&para;<br>supra, at 12–13, and n. 11, apply with equal force to ex­&para;<br>pressive association occurring in limited public forums. As&para;<br>just noted, speech and expressive-association rights are&para;<br>closely linked. See Roberts, 468 U. S., at 622 (Associa­&para;<br>tional freedom is “implicit in the right to engage in activi­&para;<br>ties protected by the First Amendment.”). When these&para;<br>intertwined rights arise in exactly the same context, it&para;<br>would be anomalous for a restriction on speech to survive&para;<br>constitutional review under our limited-public-forum test&para;<br>only to be invalidated as an impermissible infringement of&para;<br>expressive association. Accord Brief for State Universities&para;<br>and State University Systems as Amici Curiae 37–38.&para;<br>That result would be all the more anomalous in this case,&para;<br>for CLS suggests that its expressive-association claim&para;<br>plays a part auxiliary to speech’s starring role. See Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 18.&para;<br>Second, and closely related, the strict scrutiny we have&para;<br>applied in some settings to laws that burden expressive&para;<br>association would, in practical effect, invalidate a defining&para;<br>characteristic of limited public forums—the State may&para;<br>“reserv[e] [them] for certain groups.” Rosenberger, 515&para;<br>U.

Application of the&para;<br>less-restrictive limited-public-forum analysis better ac­&para;<br>counts for the fact that Hastings, through its RSO pro­&para;<br>gram, is dangling the carrot of subsidy, not wielding the&para;<br>stick of prohibition.

Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of&para;<br>Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557 (1995). There, a veterans group sponsoring&para;<br>a St. Patrick’s Day parade challenged a state law requiring it to allow&para;<br>gay individuals to march in the parade behind a banner celebrating&para;<br>their Irish heritage and sexual orientation. Id., at 572. In evaluating&para;<br>that challenge, the Hurley Court focused on the veterans group’s&para;<br>interest in controlling the message conveyed by the organization. See&para;<br>id., at 573–581. Whether Hurley is best conceptualized as a speech or&para;<br>association case (or both), however, that precedent is of little help to&para;<br>CLS.&para;<br>Hurley involved the application of a statewide public­&para;<br>accommodations law to the most traditional of public forums: the&para;<br>street. That context differs markedly from the limited public forum at&para;<br>issue here: a university’s application of an all-comers policy to its&para;<br>student-organization program.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

First, in Healy, a state college denied school affilia­&para;<br>tion to a student group that wished to form a local chapter&para;<br>of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). 408 U. S., at&para;<br>170. Characterizing SDS’s mission as violent and disrup­&para;<br>tive, and finding the organization’s philosophy repugnant,&para;<br>the college completely banned the SDS chapter from cam­&para;<br>pus; in its effort to sever all channels of communication&para;<br>between students and the group, university officials went&para;<br>so far as to disband a meeting of SDS members in a cam­&para;<br>pus coffee shop. Id., at 174–176. The college, we noted,&para;<br>could require “that a group seeking official recognition&para;<br>affirm in advance its willingness to adhere to reasonable&para;<br>campus law,” including “reasonable standards respecting&para;<br>conduct.” Id., at 193. But a public educational institution&para;<br>exceeds constitutional bounds, we held, when it “restrict[s]&para;<br>speech or association simply because it finds the views&para;<br>expressed by [a] group to be abhorrent.” Id., at 187–188.15&para;<br>——————&para;<br>15 The dissent relies heavily on Healy, post, at 13–17, but its other­&para;<br>wise exhaustive account of the case elides the very fact the Healy Court&para;<br>identified as dispositive: The president of the college explicitly denied&para;<br>the student group official recognition because of the group’s viewpoint.&para;<br>See 408 U. S, at 187 (“The mere disagreement of the President with the&para;<br>group’s philosophy affords no reason to deny it recognition.”). In this&para;<br>case, in contrast, Hastings denied CLS recognition not because the&para;<br>school wanted to silence the “viewpoint that CLS sought to express&para;<br>through its membership requirements,” post, at 17, n. 2, but because&para;<br>CLS, insisting on preferential treatment, declined to comply with the&para;<br>open-access policy applicable to all RSOs, see R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505&para;<br>U. S. 377, 390 (1992) (“Where the [State] does not target conduct on the&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV.

In that case, a&para;<br>public university, in an effort to avoid state support for&para;<br>religion, had closed its facilities to a registered student&para;<br>group that sought to use university space for religious&para;<br>worship and discussion. 454 U. S., at 264–265. “A univer­&para;<br>sity’s mission is education,” we observed, “and decisions of&para;<br>this Court have never denied a university’s authority to&para;<br>impose reasonable regulations compatible with that mis­&para;<br>sion upon the use of its campus and facilities.” Id., at 268,&para;<br>n. 5. But because the university singled out religious&para;<br>organizations for disadvantageous treatment, we sub­&para;<br>jected the university’s regulation to strict scrutiny. Id., at&para;<br>269–270. The school’s interest “in maintaining strict&para;<br>separation of church and State,” we held, was not “suffi­&para;<br>ciently compelling to justify . . . [viewpoint] discrimination&para;<br>against . . . religious speech.” Id., at 270, 276 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Most recently and comprehensively, in Rosenberger, we&para;<br>reiterated that a university generally may not withhold&para;<br>benefits from student groups because of their religious&para;<br>outlook.

As discussed infra, at 28–31, Hastings’ all-comers policy is&para;<br>paradigmatically viewpoint neutral. The dissent’s contention that “the&para;<br>identity of the student group” is the only “way of distinguishing Healy,”&para;<br>post, at 16, is thus untenable.&para;<br>The dissent’s description of Healy also omits the Healy Court’s&para;<br>observation that “[a] college administration may . . . requir[e] . . . that a&para;<br>group seeking official recognition affirm in advance its willingness to&para;<br>adhere to reasonable campus law.

By&para;<br>“select[ing] for disfavored treatment those student journal­&para;<br>istic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints,” we held,&para;<br>the university had engaged in “viewpoint discrimination,&para;<br>which is presumed impermissible when directed against&para;<br>speech otherwise within the forum’s limitations.” Id., at&para;<br>831, 830.&para;<br>In all three cases, we ruled that student groups had&para;<br>been unconstitutionally singled out because of their points&para;<br>of view. “Once it has opened a limited [public] forum,” we&para;<br>emphasized, “the State must respect the lawful bounda­&para;<br>ries it has itself set.” Id., at 829. The constitutional con­&para;<br>straints on the boundaries the State may set bear repeti­&para;<br>tion here: “The State may not exclude speech where its&para;<br>distinction is not reasonable in light of the purpose served&para;<br>by the forum, . . . nor may it discriminate against speech&para;<br>on the basis of . . . viewpoint.” Ibid. (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted).&para;<br>C&para;<br>We first consider whether Hastings’ policy is reasonable&para;<br>taking into account the RSO forum’s function and “all the&para;<br>surrounding circumstances.” Cornelius, 473 U.

This Court&para;<br>is the final arbiter of the question whether a public uni­&para;<br>versity has exceeded constitutional constraints, and we&para;<br>owe no deference to universities when we consider that&para;<br>question.

See post, at 1, 15–16, 27. As noted supra, at 19–20, this&para;<br>Court, exercising its independent judgment, must “interpre[t] and&para;<br>appl[y] . . . the right to free speech.” Post, at 16. But determinations of&para;<br>what constitutes sound educational policy or what goals a student­&para;<br>organization forum ought to serve fall within the discretion of school&para;<br>administrators and educators. See, e.g., Board of Ed. of Hendrick&para;<br>Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U. S. 176,&para;<br>206 (1982).&para;<br>17 Although the dissent maintains it is “content to address the consti­&para;<br>tutionality of Hastings’ actions under our limited public forum cases,”&para;<br>post, at 17, it resists the import of those cases at every turn. For&para;<br>example, although the dissent acknowledges that a university has the&para;<br>authority to set the boundaries of a limited public forum, post, at 17, 24,&para;<br>the dissent refuses to credit Hastings’ all-comers policy as one of those&para;<br>boundaries. See ibid. (insisting that “Hastings’ regulations . . . impose&para;<br>only two substantive limitations: A group . . . must have student&para;<br>members and must be non-commercial.”). In short, “the design of the&para;<br>RSO forum,” post, at 26, which the dissent discusses at length, post, at&para;<br>24–31, is of its own tailoring.&para;<br>Another example: The dissent pointedly observes that “[w]hile there&para;<br>can be no question that the State of California could not impose [an all­&para;<br>comers] restrictio[n] on all religious groups in the State, the Court now&para;<br>holds that Hastings, a state institution, may impose these very same&para;<br>requirements on students who wish to participate in a forum that is&para;<br>designed to foster the expression of diverse viewpoints.” Post, at 27. As&para;<br>noted supra, at 12–13, and n. 11, this difference reflects the lesser&para;<br>standard of scrutiny applicable to limited public forums compared to&para;<br>other forums. The dissent fights the distinction between state prohibi&para;<br>tion and state support, but its real quarrel is with our limited public&para;<br>forum doctrine, which recognizes that distinction. CLS, it bears repeti­&para;<br>tion, remains free to express whatever it will, but it cannot insist on an&para;<br>exemption from Hastings’ embracive all-comers policy.&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC.

RSOs,&para;<br>we count it significant, are eligible for financial assistance drawn from mandatory student-activity fees, see&para;<br>supra, at 3; the all-comers policy ensures that no Hastings&para;<br>student is forced to fund a group that would reject her as a&para;<br>member.18&para;<br>Second, the all-comers requirement helps Hastings&para;<br>police the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Policy&para;<br>without inquiring into an RSO’s motivation for member­&para;<br>ship restrictions. To bring the RSO program within CLS’s&para;<br>view of the Constitution’s limits, CLS proposes that Hast­&para;<br>ings permit exclusion because of belief but forbid discrimi­&para;<br>nation due to status.

There are nu&para;<br>merous reasons why this counterintuitive theory is&para;<br>unsound. Although the First Amendment may protect&para;<br>CLS’s discriminatory practices off campus, it does not&para;<br>require a public university to validate or support them.&para;<br>As written, the Nondiscrimination Policy is content and&para;<br>viewpoint neutral. It does not reflect a judgment by school&para;<br>officials about the substance of any student group’s&para;<br>speech. Nor does it exclude any would-be groups on the&para;<br>basis of their convictions. Indeed, it does not regulate&para;<br>expression or belief at all. The policy is “directed at the&para;<br>organization’s activities rather than its philosophy,” Healy&para;<br>v. James, 408 U. S. 169, 188 (1972). Those who hold reli&para;<br>gious beliefs are not “singled out,” post, at 19 (ALITO, J.,&para;<br>dissenting); those who engage in discriminatory conduct&para;<br>based on someone else’s religious status and belief are&para;<br>singled out.1 Regardless of whether they are the product&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The dissent appears to accept that Hastings may prohibit discrimi&para;<br>nation on the basis of religious status, though it rejects the notion that&para;<br>Hastings may do the same for religious belief. See, e.g., post, at 22, n. 5,&para;<br>28. If CLS sought to exclude a Muslim student in virtue of the fact that&para;<br>he “is” Muslim, the dissent suggests, there would be no problem in&para;<br>Hastings forbidding that. But if CLS sought to exclude the same&para;<br>student in virtue of the fact that he subscribes to the Muslim faith,&para;<br>Hastings must stand idly by. This proposition is not only unworkable&para;<br>in practice but also flawed in conception. A person’s religion often&para;<br>simultaneously constitutes or informs a status, an identity, a set of&para;<br>beliefs and practices, and much else besides. (So does sexual orienta&para;<br>tion for that matter, see ante, at 22–23, notwithstanding the dissent’s&para;<br>view that a rule excluding those who engage in “unrepentant homosex&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

There is,&para;<br>moreover, no evidence that the policy was adopted because&para;<br>of any reason related to the particular views that religious&para;<br>individuals or groups might have, much less because of a&para;<br>desire to suppress or distort those views. The policy’s&para;<br>religion clause was plainly meant to promote, not to un&para;<br>dermine, religious freedom.&para;<br>To be sure, the policy may end up having greater conse&para;<br>quence for religious groups—whether and to what extent&para;<br>it will is far from clear ex ante—inasmuch as they are&para;<br>more likely than their secular counterparts to wish to&para;<br>exclude students of particular faiths. But there is likewise&para;<br>no evidence that the policy was intended to cause harm to&para;<br>religious groups, or that it has in practice caused signifi&para;<br>cant harm to their operations. And it is a basic tenet of&para;<br>First Amendment law that disparate impact does not, in&para;<br>itself, constitute viewpoint discrimination.2 The dissent&para;<br>——————&para;<br>ual conduct,” App. 226, does not discriminate on the basis of status or&para;<br>identity, post, at 22–23.)

Public universities serve a distinctive role in a mod&para;<br>ern democratic society.

In July 2005, Mary Kay Kane, then the dean of&para;<br>the law school, was deposed, and she stated: “It is my view&para;<br>that in order to be a registered student organization you&para;<br>have to allow all of our students to be members and full&para;<br>participants if they want to.” App. 343. In a declaration&para;<br>filed in October 2005, Ms. Chapman provided a more&para;<br>developed explanation, stating: “Hastings interprets the&para;<br>Nondiscrimination Policy as requiring that student or&para;<br>ganizations wishing to register with Hastings allow any&para;<br>Hastings student to become a member and/or seek a lead&para;<br>ership position in the organization.” Id., at 349.&para;<br>Hastings claims that this accept-all-comers policy has&para;<br>existed since 1990 but points to no evidence that the policy&para;<br>was ever put in writing or brought to the attention of&para;<br>members of the law school community prior to the dean’s&para;<br>deposition. Indeed, Hastings has adduced no evidence of&para;<br>the policy’s existence before that date. And while Dean&para;<br>Kane and Ms. Chapman stated, well after this litigation&para;<br>had begun, that Hastings had such a policy, neither they&para;<br>nor any other Hastings official has ever stated in a deposi&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tion, affidavit, or declaration when this policy took effect.&para;<br>Hastings’ effort to portray the accept-all-comers policy&para;<br>as merely an interpretation of the Nondiscrimination&para;<br>Policy runs into obvious difficulties. First, the two policies&para;<br>are simply not the same: The Nondiscrimination Policy&para;<br>proscribes discrimination on a limited number of specified&para;<br>grounds, while the accept-all-comers policy outlaws all&para;<br>selectivity. Second, the Nondiscrimination Policy applies&para;<br>to everything that Hastings does, and the law school does&para;<br>not follow an accept-all-comers policy in activities such as&para;<br>admitting students and hiring faculty.&para;<br>In an effort to circumvent this problem, the Court writes&para;<br>that “Hastings interprets the Nondiscrimination Policy, as&para;<br>it relates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all&para;<br>comers.” Ante, at 4 (emphasis added). This puts Hastings&para;<br>in the implausible position of maintaining that the Non&para;<br>discrimination Policy means one thing as applied to the&para;<br>RSO program and something quite different as applied to&para;<br>all of Hastings’ other activities. But the Nondiscrimina&para;<br>tion Policy by its terms applies fully to all components of&para;<br>the law school, “including administration [and] faculty.”&para;<br>App. 220.&para;<br>Third, the record is replete with evidence that, at least&para;<br>until Dean Kane unveiled the accept-all-comers policy in&para;<br>July 2005, Hastings routinely registered student groups&para;<br>with bylaws limiting membership and leadership positions&para;<br>to those who agreed with the groups’ viewpoints. For&para;<br>example, the bylaws of the Hastings Democratic Caucus&para;<br>provided that “any full-time student at Hastings may&para;<br>become a member of HDC so long as they do not exhibit a&para;<br>consistent disregard and lack of respect for the objective of&para;<br>the organization as stated in Article 3, Section 1.” App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 118a (emphasis added). The constitution of&para;<br>the Association of Trial Lawyers of America at Hastings&para;<br>provided that every member must “adhere to the objec&para;<br>tives of the Student Chapter as well as the mission of&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL., &para;<br>&para;<br>HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ &para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>ATLA.” Id., at 110a. A student could become a member of&para;<br>the Vietnamese American Law Society so long as the&para;<br>student did not “exhibit a consistent disregard and lack of&para;<br>respect for the objective of the organization,” which cen&para;<br>ters on a “celebrat[ion] [of] Vietnamese culture.” Id., at&para;<br>146a–147a. Silenced Right limited voting membership to&para;<br>students who “are committed” to the group’s “mission” of&para;<br>“spread[ing] the pro-life message.” Id., at 142a–143a. La&para;<br>Raza limited voting membership to “students of Raza&para;<br>background.” App. 192. Since Hastings requires any&para;<br>student group applying for registration to submit a copy of&para;<br>its bylaws, see id., at 249–250, Hastings cannot claim that&para;<br>it was unaware of such provisions. And as noted, CLS was&para;<br>denied registration precisely because Ms. Chapman re&para;<br>viewed its bylaws and found them unacceptable.&para;<br>We are told that, when CLS pointed out these discrep&para;<br>ancies during this litigation, Hastings took action to en&para;<br>sure that student groups were in fact complying with the&para;<br>law school’s newly disclosed accept-all-comers policy. For&para;<br>example, Hastings asked La Raza to revise its bylaws to&para;<br>allow all students to become voting members. App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 66a. See also Brief for State of Michigan et al. as&para;<br>Amici Curiae 2, n. 1 (relating anecdotally that Hastings&para;<br>recently notified the Hastings Democrats that “to main&para;<br>tain the Club’s standing as a student organization,” it&para;<br>must “open its membership to all students, regardless of&para;<br>party affiliation”). These belated remedial efforts suggest,&para;<br>if anything, that Hastings had no accept-all-comers policy&para;<br>until this litigation was well under way.&para;<br>Finally, when Hastings filed its brief in this Court, its&para;<br>policy, which had already evolved from a policy prohibiting&para;<br>certain specified forms of discrimination into an accept-all&para;<br>comers policy, underwent yet another transformation.&para;<br>Now, Hastings claims that it does not really have an&para;<br>accept-all-comers policy; it has an accept-some-comers&para;<br>policy. Hastings’ current policy, we are told, “does not&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Hastings’ brief&para;<br>goes on to note with seeming approval that some regis&para;<br>tered groups have imposed “even conduct requirements.”&para;<br>Ibid. Hastings, however, has not told us which “conduct&para;<br>requirements” are allowed and which are not—although&para;<br>presumably requirements regarding sexual conduct fall&para;<br>into the latter category.&para;<br>When this case was in the District Court, that court&para;<br>took care to address both the Nondiscrimination Policy&para;<br>and the accept-all-comers policy. See, e.g., App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 8a–9a, 16a–17a, 21a–24a, 26a, 27a, 32a, 44a, 63a.&para;<br>On appeal, however, a panel of the Ninth Circuit, like the&para;<br>Court today, totally ignored the Nondiscrimination Policy.&para;<br>CLS’s argument in the Ninth Circuit centered on the&para;<br>Nondiscrimination Policy, and CLS argued strenuously, as&para;<br>it had in the District Court, that prior to the former dean’s&para;<br>deposition, numerous groups had been permitted to re&para;<br>strict membership to students who shared the groups’&para;<br>views.1 Nevertheless, the Ninth Circuit disposed of CLS’s&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 CLS consistently argued in the courts below that Hastings had ap&para;<br>plied its registration policy in a discriminatory manner. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Plaintiff’s Notice of Motion for Summary Judgment and Memorandum&para;<br>in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment in No. C 04–4484–JSW&para;<br>(ND Cal.), pp. 6–7 (“Hastings allows other registered student organiza&para;<br>tions to require that their members and/or leaders agree with the&para;<br>organization’s beliefs and purposes”). CLS took pains to bring forward&para;<br>evidence to substantiate this claim. See supra, at 7–8.&para;<br>CLS’s brief in the Court of Appeals reiterated its contention that&para;<br>Hastings had not required all RSOs to admit all student applicants.&para;<br>CLS’s brief stated that “Hastings allows other registered student&para;<br>organizations to require that their leaders and/or members agree with&para;<br>the organization’s beliefs and purposes.” Brief for Appellant in No. 06–&para;<br>15956 (CA9), pp. 14–15 (citing examples).

Appx.&para;<br>645–646 (2009).&para;<br>Like the majority of this Court, the Ninth Circuit relied&para;<br>on the following Joint Stipulation, which the parties filed&para;<br>in December 2005, well after Dean Kane’s deposition:&para;<br>“Hastings requires that registered student organiza&para;<br>tions allow any student to participate, become a mem&para;<br>ber, or seek leadership positions in the organization,&para;<br>regardless of their status or beliefs.” App. 221.&para;<br>Citing the binding effect of stipulations, the majority&para;<br>sternly rejects what it terms “CLS’s unseemly attempt to&para;<br>escape from the stipulation and shift its target to [the&para;<br>Nondiscrimination Policy].” Ante, at 11–12.&para;<br>I agree that the parties must be held to their Joint&para;<br>Stipulation, but the terms of the stipulation should be&para;<br>respected. What was admitted in the Joint Stipulation&para;<br>filed in December 2005 is that Hastings had an accept-all&para;<br>comers policy. CLS did not stipulate that its application&para;<br>had been denied more than a year earlier pursuant to such&para;<br>a policy. On the contrary, the Joint Stipulation notes that&para;<br>the reason repeatedly given by Hasting at that time was&para;<br>that the CLS bylaws did not comply with the Nondis&para;<br>crimination Policy. See App. 228–229. Indeed, the parties&para;<br>did not even stipulate that the accept-all-comers policy&para;<br>existed in the fall of 2004. In addition, Hastings itself is&para;<br>now attempting to walk away from this stipulation by&para;<br>disclosing that its real policy is an accept-some-comers&para;<br>policy.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>not discriminate on the basis of belief”). Responding to these argu&para;<br>ments, the law school remarked that CLS “repeatedly asserts that&para;<br>‘Hastings routinely recognizes student groups that limit membership or&para;<br>leadership on the basis of belief.’ ” Brief for Appellees in No. 06–15956&para;<br>(CA9), p. 4.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Community&para;<br>First Bank, 123 F. 3d 1243, 1248 (CA9 1997) (quoting&para;<br>Lacelaw, supra). As noted above, Hastings admitted in its&para;<br>answer, which was filed prior to the former dean’s deposi&para;<br>tion, that at least as of that time, the law school did not&para;<br>follow an accept-all-comers policy and instead allowed&para;<br>“political, social, and cultural student organizations to&para;<br>select officers and members who are dedicated to a par&para;<br>ticular set of ideals or beliefs.” App. 93.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Court also distorts the record with respect to the&para;<br>effect on CLS of Hastings’ decision to deny registration.&para;<br>The Court quotes a letter written by Hastings’ general&para;<br>counsel in which she stated that Hastings “ ‘would be&para;<br>pleased to provide [CLS] the use of Hastings facilities for&para;<br>its meetings and activities.’ ” Ante, at 6 (quoting App.&para;<br>294). Later in its opinion, the Court reiterates that “Hast&para;<br>ings offered CLS access to school facilities to conduct&para;<br>meetings,” ante, at 24, but the majority does not mention&para;<br>that this offer was subject to important qualifications. As&para;<br>Hastings’ attorney put it in the District Court, Hastings&para;<br>told CLS: “ ‘Hastings allows community groups to some&para;<br>degree to use its facilities, sometimes on a pay basis, I&para;<br>understand, if they’re available after priority is given to&para;<br>registered organizations’. We offered that.” App. 442.&para;<br>The Court also fails to mention what happened when&para;<br>CLS attempted to take advantage of Hastings’ offer. On&para;<br>August 19, 2005, the local CLS president sent an e-mail to&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,&para;<br>HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v.

Id., at 298. This request—&para;<br>merely to set up a table on a patio—could hardly have&para;<br>interfered with any other use of the law school’s premises&para;<br>or cost the school any money. But although the request&para;<br>was labeled “time sensitive,” ibid., Ms. Chapman did not&para;<br>respond until the dates in question had passed, and she&para;<br>then advised the student that all further inquiries should&para;<br>be made through CLS’s attorney. Id., at 297–298.&para;<br>In September 2005, CLS tried again. Through counsel,&para;<br>CLS sought to reserve a room on campus for a guest&para;<br>speaker who was scheduled to appear on a specified date.&para;<br>Id., at 302–303. Noting Ms. Chapman’s tardy response on&para;<br>the prior occasion, the attorney asked to receive a re&para;<br>sponse before the scheduled date, but once again no an&para;<br>swer was given until after the date had passed. Id., at&para;<br>300.&para;<br>Other statements in the majority opinion make it seem&para;<br>as if the denial of registration did not hurt CLS at all. The&para;<br>Court notes that CLS was able to hold Bible-study meet&para;<br>ings and other events. Ante, at 6. And “[a]lthough CLS&para;<br>could not take advantage of RSO-specific methods of com&para;<br>munication,” the Court states, “the advent of electronic&para;<br>media and social-networking sites reduces the importance&para;<br>of those channels.” Ante, at 24.&para;<br>At the beginning of the 2005 school year, the Hastings&para;<br>CLS group had seven members, App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a,&para;<br>so there can be no suggestion that the group flourished.&para;<br>And since one of CLS’s principal claims is that it was&para;<br>subjected to discrimination based on its viewpoint, the&para;<br>majority’s emphasis on CLS’s ability to endure that dis&para;<br>crimination—by using private facilities and means of&para;<br>communication—is quite amazing.&para;<br>This Court does not customarily brush aside a claim of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

We&para;<br>have never before taken the view that a little viewpoint&para;<br>discrimination is acceptable. Nor have we taken this&para;<br>approach in other discrimination cases.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Finally, I must comment on the majority’s emphasis on&para;<br>funding. According to the majority, CLS is “seeking what&para;<br>is effectively a state subsidy,” ante, at 15, and the question&para;<br>presented in this case centers on the “use of school funds,”&para;<br>ante, at 1. In fact, funding plays a very small role in this&para;<br>case. Most of what CLS sought and was denied—such as&para;<br>permission to set up a table on the law school patio—&para;<br>would have been virtually cost free. If every such activity&para;<br>is regarded as a matter of funding, the First Amendment&para;<br>rights of students at public universities will be at the&para;<br>mercy of the administration. As CLS notes, “[t]o univer&para;<br>sity students, the campus is their world. The right to&para;<br>meet on campus and use campus channels of communica&para;<br>tion is at least as important to university students as the&para;<br>right to gather on the town square and use local communi&para;<br>cation forums is to the citizen.” Reply Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>13.&para;<br>II&para;<br>To appreciate how far the Court has strayed, it is in&para;<br>structive to compare this case with Healy v. James, 408&para;<br>U. S. 169 (1972), our only First Amendment precedent&para;<br>involving a public college’s refusal to recognize a student&para;<br>group. The group in Healy was a local chapter of the&para;<br>Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). When the stu&para;<br>dents who applied for recognition of the chapter were&para;<br>asked by a college committee whether they would “ ‘re&para;<br>spond to issues of violence as other S.D.S. chapters have,’ ”&para;<br>their answer was that their “ ‘action would have to be&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,&para;<br>HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>dependent upon each issue.’ ” Id., at 172–173. They simi&para;<br>larly refused to provide a definitive answer when asked&para;<br>whether they would be willing to “use any means possible”&para;<br>to achieve their aims. Id., at 173. The president of the&para;<br>college refused to allow the group to be recognized, con&para;<br>cluding that the philosophy of the SDS was “antithetical to&para;<br>the school’s policies” and that it was doubtful that the&para;<br>local chapter was independent of the national organiza&para;<br>tion, the “ ‘published aims and philosophy’ ” of which in&para;<br>cluded “ ‘disruption and violence.’ ” Id., at 174–175, and&para;<br>n. 4.&para;<br>The effects of nonrecognition in Healy were largely the&para;<br>same as those present here. The SDS was denied the use&para;<br>of campus facilities, as well as access to the customary&para;<br>means used for communication among the members of the&para;<br>college community. Id., at 176, 181–182.&para;<br>The lower federal courts held that the First Amendment&para;<br>rights of the SDS chapter had not been violated, and when&para;<br>the case reached this Court, the college, much like today’s&para;<br>majority, sought to minimize the effects of nonrecognition,&para;<br>arguing that the SDS members “still may meet as a group&para;<br>off campus, that they still may distribute written material&para;<br>off campus, and that they still may meet together infor&para;<br>mally on campus . . . as individuals.” Id., at 182–183.&para;<br>This Court took a different view. The Court held that&para;<br>the denial of recognition substantially burdened the stu&para;<br>dents’ right to freedom of association. After observing that&para;<br>“[t]he primary impediment to free association flowing from&para;<br>nonrecognition is the denial of use of campus facilities for&para;<br>meetings and other appropriate purposes,” id., at 181, the&para;<br>Court continued:&para;<br>“Petitioners’ associational interests also were cir&para;<br>cumscribed by the denial of the use of campus bulletin&para;<br>boards and the school newspaper. If an organization&para;<br>is to remain a viable entity in a campus community in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>which new students enter on a regular basis, it must&para;<br>possess the means of communicating with these stu&para;<br>dents. Moreover, the organization’s ability to partici&para;<br>pate in the intellectual give and take of campus de&para;<br>bate, and to pursue its stated purposes, is limited by&para;<br>denial of access to the customary media for communi&para;<br>cating with the administration, faculty members, and&para;<br>other students. Such impediments cannot be viewed&para;<br>as insubstantial.” Id., at 181–182.&para;<br>It is striking that all of these same burdens are now&para;<br>borne by CLS. CLS is prevented from using campus facili&para;<br>ties—unless at some future time Hastings chooses to&para;<br>provide a timely response to a CLS request and allow the&para;<br>group, as a favor or perhaps in exchange for a fee, to set&para;<br>up a table on the patio or to use a room that would other&para;<br>wise be unoccupied. And CLS, like the SDS in Healy, has&para;<br>been cut off from “the customary media for communicating&para;<br>with the administration, faculty members, and other&para;<br>students.” Id., at 181–182.&para;<br>It is also telling that the Healy Court, unlike today’s&para;<br>majority, refused to defer to the college president’s judg&para;<br>ment regarding the compatibility of “sound educational&para;<br>policy” and free speech rights. The same deference argu&para;<br>ments that the majority now accepts were made in defense&para;<br>of the college president’s decision to deny recognition in&para;<br>Healy. Respondents in that case emphasized that the&para;<br>college president, not the courts, had the responsibility of&para;<br>administering the institution and that the courts should&para;<br>allow him “ ‘wide discretion . . . in determining what ac&para;<br>tions are most compatible with its educational objectives.’ ”&para;<br>Brief for Respondents in Healy v. James, O. T. 1971, No.&para;<br>71–452, pp. 7–8.

Unlike the&para;<br>Court today, the Healy Court emphatically rejected the&para;<br>proposition that “First Amendment protections should&para;<br>apply with less force on college campuses than in the&para;<br>community at large.” 408 U. S., at 180. And on one key&para;<br>question after another—whether the local SDS chapter&para;<br>was independent of the national organization, whether the&para;<br>group posed a substantial threat of material disruption,&para;<br>and whether the students’ responses to the committee’s&para;<br>questions about violence and disruption signified a will&para;<br>ingness to engage in such activities—the Court drew&para;<br>its own conclusions, which differed from the college&para;<br>president’s.&para;<br>The Healy Court was true to the principle that when it&para;<br>comes to the interpretation and application of the right to&para;<br>free speech, we exercise our own independent judgment.&para;<br>We do not defer to Congress on such matters, see Sable&para;<br>Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 129&para;<br>(1989), and there is no reason why we should bow to uni&para;<br>versity administrators.&para;<br>In the end, I see only two possible distinctions between&para;<br>Healy and the present case. The first is that Healy did not&para;<br>involve any funding, but as I have noted, funding plays&para;<br>only a small part in this case. And if Healy would other&para;<br>wise prevent Hastings from refusing to register CLS, I see&para;<br>no good reason why the potential availability of funding&para;<br>should enable Hastings to deny all of the other rights that&para;<br>go with registration.&para;<br>This leaves just one way of distinguishing Healy: the&para;<br>identity of the student group. In Healy, the Court warned&para;<br>that the college president’s views regarding the philosophy&para;<br>of the SDS could not “justify the denial of First Amend&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ment rights.” 408 U. S., at 187. Here, too, disapproval of&para;<br>CLS cannot justify Hastings’ actions.2&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Court pays little attention to Healy and instead&para;<br>focuses solely on the question whether Hastings’ registra&para;<br>tion policy represents a permissible regulation in a limited&para;<br>public forum. While I think that Healy is largely control&para;<br>ling, I am content to address the constitutionality of Hast&para;<br>ings’ actions under our limited public forum cases, which&para;<br>lead to exactly the same conclusion.&para;<br>In this case, the forum consists of the RSO program.&para;<br>Once a public university opens a limited public forum, it&para;<br>“must respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.”&para;<br>Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515&para;<br>U. S. 819, 829 (1995). The university “may not exclude&para;<br>speech where its distinction is not ‘reasonable in light of&para;<br>the purpose served by the forum.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Corne&para;<br>lius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S.&para;<br>788, 806 (1985)). And the university must maintain strict&para;<br>viewpoint neutrality. Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis.&para;<br>System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, 234 (2000); Rosen&para;<br>berger, supra, at 829.&para;<br>This requirement of viewpoint neutrality extends to the&para;<br>expression of religious viewpoints. In an unbroken line of&para;<br>decisions analyzing private religious speech in limited&para;<br>public forums, we have made it perfectly clear that&para;<br>“[r]eligion is [a] viewpoint from which ideas are conveyed.”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The Court attempts to distinguish Healy on the ground that there&para;<br>the college “explicitly denied the student group official recognition&para;<br>because of the group’s viewpoint.” Ante, at 17, n. 15. The same, how&para;<br>ever, is true here. CLS was denied recognition under the Nondiscrimi&para;<br>nation Policy because of the viewpoint that CLS sought to express&para;<br>through its membership requirements.

We&para;<br>have also stressed that the rules applicable in a limited&para;<br>public forum are particularly important in the university&para;<br>setting, where “the State acts against a background of&para;<br>tradition of thought and experiment that is at the center&para;<br>of our intellectual and philosophic tradition.” Rosenberger,&para;<br>supra, at 835.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Analyzed under this framework, Hastings’ refusal to&para;<br>register CLS pursuant to its Nondiscrimination Policy&para;<br>plainly fails.3 As previously noted, when Hastings refused&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 CLS sought a declaratory judgment that this policy is unconstitu&para;<br>tional and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement. See App. 80.&para;<br>Particularly in light of Hastings’ practice of changing its announced&para;<br>policies, these requests are not moot. It is well settled that the volun&para;<br>tary cessation of allegedly unlawful conduct does not moot a case in&para;<br>which the legality of that conduct is challenged. See City of Mesquite v.&para;<br>Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283, 289 (1982); see also Allee v.&para;<br>Medrano, 416 U. S. 802, 810–811 (1974); DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416&para;<br>U.

As interpreted by Hastings and applied&para;<br>to CLS, both of these grounds constituted viewpoint&para;<br>discrimination.&para;<br>Religion. The First Amendment protects the right of&para;<br>“ ‘expressive association’ ”—that is, “the right to associate&para;<br>for the purpose of speaking.” Rumsfeld v. Forum for Aca&para;<br>demic and Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U. S. 47, 68&para;<br>(2006) (quoting Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U. S.&para;<br>640, 644 (2000)). And the Court has recognized that “[t]he&para;<br>forced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group in&para;<br>fringes the group’s freedom of expressive association if the&para;<br>presence of that person affects in a significant way the&para;<br>group’s ability to advocate public or private viewpoints.”&para;<br>Dale, supra, at 648.&para;<br>With one important exception, the Hastings Nondis&para;<br>crimination Policy respected that right. As Hastings&para;<br>stated in its answer, the Nondiscrimination Policy “per&para;<br>mit[ted] political, social, and cultural student organiza&para;<br>tions to select officers and members who are dedicated to a&para;<br>particular set of ideals or beliefs.” App. 93. But the policy&para;<br>singled out one category of expressive associations for&para;<br>disfavored treatment: groups formed to express a religious&para;<br>message. Only religious groups were required to admit&para;<br>students who did not share their views. An environmen&para;<br>talist group was not required to admit students who re&para;<br>——————&para;<br>discrimination Policy are not moot. If, as the Court assumes, the&para;<br>parties stipulated that the only relevant policy is the accept-all-comers&para;<br>policy, then the District Court should not have addressed the constitu&para;<br>tionality of the Nondiscrimination Policy. But the District Court&para;<br>approved both policies, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the judg&para;<br>ment. That judgment remains binding on CLS, so it is only appropriate&para;<br>that CLS be permitted to challenge that determination now. The&para;<br>question of the constitutionality of the Nondiscrimination Policy falls&para;<br>comfortably within the question presented, and CLS raised that issue&para;<br>in its brief.

An animal rights group was not&para;<br>obligated to accept students who supported the use of&para;<br>animals to test cosmetics. But CLS was required to admit&para;<br>avowed atheists. This was patent viewpoint discrimina&para;<br>tion. “By the very terms of the [Nondiscrimination Policy],&para;<br>the University . . . select[ed] for disfavored treatment&para;<br>those student [groups] with religious . . . viewpoints.”&para;<br>Rosenberger, 515 U.

It is no wonder that the&para;<br>Court makes no attempt to defend the constitutionality of&para;<br>the Nondiscrimination Policy.&para;<br>Unlike the Court, JUSTICE STEVENS attempts a defense,&para;<br>contending that the Nondiscrimination Policy is viewpoint&para;<br>neutral. But his arguments are squarely contrary to&para;<br>established precedent.&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS first argues that the Nondiscrimina&para;<br>tion Policy is viewpoint neutral because it “does not regu&para;<br>late expression or belief at all” but instead regulates con&para;<br>duct. See ante, at 2 (concurring opinion). This Court has&para;<br>held, however, that the particular conduct at issue here&para;<br>constitutes a form of expression that is protected by the&para;<br>First Amendment. It is now well established that the&para;<br>First Amendment shields the right of a group to engage in&para;<br>expressive association by limiting membership to persons&para;<br>whose admission does not significantly interfere with the&para;<br>group’s ability to convey its views. See Dale, supra, at&para;<br>648; Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 623&para;<br>(1984); see also New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of&para;<br>New York, 487 U.

Indeed, the opinion of the Court, which&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

See ante,&para;<br>at 13.&para;<br>JUSTICE STEVENS also maintains that the Nondiscrimi&para;<br>nation Policy is viewpoint neutral because it prohibits all&para;<br>groups, both religious and secular, from engaging in reli&para;<br>gious speech. See ante, at 3. This argument is also con&para;<br>trary to established law. In Rosenberger, the dissent,&para;<br>which JUSTICE STEVENS joined, made exactly this argu&para;<br>ment. See 515 U. S., at 895–896 (opinion of Souter, J.).&para;<br>The Court disagreed, holding that a policy that treated&para;<br>secular speech more favorably than religious speech dis&para;<br>criminated on the basis of viewpoint.4 515 U.

(For example, the Hastings Democratic Caucus&para;<br>and the Hastings Republicans were allowed to exclude&para;<br>members who disagreed with their parties’ platforms.)&para;<br>But religious groups were not permitted to express a&para;<br>religious viewpoint by limiting membership to students&para;<br>who shared their religious viewpoints. Under established&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 In Rosenberger the university argued that the denial of student&para;<br>activity funding for all groups that sought to express a religious view&para;<br>point was “facially neutral.” See Brief for Respondents in Rosenberger&para;<br>v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va., O. T. 1994, No. 94–329, p. 2; 515&para;<br>U. S., at 824–825. The Rosenberger dissenters agreed that the univer&para;<br>sity’s policy did not constitute viewpoint discrimination because “it&para;<br>applie[d] to Muslim and Jewish and Buddhist advocacy as well as to&para;<br>Christian,” and it “applie[d] to agnostics and atheists as well as it does&para;<br>to deists and theists.” Id., at 895–896 (opinion of Souter, J.); cf. ante, at&para;<br>2–3 (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (asserting that under Hastings’ Nondis&para;<br>crimination Policy “all acts of religious discrimination” are prohibited&para;<br>(emphasis added)). But the Court flatly rejected this argument. See&para;<br>515 U. S., at 831 (“Religion may be a vast area of inquiry, but it also&para;<br>provides, as it did here, a specific premise, a perspective, a standpoint&para;<br>from which a variety of subjects may be discussed and considered”).&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,&para;<br>HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>precedent, this was viewpoint discrimination.5&para;<br>It bears emphasis that permitting religious groups to&para;<br>limit membership to those who share the groups’ beliefs&para;<br>would not have the effect of allowing other groups to dis&para;<br>criminate on the basis of religion. It would not mean, for&para;<br>example, that fraternities or sororities could exclude stu&para;<br>dents on that basis. As our cases have recognized, the&para;<br>right of expressive association permits a group to exclude&para;<br>an applicant for membership only if the admission of that&para;<br>person would “affec[t] in a significant way the group’s&para;<br>ability to advocate public or private viewpoints.” Dale,&para;<br>530 U. S., at 648. Groups that do not engage in expressive&para;<br>association have no such right. Similarly, groups that are&para;<br>dedicated to expressing a viewpoint on a secular topic (for&para;<br>example, a political or ideological viewpoint) would have&para;<br>no basis for limiting membership based on religion be&para;<br>cause the presence of members with diverse religious&para;<br>beliefs would have no effect on the group’s ability to ex&para;<br>press its views. But for religious groups, the situation is&para;<br>very different. This point was put well by a coalition of&para;<br>Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and Sikh groups: “Of course&para;<br>there is a strong interest in prohibiting religious discrimi&para;<br>nation where religion is irrelevant.

The Hastings Nondiscrimination&para;<br>Policy, as interpreted by the law school, also discriminated&para;<br>on the basis of viewpoint regarding sexual morality. CLS&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 It is not at all clear what JUSTICE STEVENS means when he refers to&para;<br>religious “status” as opposed to religious belief. See ante, at 2, n. 1.&para;<br>But if by religious status he means such things as the religion into&para;<br>which a person was born or the religion of a person’s ancestors, then&para;<br>prohibiting discrimination on such grounds would not involve viewpoint&para;<br>discrimination.

S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>has a particular viewpoint on this subject, namely, that&para;<br>sexual conduct outside marriage between a man and a&para;<br>woman is wrongful. Hastings would not allow CLS to&para;<br>express this viewpoint by limiting membership to persons&para;<br>willing to express a sincere agreement with CLS’s views.&para;<br>By contrast, nothing in the Nondiscrimination Policy&para;<br>prohibited a group from expressing a contrary viewpoint&para;<br>by limiting membership to persons willing to endorse&para;<br>that group’s beliefs. A Free Love Club could require mem&para;<br>bers to affirm that they reject the traditional view of sex&para;<br>ual morality to which CLS adheres. It is hard to see&para;<br>how this can be viewed as anything other than viewpoint&para;<br>discrimination.&para;<br>V&para;<br>Hastings’ current policy, as announced for the first time&para;<br>in the brief filed in this Court, fares no better than the&para;<br>policy that the law school invoked when CLS’s application&para;<br>was denied. According to Hastings’ brief, its new policy,&para;<br>contrary to the position taken by Hastings officials at an&para;<br>earlier point in this litigation, really does not require a&para;<br>student group to accept all comers. Now, Hastings ex&para;<br>plains, its policy allows “neutral and generally applicable&para;<br>membership requirements unrelated to ‘status or beliefs.’ ”&para;<br>Brief for Respondent Hastings College of Law 5. As ex&para;<br>amples of permissible membership requirements, Hast&para;<br>ings mentions academic standing, writing ability, “dues,&para;<br>attendance, and even conduct requirements.” Ibid. (em&para;<br>phasis added).&para;<br>It seems doubtful that Hastings’ new policy permits&para;<br>registered groups to condition membership eligibility on&para;<br>whatever “conduct requirements” they may wish to im&para;<br>pose. If that is the school’s current policy, it is hard to see&para;<br>why CLS may not be registered, for what CLS demands is&para;<br>that members foreswear “unrepentant participation in or&para;<br>advocacy of a sexually immoral lifestyle.” App. 146.

MARTINEZ&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>should qualify as a conduct requirement.&para;<br>If it does not, then what Hastings’ new policy must&para;<br>mean is that registered groups may impose some, but not&para;<br>all, conduct requirements. And if that is the case, it is&para;<br>incumbent on Hastings to explain which conduct require&para;<br>ments are acceptable, which are not, and why CLS’s re&para;<br>quirement is not allowed. Hastings has made no effort to&para;<br>provide such an explanation.6&para;<br>VI&para;<br>I come now to the version of Hastings’ policy that the&para;<br>Court has chosen to address. This is not the policy that&para;<br>Hastings invoked when CLS was denied registration. Nor&para;<br>is it the policy that Hastings now proclaims—and pre&para;<br>sumably implements. It is a policy that, as far as the&para;<br>record establishes, was in force only from the time when it&para;<br>was first disclosed by the former dean in July 2005 until&para;<br>Hastings filed its brief in this Court in March 2010. Why&para;<br>we should train our attention on this particular policy and&para;<br>not the other two is a puzzle. But in any event, it is clear&para;<br>that the accept-all-comers policy is not reasonable in light&para;<br>of the purpose of the RSO forum, and it is impossible to&para;<br>say on the present record that it is viewpoint neutral.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Once a state university opens a limited forum, it “must&para;<br>respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.” Rosenber&para;<br>ger, 515 U. S., at 829. Hastings’ regulations on the regis&para;<br>tration of student groups impose only two substantive&para;<br>limitations: A group seeking registration must have stu&para;<br>dent members and must be non-commercial. App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 82a–83a, Hastings Board of Directors, Policies&para;<br>and Regulations Applying to College Activities, Organiza&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6Nor does the Court clarify this point. Suggesting that any conduct&para;<br>requirement must relate to “gross misconduct,” ante, at 4, n. 2, is not&para;<br>helpful.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tions and Students §34.10 (June 22, 1990) (hereinafter&para;<br>Hastings Regulations). Access to the forum is not limited&para;<br>to groups devoted to particular purposes. The regulations&para;<br>provide that a group applying for registration must submit&para;<br>an official document including “a statement of its purpose,”&para;<br>id., at 83a (Hastings Regulations §34.10.A.1 (emphasis&para;<br>added)), but the regulations make no attempt to define the&para;<br>limits of acceptable purposes. The regulations do not&para;<br>require a group seeking registration to show that it has a&para;<br>certain number of members or that its program is of inter&para;<br>est to any particular number of Hastings students. Nor do&para;<br>the regulations require that a group serve a need not met&para;<br>by existing groups.&para;<br>The regulations also make it clear that the registration&para;<br>program is not meant to stifle unpopular speech. They&para;<br>proclaim that “[i]t is the responsibility of the Dean to&para;<br>ensure an ongoing opportunity for the expression of a&para;<br>variety of viewpoints.” Id., at 82a (Hastings Regulations&para;<br>§33.11). They also emphatically disclaim any endorse&para;<br>ment of or responsibility for views that student groups&para;<br>may express. Id., at 85a (Hastings Regulations §34.10.D).&para;<br>Taken as a whole, the regulations plainly contemplate&para;<br>the creation of a forum within which Hastings students&para;<br>are free to form and obtain registration of essentially the&para;<br>same broad range of private groups that nonstudents may&para;<br>form off campus. That is precisely what the parties in this&para;<br>case stipulated: The RSO forum “seeks to promote a diver&para;<br>sity of viewpoints among registered student organizations,&para;<br>including viewpoints on religion and human sexuality.”&para;<br>App. 216 (emphasis added).&para;<br>The way in which the RSO forum actually developed&para;<br>corroborates this design. As noted, Hastings had more&para;<br>than 60 RSOs in 2004–2005, each with its own independ&para;<br>ently devised purpose. Some addressed serious social&para;<br>issues; others—for example, the wine appreciation and&para;<br>ultimate Frisbee clubs—were simply recreational.

The forum did not have a single Party Politics&para;<br>Club; rather, it featured both the Hastings Democratic&para;<br>Caucus and the Hastings Republicans. There was no&para;<br>Reproductive Issues Club; the forum included separate&para;<br>pro-choice and pro-life organizations. Students did not see&para;<br>fit to create a Monotheistic Religions Club, but they have&para;<br>formed the Hastings Jewish Law Students Association&para;<br>and the Hastings Association of Muslim Law Students. In&para;<br>short, the RSO forum, true to its design, has allowed&para;<br>Hastings students to replicate on campus a broad array of&para;<br>private, independent, noncommercial organizations that is&para;<br>very similar to those that nonstudents have formed in the&para;<br>outside world.&para;<br>The accept-all-comers policy is antithetical to the design&para;<br>of the RSO forum for the same reason that a state-imposed&para;<br>accept-all-comers policy would violate the First Amend&para;<br>ment rights of private groups if applied off campus. As&para;<br>explained above, a group’s First Amendment right of&para;<br>expressive association is burdened by the “forced inclu&para;<br>sion” of members whose presence would “affec[t] in a&para;<br>significant way the group’s ability to advocate public or&para;<br>private viewpoints.” Dale, 530 U. S., at 648. The Court&para;<br>has therefore held that the government may not compel a&para;<br>group that engages in “expressive association” to admit&para;<br>such a member unless the government has a compelling&para;<br>interest, “ ‘unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that&para;<br>cannot be achieved through means significantly less re&para;<br>strictive of associational freedoms.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Rob&para;<br>erts, 468 U. S., at 623).&para;<br>There can be no dispute that this standard would not&para;<br>permit a generally applicable law mandating that private&para;<br>religious groups admit members who do not share the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>27&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>groups’ beliefs. Religious groups like CLS obviously en&para;<br>gage in expressive association, and no legitimate state&para;<br>interest could override the powerful effect that an accept&para;<br>all-comers law would have on the ability of religious&para;<br>groups to express their views. The State of California&para;<br>surely could not demand that all Christian groups admit&para;<br>members who believe that Jesus was merely human.&para;<br>Jewish groups could not be required to admit anti-Semites&para;<br>and Holocaust deniers. Muslim groups could not be forced&para;<br>to admit persons who are viewed as slandering Islam.&para;<br>While there can be no question that the State of Califor&para;<br>nia could not impose such restrictions on all religious&para;<br>groups in the State, the Court now holds that Hastings, a&para;<br>state institution, may impose these very same require&para;<br>ments on students who wish to participate in a forum that&para;<br>is designed to foster the expression of diverse viewpoints.&para;<br>The Court lists four justifications offered by Hastings in&para;<br>defense of the accept-all-comers policy and, deferring to&para;<br>the school’s judgment, ante, at 21, the Court finds all those&para;<br>justifications satisfactory, ante, at 21–24. If we carry&para;<br>out our responsibility to exercise our own independent&para;<br>judgment, however, we must conclude that the justifica&para;<br>tions offered by Hastings and accepted by the Court are&para;<br>insufficient.&para;<br>The Court first says that the accept-all-comers policy is&para;<br>reasonable because it helps Hastings to ensure that “ ‘lead&para;<br>ership, educational, and social opportunities’ ” are afforded&para;<br>to all students. Ante, at 21–22 (quoting Brief for Respon&para;<br>dent Hastings College of Law 32). The RSO forum, how&para;<br>ever, is designed to achieve these laudable ends in a very&para;<br>different way—by permitting groups of students, no mat&para;<br>ter how small, to form the groups they want. In this way,&para;<br>the forum multiplies the opportunity for students to serve&para;<br>in leadership positions; it allows students to decide which&para;<br>educational opportunities they wish to pursue through&para;<br>participation in extracurricular activities; and it permits&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC.

It would be “a daunting labor,” the&para;<br>Court warns, for Hastings to try to determine whether&para;<br>a group excluded a member based on belief as opposed to&para;<br>status.

The long history of disputes about the&para;<br>meaning of Bible passages belies any suggestion that it&para;<br>would be an easy task to determine whether the grading of&para;<br>such a test was “objective.”&para;<br>Third, the Court argues that the accept-all-comers&para;<br>policy, by bringing together students with diverse views,&para;<br>encourages tolerance, cooperation, learning, and the de&para;<br>velopment of conflict-resolution skills. Ante, at 23. These&para;<br>are obviously commendable goals, but they are not un&para;<br>dermined by permitting a religious group to restrict mem&para;<br>bership to persons who share the group’s faith. Many&para;<br>religious groups impose such restrictions. See, e.g., Brief&para;<br>for Agudath Israel of America as Amicus Curiae 3&para;<br>(“[B]ased upon millennia-old Jewish laws and traditions,&para;<br>Orthodox Jewish institutions . . . regularly differentiate&para;<br>between Jews and non-Jews”). Such practices are not&para;<br>manifestations of “contempt” for members of other faiths.&para;<br>Cf. ante, at 6 (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (invoking groups&para;<br>that have “contempt for Jews, blacks, and women”). Nor&para;<br>do they thwart the objectives that Hastings endorses. Our&para;<br>country as a whole, no less than the Hastings College of&para;<br>Law, values tolerance, cooperation, learning, and the&para;<br>amicable resolution of conflicts. But we seek to achieve&para;<br>those goals through “[a] confident pluralism that conduces&para;<br>to civil peace and advances democratic consensus&para;<br>building,” not by abridging First Amendment rights. Brief&para;<br>for Gays and Lesbians for Individual Liberty as Amicus&para;<br>Curiae 35.&para;<br>Fourth, the Court observes that Hastings’ policy “incor&para;<br>porates—in fact, subsumes—state-law proscriptions on&para;<br>discrimination.” Ante, at 23. Because the First Amend&para;<br>ment obviously takes precedence over any state law, this&para;<br>&para;<br>30&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,&para;<br>HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW v. MARTINEZ&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>would not justify the Hastings policy even if it were true—&para;<br>but it is not. The only Hastings policy considered by the&para;<br>Court—the accept-all-comers policy—goes far beyond any&para;<br>California antidiscrimination law. Neither Hastings nor&para;<br>the Court claims that California law demands that state&para;<br>entities must accept all comers. Hastings itself certainly&para;<br>does not follow this policy in hiring or student admissions.&para;<br>Nor is it at all clear that California law requires Hast&para;<br>ings to deny registration to a religious group that limits&para;<br>membership to students who share the group’s religious&para;<br>beliefs. Hastings cites no California court decision or&para;<br>administrative authority addressing this question. In&para;<br>stead, Hastings points to a statute prohibiting discrimina&para;<br>tion on specified grounds, including religion or sexual&para;<br>orientation, “in any program or activity conducted by”&para;<br>certain postsecondary educational institutions. Cal. Educ.&para;<br>Code Ann. §66270 (West Supp. 2010) (emphasis added).&para;<br>Hastings, however, does not conduct the activities of the&para;<br>student groups it registers. Indeed, Hastings disclaims&para;<br>such responsibility, stating both in its regulations and its&para;<br>Handbook for Student Organizations that it “does not&para;<br>sponsor student organizations and therefore does not&para;<br>accept liability for activities of student organizations.”&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 85a (Hastings Regulations §34.10.D);&para;<br>App. 250. In addition, as CLS notes, another provision of&para;<br>California law specifically exempts “any funds that are&para;<br>used directly or indirectly for the benefit of student or&para;<br>ganizations” from a ban on state funding of private groups&para;<br>that discriminate on any of the grounds listed in §66270.&para;<br>See §92150 (West Supp. 2010).&para;<br>The authority to decide whether §66270 or any other&para;<br>provision of California law requires religious student&para;<br>groups at covered institutions to admit members who do&para;<br>not share the groups’ religious views is of course a ques&para;<br>tion of state law that we cannot resolve. The materials&para;<br>that have been brought to our attention, however, provide&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>31&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>little support for the majority’s suggested interpretation.&para;<br>In sum, Hastings’ accept-all-comers policy is not reason&para;<br>able in light of the stipulated purpose of the RSO forum: to&para;<br>promote a diversity of viewpoints “among”—not within—&para;<br>“registered student organizations.” App. 216 (emphasis&para;<br>added).9&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Court is also wrong in holding that the accept-all&para;<br>comers policy is viewpoint neutral. The Court proclaims&para;<br>that it would be “hard to imagine a more viewpoint&para;<br>neutral policy,” ante, at 28, but I would not be so quick to&para;<br>jump to this conclusion. Even if it is assumed that the&para;<br>policy is viewpoint neutral on its face,10 there is strong&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Although we have held that the sponsor of a limited public forum&para;<br>“must respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set,” Rosenberger, 515&para;<br>U. S., at 829, the Court now says that, if the exclusion of a group is&para;<br>challenged, the sponsor can retroactively redraw the boundary lines in&para;<br>order to justify the exclusion. See ante, at 21, n. 17. This approach&para;<br>does not respect our prior holding.&para;<br>10 In Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529&para;<br>U. S. 217 (2000), the Court considered a university rule permitting the&para;<br>“defund[ing]” of a registered student group through a student referen&para;<br>dum. See id., at 224–225. “To the extent the referendum substitutes&para;<br>majority determinations for viewpoint neutrality,” the Court observed,&para;<br>“it would undermine the constitutional protection the [university’s&para;<br>registered student organization] program requires.” Id., at 235. “The&para;<br>whole theory of viewpoint neutrality is that minority views are treated&para;<br>with the same respect as are majority views.” Ibid.&para;<br>Hastings’ accept-all-comers policy bears a resemblance to the South&para;<br>wark referendum process. Both permit the majority to silence a disfa&para;<br>vored organization. There is force to CLS’s argument that “[a]llowing&para;<br>all students to join and lead any group, even when they disagree with&para;<br>it, is tantamount to establishing a majoritarian heckler’s veto” and&para;<br>“potentially turn[s] every group into an organ for the already-dominant&para;<br>opinion.” Brief for Petitioner 51.&para;<br>The Court attempts to distinguish Southworth as involving a funding&para;<br>mechanism for student groups that operated selectively, based on&para;<br>groups’ viewpoints. Ante, at 29, n. 25. But that mechanism—a student&para;<br>referendum process—placed all students at risk of “being required to&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC.

See Crawford v. Board of Ed. of&para;<br>Los Angeles, 458 U. S. 527, 544 (1982) (“[A] law neutral on&para;<br>its face still may be unconstitutional if motivated by a&para;<br>discriminatory purpose”). A simple example illustrates&para;<br>this obvious point. Suppose that a hated student group at&para;<br>a state university has never been able to attract more than&para;<br>10 members. Suppose that the university administration,&para;<br>for the purpose of preventing that group from using the&para;<br>school grounds for meetings, adopts a new rule under&para;<br>which the use of its facilities is restricted to groups with&para;<br>more than 25 members. Although this rule would be&para;<br>neutral on its face, its adoption for a discriminatory reason&para;<br>would be illegal.&para;<br>Here, CLS has made a strong showing that Hastings’&para;<br>sudden adoption and selective application of its accept-all&para;<br>comers policy was a pretext for the law school’s unlawful&para;<br>denial of CLS’s registration application under the Nondis&para;<br>crimination Policy.&para;<br>Shifting policies. When Hastings denied CLS’s applica&para;<br>tion in the fall of 2004, the only policy mentioned was the&para;<br>Nondiscrimination Policy. In July 2005, the former dean&para;<br>suggested in a deposition that the law school actually&para;<br>followed the very different accept-all-comers policy. In&para;<br>March of this year, Hastings’ brief in this Court rolled out&para;<br>still a third policy. As is recognized in the employment&para;<br>discrimination context, where issues of pretext regularly&para;<br>arise, “[s]ubstantial changes over time in [an] employer’s&para;<br>——————&para;<br>pay fees which are subsidies for speech they find objectionable, even&para;<br>offensive,” solely upon a majority vote of the student body. See 529&para;<br>U. S., at 230, 235. That is no different in principle than an accept-all&para;<br>comers policy that places all student organizations at risk of take-over&para;<br>by a majority that is hostile to a group’s viewpoint.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Borg-Warner Automotive, Inc., 280 F. 3d&para;<br>579, 592 (CA6 2001).&para;<br>Timing. The timing of Hastings’ revelation of its new&para;<br>policies closely tracks the law school’s litigation posture.&para;<br>When Hastings denied CLS registration, it cited only the&para;<br>Nondiscrimination Policy. Later, after CLS alleged that&para;<br>the Nondiscrimination Policy discriminated against reli&para;<br>gious groups, Hastings unveiled its accept-all-comers&para;<br>policy. Then, after we granted certiorari and CLS’s open&para;<br>ing brief challenged the constitutionality—and the plausi&para;<br>bility—of the accept-all-comers policy, Hastings disclosed&para;<br>a new policy. As is true in the employment context,&para;<br>“[w]hen the justification for an adverse . . . action changes&para;<br>during litigation, that inconsistency raises an issue&para;<br>whether the proffered reason truly motivated the defen&para;<br>dant’s decision.” Cicero, supra, at 592.&para;<br>Lack of documentation. When an employer has a writ&para;<br>ten policy and then relies on a rule for which there is no&para;<br>written documentation, that deviation may support an&para;<br>inference of pretext. See, e.g., Diaz v. Eagle Produce Ltd.&para;<br>Partnership, 521 F. 3d 1201, 1214 (CA9 2008); Rudin v.&para;<br>Lincoln Land Community College, 420 F. 3d 712, 727 (CA7&para;<br>2005); Machinchick v.

Since it appears that no one was told&para;<br>about the accept-all-comers policy before July 2005, it is&para;<br>not surprising that the policy was not enforced. The re&para;<br>cord is replete with evidence that Hastings made no effort&para;<br>to enforce the all-comers policy until after it was pro&para;<br>claimed by the former dean. See, e.g., App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 118a (Hastings Democratic Caucus); id., at 110a&para;<br>(Association of Trial Lawyers of America at Hastings); id.,&para;<br>at 146a–147a (Vietnamese American Law Society); id., at&para;<br>142a–143a (Silent Right); App. 192 (La Raza). See gener&para;<br>ally supra, at 7–8. If the record here is not sufficient to&para;<br>permit a finding of pretext, then the law of pretext is dead.&para;<br>The Court—understandably—sidesteps this issue. The&para;<br>Court states that the lower courts did not address the&para;<br>“argument that Hastings selectively enforces its all-comer&para;<br>policy,”11 that “this Court is not the proper forum to air the&para;<br>issue in the first instance,” and that “[o]n remand, the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit may consider CLS’s pretext argument if,&para;<br>and to the extent, it is preserved.” Ante, at 31–32.&para;<br>Because the Court affirms the entry of summary judg&para;<br>ment in favor of respondents, it is not clear how CLS will&para;<br>be able to ask the Ninth Circuit on remand to review its&para;<br>claim of pretext. And the argument that we should not&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 As&para;<br>&para;<br>previously noted, CLS consistently argued in the courts below&para;<br>that Hastings had applied its registration policy in a discriminatory&para;<br>manner. See supra, at 9–10, n. 1. The Court would ignore these&para;<br>arguments because counsel for CLS acknowledged below that Hastings&para;<br>has an all-comers policy. See ante, at 9, n. 5 (quoting examples). But&para;<br>as the Court itself acknowledges, counsel for CLS stated at oral argu&para;<br>ment in this Court that “the Court needs to . . . reach the constitution&para;<br>ality of the all-comers policy as applied to CLS in this case.” Tr. of Oral&para;<br>Arg. 59 (emphasis added); ante, at 9, n. 5. And as the record shows,&para;<br>CLS has never ceded its argument that Hastings applies its accept-all&para;<br>comers policy unequally.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>35&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>address this issue of pretext because the Ninth Circuit did&para;<br>not do so is hard to take, given that the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>barely addressed anything, disposing of this case in pre&para;<br>cisely two sentences.&para;<br>Neither of those two sentences addressed the “novel&para;<br>question,” ante, at 1, to which the bulk of this Court’s&para;<br>opinion is devoted, i.e., whether the accept-all-comers&para;<br>policy is reasonable in light of the purposes of the RSO&para;<br>forum and is viewpoint neutral, see ante, at 17–31. If it is&para;<br>appropriate for us to consider that issue, then the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit’s failure to address the issue of pretext should not&para;<br>stand in the way of review by this Court.&para;<br>C&para;<br>One final aspect of the Court’s decision warrants com&para;<br>ment. In response to the argument that the accept-all&para;<br>comers-policy would permit a small and unpopular group&para;<br>to be taken over by students who wish to silence its mes&para;<br>sage, the Court states that the policy would permit a&para;<br>registered group to impose membership requirements&para;<br>“designed to ensure that students join because of their&para;<br>commitment to a group’s vitality, not its demise.” Ante, at&para;<br>27. With this concession, the Court tacitly recognizes that&para;<br>Hastings does not really have an accept-all-comers pol&para;<br>icy—it has an accept-some-dissident-comers policy—and&para;<br>the line between members who merely seek to change a&para;<br>group’s message (who apparently must be admitted) and&para;<br>those who seek a group’s “demise” (who may be kept out)&para;<br>is hopelessly vague.&para;<br>Here is an example. Not all Christian denominations&para;<br>agree with CLS’s views on sexual morality and other&para;<br>matters. During a recent year, CLS had seven members.&para;<br>Suppose that 10 students who are members of denomina&para;<br>tions that disagree with CLS decided that CLS was mis&para;<br>representing true Christian doctrine.

The new&para;<br>leadership would likely proclaim that the group was “vi&para;<br>tal” but rectified, while CLS, I assume, would take the&para;<br>view that the old group had suffered its “demise.”&para;<br>Whether a change represents reform or transformation&para;<br>may depend very much on the eye of the beholder.&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY takes a similarly mistaken tack. He&para;<br>contends that CLS “would have a substantial case on the&para;<br>merits if it were shown that the all-comers policy was . . .&para;<br>used to infiltrate the group or challenge its leadership in&para;<br>order to stifle its views,” ante, at 4 (concurring opinion),&para;<br>but he does not explain on what ground such a claim could&para;<br>succeed. The Court holds that the accept-all-comers policy&para;<br>is viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the pur&para;<br>poses of the RSO forum. How could those characteristics&para;<br>be altered by a change in the membership of one of the&para;<br>forum’s registered groups? No explanation is apparent.&para;<br>In the end, the Court refuses to acknowledge the conse&para;<br>quences of its holding. A true accept-all-comers policy&para;<br>permits small unpopular groups to be taken over by stu&para;<br>dents who wish to change the views that the group ex&para;<br>presses. Rules requiring that members attend meetings,&para;<br>pay dues, and behave politely, see ante, at 27, would not&para;<br>eliminate this threat.&para;<br>The possibility of such takeovers, however, is by no&para;<br>means the most important effect of the Court’s holding.&para;<br>There are religious groups that cannot in good conscience&para;<br>agree in their bylaws that they will admit persons who do&para;<br>not share their faith, and for these groups, the conse&para;<br>quence of an accept-all-comers policy is marginalization.&para;<br>See Brief for Evangelical Scholars (Officers and 24 Former&para;<br>Presidents of the Evangelical Theological Society) et al. as&para;<br>Amici Curiae 19 (affirmance in this case “will allow every&para;<br>public college and university in the United States to ex&para;<br>clude all evangelical Christian organizations”); Brief for&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.
