The Third Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: Petitioners’ state-law design-defect and failure-to-warn claims&para;<br>fall within the field of locomotive equipment regulation pre-empted&para;<br>by the LIA, as that field was defined in Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line&para;<br>R. Co., 272 U. S. 605. Pp. 2−11.&para;<br>(a) The LIA provides that a railroad carrier may use or allow to be&para;<br>used a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only when the locomotive or tender and its parts or appurtenances are in proper condition&para;<br>and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury,&para;<br>have been inspected as required by the LIA and regulations prescribed thereunder by the Secretary of Transportation, and can withstand every test prescribed under the LIA by the Secretary. See&para;<br>§20701. Pp. 2–3.&para;<br>(b) Congress may expressly pre-empt state law. But even without&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>an express pre-emption provision, state law must yield to a congressional Act to the extent of any conflict with a federal statute, see&para;<br>Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372, or&para;<br>when the federal statute’s scope indicates that Congress intended&para;<br>federal law to occupy a field exclusively, see Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514 U. S. 280, 287. This case involves only the latter, so-called&para;<br>“field pre-emption.” Pp. 3–4.&para;<br>(c) In Napier, this Court held two state laws prescribing the use of&para;<br>locomotive equipment pre-empted by the LIA, concluding that the&para;<br>broad power conferred by the LIA on the Interstate Commerce Commission (the agency then vested with authority to carry out the LIA’s&para;<br>requirements) was a “general one” that “extends to the design, the&para;<br>construction and the material of every part of the locomotive and&para;<br>tender and of all appurtenances.” 272 U. S., at 611. The Court rejected the States’ contention that the scope of the pre-empted field&para;<br>was to “be determined by the object sought through legislation, rather than the physical elements affected by it,” id., at 612, and found&para;<br>it dispositive that “[t]he federal and state statutes are directed to the&para;<br>same subject―the equipment of locomotives.” Ibid. Pp. 4−5.&para;<br>(d) The Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA) did not alter&para;<br>the LIA’s pre-emptive scope. By its terms, the FRSA—which instructs that “[t]he Secretary of Transportation . . . shall prescribe&para;<br>regulations and issue orders for every area of railroad safety supplementing laws and regulations in effect on October 16, 1970,” 49&para;<br>U. S. C. §20103(a)—does not alter pre-existing federal railroad safety&para;<br>statutes. Rather, it leaves those statutes intact and authorizes the&para;<br>Secretary to fill interstitial areas of railroad safety with supplemental regulation. Because the LIA was already in effect when the&para;<br>FRSA was enacted, the FRSA left the LIA, and its pre-emptive scope&para;<br>as defined by Napier, intact. P. 6.&para;<br>(e) Petitioners do not argue that Napier should be overruled. Instead, petitioners contend that their claims fall outside the LIA’s&para;<br>pre-empted field, as it was defined in Napier. Petitioners’ arguments&para;<br>are unpersuasive. First, the argument that the pre-empted field&para;<br>does not extend to state-law claims arising from the repair or&para;<br>maintenance of locomotives is inconsistent with Napier’s holding&para;<br>that Congress, in enacting the LIA, “manifest[ed] the intention to occupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment.” 272 U. S.,&para;<br>at 611. Second, the argument that petitioners’ failure-to-warn&para;<br>claims are not pre-empted because they do not base liability on the&para;<br>design or manufacture of a product ignores that a failure-to-warn&para;<br>claim alleges that the product itself is defective unless accompanied&para;<br>by sufficient warnings or instructions. Because petitioners’ failureto-warn claims are therefore directed at the equipment of locomo-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tives, they fall within the pre-empted field defined by Napier. Third,&para;<br>the argument that petitioners’ claims are not pre-empted because&para;<br>manufacturers were not regulated under the LIA when Corson was&para;<br>exposed to asbestos is inconsistent with Napier, which defined the&para;<br>pre-empted field on the basis of the physical elements regulated, not&para;<br>on the basis of the entity directly subject to regulation. Finally, contrary to petitioners’ argument, the LIA’s pre-emptive scope is not limited to state legislation or regulation but extends to state commonlaw duties and standards of care directed to the subject of locomotive&para;<br>equipment.

We&para;<br>agree.&para;<br>I&para;<br>George Corson was employed as a welder and machinist&para;<br>by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific Railroad&para;<br>from 1947 until 1974. Corson worked in locomotive repair&para;<br>and maintenance facilities, where his duties included&para;<br>installing brakeshoes on locomotives and stripping insula­&para;<br>tion from locomotive boilers. In 2005, Corson was diag­&para;<br>nosed with malignant mesothelioma.&para;<br>In 2007, Corson and his wife filed suit in Pennsylvania&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>state court against 59 defendants, including respondents&para;<br>Railroad Friction Products Corporation (RFPC) and Viad&para;<br>Corp (Viad). According to the complaint, RFPC distribut­&para;<br>ed locomotive brakeshoes containing asbestos, and Viad&para;<br>was the successor-in-interest to a company that manufac­&para;<br>tured and sold locomotives and locomotive engine valves&para;<br>containing asbestos. Corson alleged that he handled this&para;<br>equipment and that he was injured by exposure to asbes­&para;<br>tos. The complaint asserted state-law claims that the&para;<br>equipment was defectively designed because it contained&para;<br>asbestos, and that respondents failed to warn of the dan­&para;<br>gers of asbestos or to provide instructions regarding its&para;<br>safe use. After the complaint was filed, Corson passed&para;<br>away, and the executrix of his estate, Gloria Kurns, was&para;<br>substituted as a party. Corson’s widow and the executrix&para;<br>are petitioners here.&para;<br>Respondents removed the case to the United States&para;<br>District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania&para;<br>and moved for summary judgment. Respondents argued&para;<br>that petitioners’ state-law claims were pre-empted by the&para;<br>LIA. The District Court agreed and granted summary&para;<br>judgment for respondents. See Kurns v. A. W.

S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Congress enacted the predecessor to the LIA, the Boiler&para;<br>Inspection Act (BIA), in 1911. The BIA made it unlawful&para;<br>to use a steam locomotive “unless the boiler of said loco­&para;<br>motive and appurtenances thereof are in proper condition&para;<br>and safe to operate . . . without unnecessary peril to life or&para;<br>limb.” Act of Feb. 17, 1911, ch. 103, §2, 36 Stat. 913–914.&para;<br>In 1915, Congress amended the BIA to apply to “the entire&para;<br>locomotive and tender and all parts and appurtenances&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>thereof.”1 Act of Mar. 4, 1915, ch. 169, §1, 38 Stat. 1192.&para;<br>The BIA as amended became commonly known as the&para;<br>Locomotive Inspection Act. As relevant here, the LIA&para;<br>provides:&para;<br>“A railroad carrier may use or allow to be used&para;<br>a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only&para;<br>when the locomotive or tender and its parts and&para;<br>appurtenances—&para;<br>“(1) are in proper condition and safe to operate&para;<br>without unnecessary danger of personal injury;&para;<br>“(2) have been inspected as required under this&para;<br>chapter and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of&para;<br>Transportation under this chapter; and&para;<br>“(3) can withstand every test prescribed by the Sec­&para;<br>retary under this chapter.” 49 U. S. C. §20701.2&para;<br>The issue presented in this case is whether the LIA pre­&para;<br>empts petitioners’ state-law claims that respondents&para;<br>defectively designed locomotive parts and failed to warn&para;<br>Corson of dangers associated with those parts. In light of&para;<br>this Court’s prior decision in Napier, supra, we conclude&para;<br>that petitioners’ claims are pre-empted.&para;<br>III&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Supremacy Clause provides that federal law “shall&para;<br>be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the&para;<br>Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary not­&para;<br>withstanding.” U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. Pre-emption of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 A “tender” is a “[a] car attached to a locomotive, for carrying a sup­&para;<br>ply of fuel and water.” Webster’s New International Dictionary of the&para;<br>English Language 2126 (1917).&para;<br>2 At the time of Corson’s employment, this provision of the LIA was&para;<br>worded somewhat differently. See 45 U. S. C. §23 (1946 ed.). Petition­&para;<br>ers do not argue that the change in statutory language makes any&para;<br>difference in this case.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>state law thus occurs through the “direct operation of the&para;<br>Supremacy Clause.” Brown v. Hotel Employees, 468 U. S.&para;<br>491, 501 (1984). Congress may, of course, expressly pre­&para;<br>empt state law, but “[e]ven without an express provision&para;<br>for preemption, we have found that state law must yield to&para;<br>a congressional Act in at least two circumstances.” Crosby&para;<br>v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372&para;<br>(2000). First, “state law is naturally preempted to the&para;<br>extent of any conflict with a federal statute.” Ibid. Se­&para;<br>cond, we have deemed state law pre-empted “when the&para;<br>scope of a [federal] statute indicates that Congress intend­&para;<br>ed federal law to occupy a field exclusively.” Freightliner&para;<br>Corp. v. Myrick, 514 U. S. 280, 287 (1995). We deal here&para;<br>only with the latter, so-called field pre-emption.&para;<br>B&para;<br>We do not, however, address the LIA’s pre-emptive effect on a clean slate, because this Court addressed that&para;<br>issue 85 years ago in Napier. In that case, railroads chal­&para;<br>lenged two state laws that “prohibit[ed] use within the&para;<br>State of locomotives not equipped with” certain prescribed&para;<br>devices, on the ground that the Interstate Commerce&para;<br>Commission (ICC), the agency then vested with the au­&para;<br>thority to carry out the LIA’s requirements, had not re­&para;<br>quired the devices in question.3 272 U. S., at 607, 609. In&para;<br>response, the States argued that their requirements were&para;<br>not pre-empted because they were directed at a different&para;<br>objective than the LIA. Id., at 612. According to the&para;<br>States, their regulations were intended to protect railroad&para;<br>workers from sickness and disease, whereas “the federal&para;<br>regulation endeavors solely to prevent accidental injury in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Act&para;<br>&para;<br>of Feb. 17, 1911, §6, 36 Stat. 915. That authority has since&para;<br>been transferred to the Secretary of Transportation. Department of&para;<br>Transportation Act, §§6(e)(1)(E) and (F), 80 Stat. 939; see 49 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§20701–20702.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the operation of trains.” Ibid.&para;<br>To determine whether the state requirements were pre­&para;<br>empted, this Court asked whether the LIA “manifest[s]&para;<br>the intention to occupy the entire field of regulating loco­&para;<br>motive equipment[.]” Id., at 611. The Court answered&para;<br>that question in the affirmative, stating that “[t]he broad&para;<br>scope of the authority conferred upon the [ICC]” by Con­&para;<br>gress in the LIA led to that conclusion. Id., at 613. The&para;<br>power delegated to the ICC, the Court explained, was a&para;<br>“general one” that “extends to the design, the construction&para;<br>and the material of every part of the locomotive and ten­&para;<br>der and of all appurtenances.” Id., at 611.&para;<br>The Court rejected the States’ contention that the scope&para;<br>of the pre-empted field was to “be determined by the object&para;<br>sought through the legislation, rather than the physical&para;<br>elements affected by it.” Id., at 612. The Court found it&para;<br>dispositive that “[t]he federal and the state statutes are&para;<br>directed to the same subject—the equipment of locomo­&para;<br>tives.” Ibid. Because the States’ requirements operated&para;<br>upon the same physical elements as the LIA, the Court&para;<br>held that the state laws, “however commendable or how­&para;<br>ever different their purpose,” id., at 613, fell within the&para;<br>LIA’s pre-empted field.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Against the backdrop of Napier, petitioners advance two&para;<br>arguments in support of their position that their state-law&para;<br>claims related to the use of asbestos in locomotive equip­&para;<br>ment do not fall within the LIA’s pre-empted field. Peti­&para;<br>tioners first contend that Napier no longer defines the&para;<br>scope of the LIA’s pre-empted field because that field has&para;<br>been narrowed by a subsequently enacted federal statute.&para;<br>Alternatively, petitioners argue that their claims do not&para;<br>fall within the LIA’s pre-empted field, even as that field&para;<br>was defined by Napier. We address each of petitioners’&para;<br>arguments in turn.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>First, petitioners suggest that the Federal Railroad&para;<br>Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA), 84 Stat. 971 (codified at 49&para;<br>U. S. C. §20102 et seq.), altered the LIA’s pre-emptive&para;<br>scope. The FRSA grants the Secretary of Transportation&para;<br>broad regulatory authority over railroad safety. See&para;<br>§20103(a). Petitioners point to the FRSA’s pre-emption&para;<br>provision, which provides in part that “[a] State may adopt&para;<br>or continue in force a law, regulation, or order related to&para;<br>railroad safety . . . until the Secretary of Transportation&para;<br>. . . prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the&para;<br>subject matter of the State requirement.” §20106(a)(2)&para;<br>(2006 ed., Supp. III). According to petitioners, the FRSA’s&para;<br>pre-emption provision supplanted the LIA’s pre-emption of&para;<br>the field, with the result that petitioners’ claims are not&para;<br>pre-empted because the Secretary has not issued a regula­&para;<br>tion or order addressing the use of asbestos in locomotives&para;<br>or locomotive parts.&para;<br>Petitioners’ reliance on the FRSA is misplaced. The&para;<br>FRSA instructs that “[t]he Secretary of Transportation,&para;<br>as necessary, shall prescribe regulations and issue orders&para;<br>for every area of railroad safety supplementing laws and&para;<br>regulations in effect on October 16, 1970.” §20103(a) (2006&para;<br>ed.) (emphasis added). By its terms, the FRSA does&para;<br>not alter pre-existing federal statutes on railroad safety.&para;<br>“Rather, it leaves existing statutes intact, . . . and author­&para;<br>izes the Secretary to fill interstitial areas of railroad safety&para;<br>with supplemental regulation.” Marshall v. Burlington&para;<br>Northern, Inc., 720 F. 2d 1149, 1152–1153 (CA9 1983)&para;<br>(Kennedy, J.). Because the LIA was already in effect&para;<br>when the FRSA was enacted, we conclude that the FRSA&para;<br>left the LIA, and its pre-emptive scope as defined by Napier, intact.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Since the LIA’s pre-emptive scope remains unaltered,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>petitioners must contend with Napier. Petitioners do not&para;<br>ask us to overrule Napier and thus do not seek to over­&para;<br>come the presumption of stare decisis that attaches to this&para;<br>85-year-old precedent. See Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v.&para;<br>SEB S. A., 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9) (noting&para;<br>the “special force of the doctrine of stare decisis with re­&para;<br>gard to questions of statutory interpretation” (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted)). Instead, petitioners advance&para;<br>several arguments aimed at demonstrating that their&para;<br>claims fall outside of the field pre-empted by the LIA, as it&para;<br>was defined in Napier. Each is unpersuasive.&para;<br>1&para;<br>Petitioners, along with the Solicitor General as amicus&para;<br>curiae, first argue that petitioners’ claims do not fall with­&para;<br>in the LIA’s pre-empted field because the claims arise out&para;<br>of the repair and maintenance of locomotives, rather than&para;<br>the use of locomotives on a railroad line. Specifically, they&para;<br>contend that the scope of the field pre-empted by the LIA&para;<br>is coextensive with the scope of the Federal Government’s&para;<br>regulatory authority under the LIA, which, they argue,&para;<br>does not extend to the regulation of hazards arising from&para;<br>the repair or maintenance of locomotives. Therefore, the&para;<br>argument goes, state-law claims arising from repair or&para;<br>maintenance—as opposed to claims arising from use on&para;<br>the line—do not fall within the pre-empted field.&para;<br>We reject this attempt to redefine the pre-empted field.&para;<br>In Napier, the Court held that Congress, in enacting the&para;<br>LIA, “manifest[ed] the intention to occupy the entire field&para;<br>of regulating locomotive equipment,” and the Court did&para;<br>not distinguish between hazards arising from repair and&para;<br>maintenance as opposed to those arising from use on the&para;<br>line. 272 U. S., at 611. The pre-empted field as defined&para;<br>by Napier plainly encompasses the claims at issue here.&para;<br>Petitioners’ common-law claims for defective design and&para;<br>failure to warn are aimed at the equipment of locomotives.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Because those claims “are directed to the same subject” as&para;<br>the LIA, Napier dictates that they fall within the pre­&para;<br>empted field. Id., at 612.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Petitioners further argue that, even if their design­&para;<br>defect claims are pre-empted, their failure-to-warn claims&para;<br>do not suffer the same fate. In their complaint, petitioners&para;<br>alleged in closely related claims (1) that respondents&para;<br>negligently failed to warn of the risks associated with&para;<br>asbestos and to provide instructions concerning safe­&para;<br>guards for working with asbestos; and (2) that the asbestoscontaining products were defective because respondents&para;<br>failed to give sufficient warnings or instructions con­&para;<br>cerning the “risks, dangers, and harm inherent in said&para;<br>asbestos products.” See App. 20–27 (¶¶7–10, 12), 42 (¶8);&para;<br>see also Brief for Petitioners 11. According to petitioners,&para;<br>these claims do not fall within the LIA’s pre-empted field&para;<br>because “[t]he basis of liability for failure to warn . . . is&para;<br>not the ‘design’ or ‘manufacture’ of a product,” but is in­&para;<br>stead “the failure to provide adequate warnings regarding&para;<br>the product’s risks.” Reply Brief for Petitioners 16.&para;<br>We disagree. A failure-to-warn claim alleges that the&para;<br>product itself is unlawfully dangerous unless accompanied&para;<br>by sufficient warnings or instructions.&para;<br>Restatement&para;<br>(Third) of Torts: Products Liability §2(c) (1997) (A failure­&para;<br>to-warn claim alleges that a product is defective “when the&para;<br>foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have&para;<br>been reduced or avoided by the provision of reasonable&para;<br>instructions or warnings by the seller or other distribu­&para;<br>tor, . . . and the omission of the instructions or warnings&para;<br>renders the product not reasonably safe”); see also id.,&para;<br>Comment l, at 33 (“Reasonable designs and instructions&para;<br>or warnings both play important roles in the production&para;<br>and distribution of reasonably safe products”).

Because petition­&para;<br>ers’ failure-to-warn claims are therefore directed at the&para;<br>equipment of locomotives, they fall within the pre-empted&para;<br>field defined by Napier. 272 U.

A failure-to-warn claim imposes liability on a particular design of&para;<br>locomotive equipment unless warnings deemed sufficient under state&para;<br>law are given. This duty to warn and the accompanying threat of&para;<br>liability will inevitably influence a manufacturer’s choice whether to&para;<br>use that particular design.

Because petition­&para;<br>ers’ claims are directed at the equipment of locomotives,&para;<br>they fall within the pre-empted field.&para;<br>Petitioners’ proposed rule is also contrary to common&para;<br>sense. Under petitioners’ approach, a State could not&para;<br>require railroads to equip their locomotives with parts&para;<br>meeting state-imposed specifications, but could require&para;<br>manufacturers of locomotive parts to produce only parts&para;<br>meeting those state-imposed specifications. We rejected a&para;<br>similar approach in an express pre-emption context in&para;<br>Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., 541 U. S. 246 (2004).

We observed, however,&para;<br>that “treating sales restrictions and purchase restrictions&para;<br>differently for pre-emption purposes would make no&para;<br>sense,” because the “manufacturer’s right to sell federally&para;<br>approved vehicles is meaningless in the absence of a pur­&para;<br>chaser’s right to buy them.” Id., at 255. Similarly, a&para;<br>railroad’s ability to equip its fleet of locomotives in compli­&para;<br>ance with federal standards is meaningless if manufactur­&para;<br>ers are not allowed to produce locomotives and locomotive&para;<br>parts that meet those standards.

The Napier Court concluded that Congress had “manifest[ed] the intention to occupy&para;<br>the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment,” based&para;<br>on nothing more than a statute granting regulatory authority over that subject matter to a federal agency. Id.,&para;<br>at 611. Under our more recent cases, Congress must do&para;<br>much more to oust all of state law from a field. See, e.g.,&para;<br>New York State Dept. of Social Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U. S.&para;<br>405, 415 (1973) (rejecting preemption even though Congress had enacted a “detailed” and “comprehensive” regulatory scheme). Viewed through the lens of modern&para;<br>preemption law, Napier is an anachronism.&para;<br>But Napier governs so long as Congress lets it—and&para;<br>that decision provides a straightforward way to determine&para;<br>whether state laws relating to locomotive equipment are&para;<br>preempted. According to Napier, the scope of the agency’s&para;<br>power under the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA) determines the boundaries of the preempted field. See 272&para;<br>U. S., at 611 (state regulations were preempted because&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KURNS v.

And under that test, none of&para;<br>the state-law claims at issue here can survive.&para;<br>All of us agree that the petitioners’ defective-design&para;<br>claims are preempted. Napier recognized the federal&para;<br>agency’s delegated authority over “the design, the construction and the material of every part of the locomotive.”&para;<br>272 U. S., at 611. In doing so, Napier did not distinguish&para;<br>between “hazards arising from repair and maintenance” of&para;<br>the parts and hazards stemming from their “use on the&para;<br>line.” Ante, at 7. The agency thus has authority to regulate the design of locomotive equipment—like the asbetoscontaining brakeshoes here—to prevent either danger.&para;<br>And that fact resolves the preemption question. Because&para;<br>the agency could have banned use of the brakeshoes as&para;<br>designed, the petitioners’ defective-design claims—which&para;<br>would effectively accomplish the identical result—fall&para;<br>within the preempted field.&para;<br>So too the petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims, and for&para;<br>the same reason. Napier did not specifically address&para;<br>warnings, because the case in no way involved them. But&para;<br>if an agency has the power to prohibit the use of locomotive equipment, it also has the power to condition the use&para;<br>of that equipment on proper warnings. (And that is so,&para;<br>contrary to JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s view, see post, at 8, n. 3,&para;<br>whether the warning is engraved into the part itself or&para;<br>posted on the workshop wall.) Here, for example, the&para;<br>agency need not have chosen between banning asbestoscontaining brakeshoes and leaving them entirely unregulated. It could instead have required a warning about how&para;<br>to handle those brakeshoes safely. If, say, a mask would&para;<br>have protected a worker from risk, then the agency could&para;<br>have demanded a notice to that effect. See, e.g., Law v.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

But that claim conflates two separate distinctions. The&para;<br>agency draws a line not between mandating design changes and mandating warnings, but between regulating equipment that is hazardous&para;<br>to repair and regulating equipment that is hazardous to use on the&para;<br>railroad line. In keeping with that analysis, the agency contends that&para;<br>the petitioners’ design-defect claims also fall outside the preempted&para;<br>field because the alleged defect in the brakeshoes rendered dangerous&para;<br>only their repair, and not their on-line use. See Brief for United States&para;<br>as Amicus Curiae 12–13. The agency’s understanding of its authority therefore does not support JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s position. As the&para;<br>agency agrees, the petitioners’ claims must stand or fall together if&para;<br>viewed through the lens of the agency’s regulatory authority. In my&para;<br>view, they fall because the Court rightly rejects the agency’s proffered&para;<br>distinction between regulating the dangers of repairing equipment and&para;<br>regulating the dangers of using that equipment on line.

In a fundamental&para;<br>sense, therefore, a failure-to-warn claim proceeds by tak­&para;<br>ing a product’s physical design as a given.

Rather, the&para;<br>“gravamen” of these claims is that petitioners’ decedent&para;<br>George Corson could have avoided the harmful conse­&para;<br>quences of exposure to asbestos while repairing precisely&para;<br>the same locomotive parts had respondents cautioned him,&para;<br>for example, to wear a mask.&para;<br>Finally, preserving petitioners’ failure-to-warn claims&para;<br>coheres with the LIA’s regulatory regime. Neither the&para;<br>Interstate Commerce Commission, to which Congress first&para;<br>delegated authority under the LIA, nor the Federal Rail­&para;<br>road Administration (FRA), to whom that authority now&para;<br>belongs, has ever regulated locomotive repair and mainte­&para;<br>nance. To the contrary, the FRA takes the position that it&para;<br>lacks power under the LIA to regulate within locomotive&para;<br>maintenance and repair facilities. Brief for United States&para;<br>as Amicus Curiae in John Crane, Inc. v. Atwell, O. T.&para;<br>2010, No. 10–272, p. 10 (“[T]he field covered by the LIA&para;<br>does not include requirements concerning the repair of&para;<br>locomotives that are not in use”); Brief for United States&para;<br>as Amicus Curiae 13 (“The preempted field . . . does not&para;<br>include tort claims based on injuries arising when locomo­&para;<br>tives are not in use”). The FRA has determined that the&para;<br>Occupational Safety and Health Administration, not itself,&para;<br>bears primary responsibility for workplace safety, includ­&para;<br>ing with respect to hazardous materials. 43 Fed. Reg.&para;<br>10583–10590 (1978); cf., e.g., English, 496 U. S., at 83, and&para;<br>n. 6. And the FRA has not promulgated regulations that&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>KURNS v. RAILROAD FRICTION PRODUCTS CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>address warnings specific to maintenance and repair.&para;<br>Because the pre-empted field is congruent with the regu­&para;<br>lated field, see, e.g., United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89,&para;<br>112 (2000), the majority’s decision sweeps far too broadly.3&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>In short, the majority affords the LIA field-pre-emptive&para;<br>effect well beyond what Napier requires, leaving petition­&para;<br>ers without a remedy for what they allege was fatal ex­&para;<br>posure to asbestos in repair facilities. “It is difficult to&para;<br>believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all&para;<br>means of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal&para;<br>conduct.” Silkwood, 464 U. S., at 251. That is doubly true&para;<br>in light of the LIA’s “purpose . . . of facilitating employee&para;<br>recovery, not of restricting such recovery or making it&para;<br>impossible.” Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 189 (1949).&para;<br>I therefore concur in part and dissent in part.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Disagreeing with the agency’s interpretation, JUSTICE KAGAN con­&para;<br>cludes that the LIA empowers the FRA to require warnings as an&para;<br>incident of the authority to prescribe locomotive design. Compare ante,&para;<br>2–3 (concurring opinion), with, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 22–23. Such power,&para;<br>if it exists, must be limited to warnings that impose direct require­&para;<br>ments on the physical composition of locomotive equipment. Cf. n. 1,&para;<br>supra; 49 CFR §§229.85, 229.113 (2010). That may be a formal line,&para;<br>but it is the line that this Court drew in describing the scope of the&para;<br>authority conferred by the LIA, and therefore the pre-empted field. See&para;<br>Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605, 611–612 (1926).&para;<br>And it is the line that separates petitioners’ design-defect claims from&para;<br>their claims for failure to warn.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
