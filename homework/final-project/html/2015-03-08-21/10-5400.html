UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–5400. Argued April 18, 2011—Decided June 16, 2011&para;<br>Petitioner Tapia was convicted of, inter alia, smuggling unauthorized&para;<br>aliens into the United States. The District Court imposed a 51&para;<br>month prison term, reasoning that Tapia should serve that long in&para;<br>order to qualify for and complete the Bureau of Prisons’ Residential&para;<br>Drug Abuse Program (RDAP). On appeal, Tapia argued that length&para;<br>ening her prison term to make her eligible for RDAP violated 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §3582(a), which instructs sentencing courts to “recogniz[e]&para;<br>that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correc&para;<br>tion and rehabilitation.” The Ninth Circuit disagreed. Relying on&para;<br>Circuit precedent, it held that a sentencing court cannot impose a&para;<br>prison term to assist a defendant’s rehabilitation, but once impris&para;<br>onment is chosen, the court may consider the defendant’s rehabilita&para;<br>tion needs in setting the sentence’s length.&para;<br>Held: Section 3582(a) does not permit a sentencing court to impose or&para;<br>lengthen a prison term in order to foster a defendant’s rehabilitation.&para;<br>Pp. 3–15.&para;<br>(a) For nearly a century, the Federal Government used an inde&para;<br>terminate sentencing system premised on faith in rehabilitation.&para;<br>Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 363. Because that system&para;<br>produced “serious disparities in [the] sentences” imposed on similarly&para;<br>situated defendants, id., at 365, and failed to “achieve rehabilitation,”&para;<br>id., at 366, Congress enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984&para;<br>(SRA), replacing the system with one in which Sentencing Guidelines&para;<br>would provide courts with “a range of determinate sentences,” id., at&para;<br>368. Under the SRA, a sentencing judge must impose at least im&para;<br>prisonment, probation, or a fine. See §3551(b). In determining the&para;<br>appropriate sentence, judges must consider retribution, deterrence,&para;<br>incapacitation, and rehabilitation, §3553(a)(2), but a particular pur&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TAPIA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>pose may apply differently, or not at all, depending on the kind of&para;<br>sentence under consideration. As relevant here, a court ordering im&para;<br>prisonment must “recogniz[e] that imprisonment is not an appropri&para;<br>ate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.” §3582(a). A&para;<br>similar provision instructs the Sentencing Commission, as the Sen&para;<br>tencing Guidelines’ author, to “insure that the guidelines reflect the&para;<br>inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment&para;<br>for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant.” 28 U. S. C. §994(k).&para;<br>Pp. 3–6.&para;<br>(b) Consideration of Tapia’s claim starts with §3582(a)’s clear text.&para;<br>Putting together the most natural definitions of “recognize”—“to ac&para;<br>knowledge or treat as valid”—and not “appropriate”—not “suitable or&para;<br>fitting for a particular purpose”—§3582(a) tells courts to acknowledge&para;<br>that imprisonment is not suitable for the purpose of promoting reha&para;<br>bilitation. It also instructs courts to make that acknowledgment&para;<br>when “determining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and&para;<br>. . . [when] determining the length of the term.” Amicus, appointed to&para;<br>defend the judgment below, argues that the “recognizing” clause is&para;<br>merely a caution for judges not to put too much faith in the capacity&para;<br>of prisons to rehabilitate. But his alternative interpretation is un&para;<br>persuasive, as Congress expressed itself clearly in §3582(a). Amicus&para;<br>also errs in echoing the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning that §3582’s term&para;<br>“imprisonment” relates to the decision whether to incarcerate, not the&para;<br>determination of the sentence’s length. Because “imprisonment”&para;<br>most naturally means “the state of being confined” or “a period of con&para;<br>finement,” it does not distinguish between the defendant’s initial&para;<br>placement behind bars and his continued stay there.&para;<br>Section 3582(a)’s context supports this textual conclusion. By re&para;<br>stating §3582(a)’s message to the Sentencing Commission, Congress&para;<br>ensured that all sentencing officials would work in tandem to imple&para;<br>ment the statutory determination to “reject imprisonment as a means&para;<br>of promoting rehabilitation.” Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 367. Equally il&para;<br>luminating is the absence of any provision authorizing courts to en&para;<br>sure that offenders participate in prison rehabilitation programs.&para;<br>When Congress wanted sentencing courts to take account of rehabili&para;<br>tative needs, it gave them authority to do so. See, e.g., §3563(b)(9).&para;<br>In fact, although a sentencing court can recommend that an offender&para;<br>be placed in a particular facility or program, see §3582(a), the author&para;<br>ity to make the placement rests with the Bureau of Prisons, see, e.g.,&para;<br>§3621(e). The point is well illustrated here, where the District&para;<br>Court’s strong recommendations that Tapia participate in RDAP and&para;<br>be placed in a particular facility went unfulfilled. Finally, for those&para;<br>who consider legislative history useful, the key Senate Report on the&para;<br>SRA provides corroborating evidence. Pp. 6–12.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

A&para;<br>court does not err by discussing the opportunities for rehabilitation&para;<br>within prison or the benefits of specific treatment or training pro&para;<br>grams. But the record indicates that the District Court may have in&para;<br>creased the length of Tapia’s sentence to ensure her completion of&para;<br>RDAP, something a court may not do.

We hold that it does.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Petitioner Alejandra Tapia was convicted of, inter alia,&para;<br>smuggling unauthorized aliens into the United States, in&para;<br>violation of 8 U. S. C. §§1324(a)(2)(B)(ii) and (iii). At sen&para;<br>tencing, the District Court determined that the United&para;<br>States Sentencing Guidelines recommended a prison term&para;<br>of between 41 and 51 months for Tapia’s offenses. The&para;<br>court decided to impose a 51-month term, followed by&para;<br>three years of supervised release. In explaining its rea&para;<br>sons, the court referred several times to Tapia’s need for&para;<br>drug treatment, citing in particular the Bureau of Prison’s&para;<br>Residential Drug Abuse Program (known as RDAP or the&para;<br>500 Hour Drug Program). The court indicated that Tapia&para;<br>should serve a prison term long enough to qualify for and&para;<br>complete that program:&para;<br>“The sentence has to be sufficient to provide needed&para;<br>correctional treatment, and here I think the needed&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TAPIA v.

Tapia&para;<br>did not object to the sentence at that time. Id., at 31.&para;<br>On appeal, however, Tapia argued that the District&para;<br>Court had erred in lengthening her prison term to make&para;<br>her eligible for RDAP. App. to Pet. for Cert. 2. In Tapia’s&para;<br>view, this action violated 18 U. S. C. §3582(a), which&para;<br>instructs sentencing courts to “recogniz[e] that imprison&para;<br>ment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction&para;<br>and rehabilitation.” The United States Court of Appeals&para;<br>for the Ninth Circuit disagreed, 376 Fed. Appx. 707 (2010),&para;<br>relying on its prior decision in United States v. Duran, 37&para;<br>F. 3d 557 (1994). The Ninth Circuit had held there that&para;<br>§3582(a) distinguishes between deciding to impose a term&para;<br>of imprisonment and determining its length. See id., at&para;<br>561. According to Duran, a sentencing court cannot im&para;<br>pose a prison term to assist a defendant’s rehabilitation.&para;<br>But “[o]nce imprisonment is chosen as a punishment,” the&para;<br>court may consider the defendant’s need for rehabilitation&para;<br>in setting the length of the sentence. Ibid.&para;<br>We granted certiorari to consider whether §3582(a)&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>permits a sentencing court to impose or lengthen a prison&para;<br>term in order to foster a defendant’s rehabilitation. 562&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2010). That question has divided the Courts of&para;<br>Appeals.1 Because the United States agrees with Tapia’s&para;<br>interpretation of the statute, we appointed an amicus&para;<br>curiae to defend the judgment below.2 We now reverse.&para;<br>II&para;<br>We begin with statutory background—how the relevant&para;<br>sentencing provisions came about and what they say.&para;<br>Aficionados of our sentencing decisions will recognize&para;<br>much of the story line.&para;<br>“For almost a century, the Federal Government em&para;<br>ployed in criminal cases a system of indeterminate sen&para;<br>tencing.” Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 363&para;<br>(1989). Within “customarily wide” outer boundaries set by&para;<br>Congress, trial judges exercised “almost unfettered discre&para;<br>tion” to select prison sentences for federal offenders. Id.,&para;<br>at 364. In the usual case, a judge also could reject prison&para;<br>time altogether, by imposing a “suspended” sentence. If&para;<br>the judge decided to impose a prison term, discretionary&para;<br>authority shifted to parole officials: Once the defendant&para;<br>had spent a third of his term behind bars, they could order&para;<br>his release. See K. Stith &amp; J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging:&para;<br>Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 18–20 (1998).&para;<br>This system was premised on a faith in rehabilitation.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Three&para;<br>&para;<br>Circuits have held that §3582(a) allows a court to lengthen,&para;<br>although not to impose, a prison term based on the need for rehabilita&para;<br>tion. See United States v. Duran, 37 F. 3d 557 (CA9 1994); United&para;<br>States v. Hawk Wing, 433 F. 3d 622 (CA8 2006); United States v.&para;<br>Jimenez, 605 F. 3d 415 (CA6 2010). Two Courts of Appeals have ruled&para;<br>that §3582(a) bars a court from either imposing or increasing a period&para;<br>of confinement for rehabilitative reasons. See United States v. Man&para;<br>zella, 475 F. 3d 152 (CA3 2007); In re Sealed Case, 573 F. 3d 844&para;<br>(CADC 2009).&para;<br>2 We appointed Stephanos Bibas to brief and argue the case, 562 U. S.&para;<br>___ (2011), and he has ably discharged his responsibilities.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>TAPIA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Discretion allowed “the judge and the parole officer to&para;<br>[base] their respective sentencing and release decisions&para;<br>upon their own assessments of the offender’s amenability&para;<br>to rehabilitation.” Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 363. A convict,&para;<br>the theory went, should generally remain in prison only&para;<br>until he was able to reenter society safely. His release&para;<br>therefore often coincided with “the successful completion&para;<br>of certain vocational, educational, and counseling pro&para;<br>grams within the prisons.” S. Rep. No. 98–225, p. 40&para;<br>(1983) (hereinafter S. Rep.). At that point, parole officials&para;<br>could “determin[e] that [the] prisoner had become reha&para;<br>bilitated and should be released from confinement.” Stith&para;<br>&amp; Cabranes, supra, at 18.3&para;<br>But this model of indeterminate sentencing eventually&para;<br>fell into disfavor. One concern was that it produced “[s]eri&para;<br>ous disparities in [the] sentences” imposed on similarly situated defendants. Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 365.&para;<br>Another was that the system’s attempt to “achieve reha&para;<br>bilitation of offenders had failed.” Id., at 366. Lawmakers&para;<br>and others increasingly doubted that prison programs&para;<br>could “rehabilitate individuals on a routine basis”—or that&para;<br>parole officers could “determine accurately whether or&para;<br>when a particular prisoner ha[d] been rehabilitated.”&para;<br>S. Rep., at 40.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The statutes governing punishment of drug-addicted offenders (like&para;<br>Tapia) provide an example of this system at work. If a court concluded&para;<br>that such an offender was “likely to be rehabilitated through treat&para;<br>ment,” it could order confinement “for treatment . . . for an indetermi&para;<br>nate period of time” not to exceed the lesser of 10 years or the statutory&para;<br>maximum for the offender’s crime. 18 U. S. C. §4253(a) (1982 ed.); see&para;<br>also §4251(c) (“ ‘Treatment’ includes confinement and treatment in an&para;<br>institution . . . and includes, but is not limited to, medical, educational,&para;<br>social, psychological, and vocational services, corrective and preventive&para;<br>guidance and training, and other rehabilitative services”). Once the&para;<br>offender had undergone treatment for six months, the Attorney General&para;<br>could recommend that the Board of Parole release him from custody,&para;<br>and the Board could then order release “in its discretion.” §4254.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress accordingly enacted the Sentencing Reform&para;<br>Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987 (SRA or Act), to overhaul fed&para;<br>eral sentencing practices. The Act abandoned indetermi&para;<br>nate sentencing and parole in favor of a system in which&para;<br>Sentencing Guidelines, promulgated by a new Sentencing&para;<br>Commission, would provide courts with “a range of deter&para;<br>minate sentences for categories of offenses and defen&para;<br>dants.” Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 368. And the Act further&para;<br>channeled judges’ discretion by establishing a framework&para;<br>to govern their consideration and imposition of sentences.&para;<br>Under the SRA, a judge sentencing a federal offender&para;<br>must impose at least one of the following sanctions: im&para;<br>prisonment (often followed by supervised release), proba&para;<br>tion, or a fine. See §3551(b). In determining the appro&para;<br>priate sentence from among these options, §3553(a)(2)&para;<br>requires the judge to consider specified factors, including:&para;<br>“the need for the sentence imposed—&para;<br>“(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense,&para;<br>to promote respect for the law, and to pro&para;<br>vide just punishment for the offense;&para;<br>“(B) to afford adequate deterrence to crimi&para;<br>nal conduct;&para;<br>“(C) to protect the public from further&para;<br>crimes of the defendant; and&para;<br>“(D) to provide the defendant with needed&para;<br>educational or vocational training, medical&para;<br>care, or other correctional treatment in the&para;<br>most effective manner.”&para;<br>These four considerations—retribution, deterrence, inca&para;<br>pacitation, and rehabilitation—are the four purposes of&para;<br>sentencing generally, and a court must fashion a sentence&para;<br>“to achieve the[se] purposes . . . to the extent that they are&para;<br>applicable” in a given case. §3551(a).&para;<br>The SRA then provides additional guidance about how&para;<br>the considerations listed in §3553(a)(2) pertain to each of&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>TAPIA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the Act’s main sentencing options—imprisonment, super&para;<br>vised release, probation, and fines. See §3582(a); §3583;&para;<br>§3562(a); §3572(a). These provisions make clear that a&para;<br>particular purpose may apply differently, or even not at&para;<br>all, depending on the kind of sentence under considera&para;<br>tion. For example, a court may not take account of retri&para;<br>bution (the first purpose listed in §3553(a)(2)) when impos&para;<br>ing a term of supervised release. See §3583(c).&para;<br>Section 3582(a), the provision at issue here, specifies the&para;<br>“factors to be considered” when a court orders imprison&para;<br>ment. That section provides:&para;<br>“The court, in determining whether to impose a term&para;<br>of imprisonment, and, if a term of imprisonment is&para;<br>to be imposed, in determining the length of the term,&para;<br>shall consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a)&para;<br>to the extent that they are applicable, recognizing&para;<br>that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of&para;<br>promoting correction and rehabilitation.”&para;<br>A similar provision addresses the Sentencing Commission&para;<br>in its capacity as author of the Sentencing Guidelines.&para;<br>The SRA instructs the Commission to:&para;<br>“insure that the guidelines reflect the inappropriate&para;<br>ness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment&para;<br>for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant or pro&para;<br>viding the defendant with needed educational or voca&para;<br>tional training, medical care, or other correctional&para;<br>treatment.” 28 U. S. C. §994(k).&para;<br>With this statutory background established, we turn to&para;<br>the matter of interpretation.&para;<br>III&para;<br>A&para;<br>Our consideration of Tapia’s claim starts with the text of&para;<br>18 U. S. C. §3582(a)—and given the clarity of that provi-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sion’s language, could end there as well. As just noted,&para;<br>that section instructs courts to “recogniz[e] that impris&para;<br>onment is not an appropriate means of promoting correc&para;<br>tion and rehabilitation.” A common—and in context the&para;<br>most natural—definition of the word “recognize” is “to ac&para;<br>knowledge or treat as valid.” Random House Dictionary of&para;<br>the English Language 1611 (2d ed. 1987). And a thing&para;<br>that is not “appropriate” is not “suitable or fitting for a&para;<br>particular purpose.” Id., at 103. Putting these two defini&para;<br>tions together, §3582(a) tells courts that they should ac&para;<br>knowledge that imprisonment is not suitable for the pur&para;<br>pose of promoting rehabilitation. And when should courts&para;<br>acknowledge this? Section §3582(a) answers: when “de&para;<br>termining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and,&para;<br>if a term of imprisonment is to be imposed, [when] deter&para;<br>mining the length of the term.” So a court making these&para;<br>decisions should consider the specified rationales of&para;<br>punishment except for rehabilitation, which it should ac&para;<br>knowledge as an unsuitable justification for a prison term.&para;<br>As against this understanding, amicus argues that&para;<br>§3582(a)’s “recognizing” clause is not a flat prohibition&para;<br>but only a “reminder” or a “guide [for] sentencing judges’&para;<br>cognitive processes.” Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus&para;<br>Curiae in Support of Judgment Below 23–24 (hereinafter&para;<br>Amicus Brief) (emphasis deleted). Amicus supports this&para;<br>view by offering a string of other definitions of the&para;<br>word “recognize”: “ ‘recall to mind,’ ‘realize,’ or ‘perceive&para;<br>clearly.’ ” Id., at 24 (quoting dictionary definitions). Once&para;<br>these are plugged in, amicus suggests, §3582(a) reveals&para;<br>itself as a kind of loosey-goosey caution not to put too&para;<br>much faith in the capacity of prisons to rehabilitate.&para;<br>But we do not see how these alternative meanings of&para;<br>“recognize” help amicus’s cause. A judge who “perceives&para;<br>clearly” that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of&para;<br>promoting rehabilitation would hardly incarcerate some&para;<br>one for that purpose. Ditto for a judge who “realizes” or&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>TAPIA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“recalls” that imprisonment is not a way to rehabilitate an&para;<br>offender. To be sure, the drafters of the “recognizing”&para;<br>clause could have used still more commanding language:&para;<br>Congress could have inserted a “thou shalt not” or equiva&para;<br>lent phrase to convey that a sentencing judge may never,&para;<br>ever, under any circumstances consider rehabilitation in&para;<br>imposing a prison term. But when we interpret a statute,&para;<br>we cannot allow the perfect to be the enemy of the merely&para;<br>excellent. Congress expressed itself clearly in §3582(a),&para;<br>even if armchair legislators might come up with some&para;<br>thing even better. And what Congress said was that when&para;<br>sentencing an offender to prison, the court shall consider&para;<br>all the purposes of punishment except rehabilitation—&para;<br>because imprisonment is not an appropriate means of&para;<br>pursuing that goal.&para;<br>Amicus also claims, echoing the Ninth Circuit’s reason&para;<br>ing in Duran, that §3582(a)’s “recognizing” clause bars&para;<br>courts from considering rehabilitation only when imposing&para;<br>a prison term, and not when deciding on its length. The&para;<br>argument goes as follows. Section 3582(a) refers to two&para;<br>decisions: “The court, [1] in determining whether to im&para;<br>pose a term of imprisonment, and, if a term of imprison&para;<br>ment is to be imposed, [2] in determining the length of the&para;<br>term” must consider the purposes of punishment listed&para;<br>in §3553(a)(2), subject to the caveat of the “recognizing”&para;<br>clause. But that clause says only that “imprisonment” is&para;<br>not an appropriate means of rehabilitation. Because the&para;<br>“primary meaning of ‘imprisonment’ is ‘the act of confining&para;<br>a person,’ ” amicus argues, the clause relates only to&para;<br>[1] the decision to incarcerate, and not to [2] the separate&para;<br>determination of the sentence’s length. Amicus Brief 52.&para;<br>We again disagree. Under standard rules of grammar,&para;<br>§3582(a) says: A sentencing judge shall recognize that&para;<br>imprisonment is not appropriate to promote rehabilita&para;<br>tion when the court considers the applicable factors of&para;<br>§3553(a)(2); and a court considers these factors when&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>determining both whether to imprison an offender and&para;<br>what length of term to give him.&para;<br>The use of the&para;<br>word “imprisonment” in the “recognizing” clause does not&para;<br>destroy—but instead fits neatly into—this construction.&para;<br>“Imprisonment” as used in the clause most naturally&para;<br>means “[t]he state of being confined” or “a period of con&para;<br>finement.” Black’s Law Dictionary 825 (9th ed. 2009); see&para;<br>also Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1137&para;<br>(1993) (the “state of being imprisoned”). So the word does&para;<br>not distinguish between the defendant’s initial placement&para;<br>behind bars and his continued stay there. As the D. C.&para;<br>Circuit noted in rejecting an identical argument, “[a]&para;<br>sentencing court deciding to keep a defendant locked up&para;<br>for an additional month is, as to that month, in fact choos&para;<br>ing imprisonment over release.” In re Sealed Case, 573&para;<br>F. 3d 844, 850 (2009).4 Accordingly, the word “imprison&para;<br>ment” does not change the function of the “recognizing”&para;<br>clause—to constrain a sentencing court’s decision both to&para;<br>impose and to lengthen a prison term.5&para;<br>The context of §3582(a) puts an exclamation point on&para;<br>this textual conclusion. As noted earlier, supra, at 6,&para;<br>another provision of the SRA restates §3582(a)’s message,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Indeed, we can scarcely imagine a reason why Congress would have&para;<br>wanted to draw the distinction that amicus urges on us. That distinc&para;<br>tion would prevent a court from considering rehabilitative needs in&para;<br>imposing a 1-month sentence rather than probation, but not in choosing&para;<br>a 60-month sentence over a 1-month term. The only policy argument&para;<br>amicus can offer in favor of this result is that “[t]he effects of impris&para;<br>onment plateau a short while after the incarceration” and “ ‘[t]he dif&para;<br>ference in harm between longer and shorter prison terms is smaller&para;<br>than typically assumed.’ ” Amicus Brief 56. But nothing in the SRA&para;<br>indicates that Congress is so indifferent to the length of prison terms.&para;<br>5 The Government argues that “Congress did not intend to prohibit&para;<br>courts from imposing less imprisonment in order to promote a defen&para;<br>dant’s rehabilitation.” Brief for United States 40 (emphasis added).&para;<br>This case does not require us to address that question, and nothing in&para;<br>our decision expresses any views on it.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>TAPIA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>but to a different audience. That provision, 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§994(k), directs the Sentencing Commission to ensure that&para;<br>the Guidelines “reflect the inappropriateness of imposing a&para;<br>sentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of&para;<br>rehabilitating the defendant or providing the defendant&para;<br>with needed educational or vocational training, medical&para;<br>care, or other correctional treatment.” In this way, Con&para;<br>gress ensured that all sentencing officials would work&para;<br>in tandem to implement the statutory determination to&para;<br>“rejec[t] imprisonment as a means of promoting rehabilita&para;<br>tion.” Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 367 (citing 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§994(k)). Section 994(k) bars the Commission from rec&para;<br>ommending a “term of imprisonment”—a phrase that&para;<br>again refers both to the fact and to the length of incarcera&para;<br>tion—based on a defendant’s rehabilitative needs. And&para;<br>§3582(a) prohibits a court from considering those needs to&para;<br>impose or lengthen a period of confinement when selecting&para;<br>a sentence from within, or choosing to depart from, the&para;<br>Guidelines range. Each actor at each stage in the sentenc&para;<br>ing process receives the same message: Do not think about&para;<br>prison as a way to rehabilitate an offender.&para;<br>Equally illuminating here is a statutory silence—the&para;<br>absence of any provision granting courts the power to&para;<br>ensure that offenders participate in prison rehabilitation&para;<br>programs. For when Congress wanted sentencing courts&para;<br>to take account of rehabilitative needs, it gave courts&para;<br>the authority to direct appropriate treatment for offend&para;<br>ers. Thus, the SRA instructs courts, in deciding whether&para;<br>to impose probation or supervised release, to consider&para;<br>whether an offender could benefit from training and treat&para;<br>ment programs. See 18 U. S. C. §3562(a); §3583(c). And&para;<br>so the SRA also authorizes courts, when imposing those&para;<br>sentences, to order an offender’s participation in cer&para;<br>tain programs and facilities. §3563(b)(9); §3563(b)(11);&para;<br>§3563(a)(4); §3583(d). As a condition of probation, for&para;<br>example, the court may require the offender to “undergo&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>available medical, psychiatric, or psychological treatment,&para;<br>including treatment for drug or alcohol dependency, as&para;<br>specified by the court, and [to] remain in a specified insti&para;<br>tution if required for that purpose.” §3563(b)(9).&para;<br>If Congress had similarly meant to allow courts to base&para;<br>prison terms on offenders’ rehabilitative needs, it would&para;<br>have given courts the capacity to ensure that offenders&para;<br>participate in prison correctional programs. But in fact,&para;<br>courts do not have this authority. When a court sentences&para;<br>a federal offender, the BOP has plenary control, subject to&para;<br>statutory constraints, over “the place of the prisoner’s&para;<br>imprisonment,” §3621(b), and the treatment programs (if&para;<br>any) in which he may participate, §§3621(e), (f ); §3624(f ).&para;<br>See also 28 CFR pt. 544 (2010) (BOP regulations for ad&para;<br>ministering inmate educational, recreational, and voca&para;<br>tional programs); 28 CFR pt. 550, subpart F (drug abuse&para;<br>treatment programs). A sentencing court can recommend&para;<br>that the BOP place an offender in a particular facility&para;<br>or program. See §3582(a). But decisionmaking authority&para;<br>rests with the BOP.&para;<br>This case well illustrates the point. As noted earlier,&para;<br>the District Court “strongly recommend[ed]” that Tapia&para;<br>participate in RDAP, App. 29, and serve her sentence at&para;<br>FCI Dublin, “where they have the facilities to really help&para;<br>her,” id., at 28. But the court’s recommendations were&para;<br>only recommendations—and in the end they had no effect.&para;<br>See Amicus Brief 42 (“[Tapia] was not admitted to RDAP,&para;<br>nor even placed in the prison recommended by the district&para;<br>court”); Reply Brief for United States 8, n. 1 (“According to&para;<br>BOP records, [Tapia] was encouraged to enroll [in RDAP]&para;<br>during her psychology intake screening at [the federal&para;<br>prison], but she stated that she was not interested, and&para;<br>she has not volunteered for the program”). The sentencing&para;<br>court may have had plans for Tapia’s rehabilitation, but it&para;<br>lacked the power to implement them. That incapacity&para;<br>speaks volumes. It indicates that Congress did not intend&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>TAPIA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that courts consider offenders’ rehabilitative needs when&para;<br>imposing prison sentences.&para;<br>Finally, for those who consider legislative history useful,&para;<br>the key Senate Report concerning the SRA provides one&para;<br>last piece of corroborating evidence. According to that&para;<br>Report, decades of experience with indeterminate sentenc&para;<br>ing, resulting in the release of many inmates after they&para;<br>completed correctional programs, had left Congress skep&para;<br>tical that “rehabilitation can be induced reliably in a&para;<br>prison setting.” S. Rep., at 38. Although some critics&para;<br>argued that “rehabilitation should be eliminated com&para;<br>pletely as a purpose of sentencing,” Congress declined to&para;<br>adopt that categorical position. Id., at 76. Instead, the&para;<br>Report explains, Congress barred courts from considering&para;<br>rehabilitation in imposing prison terms, ibid., and n. 165,&para;<br>but not in ordering other kinds of sentences, ibid., and&para;<br>n. 164. “[T]he purpose of rehabilitation,” the Report&para;<br>stated, “is still important in determining whether a sanc&para;<br>tion other than a term of imprisonment is appropriate in a&para;<br>particular case.” See id., at 76–77 (emphasis added).&para;<br>And so this is a case in which text, context, and history&para;<br>point to the same bottom line: Section 3582(a) precludes&para;<br>sentencing courts from imposing or lengthening a prison&para;<br>term to promote an offender’s rehabilitation.&para;<br>B&para;<br>With all these sources of statutory meaning stacked&para;<br>against him, amicus understandably tries to put the SRA’s&para;<br>view of rehabilitation in a wholly different frame. Amicus&para;<br>begins by conceding that Congress, in enacting the SRA,&para;<br>rejected the old “[r]ehabilitation [m]odel.” Amicus Brief 1.&para;<br>But according to amicus, that model had a very limited&para;<br>focus: It was the belief that “isolation and prison routine”&para;<br>could alone produce “penitence and spiritual renewal.”&para;<br>Id., at 1, 11. What the rehabilitation model did not in&para;<br>clude—and the SRA therefore did not reject—was prison&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>treatment programs (including for drug addiction) tar&para;<br>geted to offenders’ particular needs. See id., at 21, 25, 27–&para;<br>28. So even after the passage of §3582(a), amicus argues,&para;<br>a court may impose or lengthen a prison sentence to pro&para;<br>mote an offender’s participation in a targeted treatment&para;<br>program. The only thing the court may not do is to impose&para;<br>a prison term on the ground that confinement itself—its&para;<br>inherent solitude and routine—will lead to rehabilitation.&para;<br>We think this reading of the SRA is too narrow. For one&para;<br>thing, the relevant history shows that at the time of&para;<br>the SRA’s enactment, prison rehabilitation efforts focused&para;<br>on treatment, counseling, and training programs, not on&para;<br>seclusion and regimentation. See Rotman, The Failure of&para;<br>Reform: United States, 1865–1965, in Oxford History of&para;<br>the Prison: The Practice of Punishment in Western Society&para;<br>169, 189–190 (N. Morris &amp; D. Rothman eds. 1995) (de&para;<br>scribing the pre-SRA “therapeutic model of rehabilitation”&para;<br>as characterized by “individualized treatment” and “voca&para;<br>tional training and group counseling programs”); see also&para;<br>n. 3, supra (noting pre-SRA statutes linking the confine&para;<br>ment of drug addicts to the completion of treatment pro&para;<br>grams). Indeed, Congress had in mind precisely these&para;<br>programs when it prohibited consideration of rehabilita&para;<br>tion in imposing a prison term. See 28 U. S. C. §994(k)&para;<br>(instructing the Sentencing Commission to prevent the&para;<br>use of imprisonment to “provid[e] the defendant with&para;<br>needed educational or vocational training . . . or other&para;<br>correctional treatment”); S. Rep., at 40 (rejecting the&para;<br>“model of ‘coercive’ rehabilitation—the theory of correction&para;<br>that ties prison release dates to the successful completion&para;<br>of certain vocational, educational, and counseling pro&para;<br>grams within the prisons”). Far from falling outside the&para;<br>“rehabilitation model,” these programs practically defined&para;<br>it.&para;<br>It is hardly surprising, then, that amicus’s argument&para;<br>finds little support in the statutory text. Read most natu&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>TAPIA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rally, 18 U. S. C. §3582(a)’s prohibition on “promoting&para;<br>correction and rehabilitation” covers efforts to place of&para;<br>fenders in rehabilitation programs. Indeed, §3582(a)’s lan&para;<br>guage recalls the SRA’s description of the rehabilitative&para;<br>purpose of sentencing—“provid[ing] the defendant with&para;<br>needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or&para;<br>other correctional treatment.” §3553(a)(2)(D). That de&para;<br>scription makes clear that, under the SRA, treatment,&para;<br>training, and like programs are rehabilitation’s sum and&para;<br>substance. So amicus’s efforts to exclude rehabilitation&para;<br>programs from the “recognizing” clause’s reach do not&para;<br>succeed. That section prevents a sentencing court from&para;<br>imposing or lengthening a prison term because the court&para;<br>thinks an offender will benefit from a prison treatment&para;<br>program.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>In this case, the sentencing transcript suggests the&para;<br>possibility that Tapia’s sentence was based on her reha&para;<br>bilitative needs.&para;<br>We note first what we do not disapprove about Tapia’s&para;<br>sentencing. A court commits no error by discussing the&para;<br>opportunities for rehabilitation within prison or the bene&para;<br>fits of specific treatment or training programs. To the&para;<br>contrary, a court properly may address a person who is&para;<br>about to begin a prison term about these important mat&para;<br>ters. And as noted earlier, a court may urge the BOP to&para;<br>place an offender in a prison treatment program. See&para;<br>supra, at 11. Section 3582(a) itself provides, just after the&para;<br>clause at issue here, that a court may “make a recommen&para;<br>dation concerning the type of prison facility appropriate&para;<br>for the defendant”; and in this calculus, the presence of a&para;<br>rehabilitation program may make one facility more appro&para;<br>priate than another. So the sentencing court here did&para;<br>nothing wrong—and probably something very right—in&para;<br>trying to get Tapia into an effective drug treatment&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>program.&para;<br>But the record indicates that the court may have done&para;<br>more—that it may have selected the length of the sentence&para;<br>to ensure that Tapia could complete the 500 Hour Drug&para;<br>Program. “The sentence has to be sufficient,” the court&para;<br>explained, “to provide needed correctional treatment, and&para;<br>here I think the needed correctional treatment is the&para;<br>500 Hour Drug Program.” App. 27; see supra, at 1–2. Or&para;<br>again: The “number one” thing “is the need to provide&para;<br>treatment. In other words, so she is in long enough to get&para;<br>the 500 Hour Drug Program.” App. 27; see supra, at 2.&para;<br>These statements suggest that the court may have calcu&para;<br>lated the length of Tapia’s sentence to ensure that she&para;<br>receive certain rehabilitative services. And that a sentenc&para;<br>ing court may not do. As we have held, a court may not&para;<br>impose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender&para;<br>to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote&para;<br>rehabilitation.&para;<br>For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the&para;<br>Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed&para;<br>ings consistent with this opinion. Consistent with our&para;<br>practice, see, e.g., United States v. Marcus, 560 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2010) (slip op., at 8), we leave it to the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals to consider the effect of Tapia’s failure to object to&para;<br>the sentence when imposed. See Fed.

S. C.&para;<br>§3582(a) “precludes federal courts from imposing or length&para;<br>ening a prison term in order to promote a criminal de&para;<br>fendant’s rehabilitation.” Ante, at 1. I write separately&para;<br>to note my skepticism that the District Judge violated this&para;<br>proscription in this case.&para;<br>At the sentencing hearing, the District Judge carefully&para;<br>reviewed the sentencing factors set forth in §3553(a).&para;<br>First, he considered “[t]he nature and circumstances of the&para;<br>offense” committed by petitioner Alejandra Tapia—in this&para;<br>case, alien smuggling. App. 25–26; see §3553(a)(1). He&para;<br>emphasized that Tapia’s criminal conduct “created a sub&para;<br>stantial risk of death or serious bodily injury” to the&para;<br>smuggled aliens. App. 26; see also id., at 20 (noting that&para;<br>the aliens were secreted in the vehicle’s gas tank com&para;<br>partment). Second, he reviewed Tapia’s “history and&para;<br>characteristics,” §3553(a)(1), including her history of being&para;<br>abused and her associations “with the wrong people,” id.,&para;<br>at 26. He noted his particular concern about Tapia’s&para;<br>criminal conduct while released on bail, when she failed to&para;<br>appear and was found in an apartment with meth&para;<br>amphetamine, a sawed-off shotgun, and stolen mail.&para;<br>Id., at 25–26. Third, he noted that the offense was&para;<br>“serious,” warranting a “sufficient” sentence. Id., at 26; see&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TAPIA v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>§3553(a)(2)(A). Fourth, he considered the need “to deter&para;<br>criminal conduct” and “to protect the public from further&para;<br>crimes of the defendant,” which he characterized as a “big&para;<br>factor here, given [Tapia’s] failure to appear and what she&para;<br>did out on bail.” App. 26; see §§3553(a)(2)(B), (C). Fifth,&para;<br>he took account of the need “to provide needed correctional&para;<br>treatment,” in this case, the Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) “500&para;<br>Hour Drug Program,” more officially called the Residential&para;<br>Drug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP). App. 27; see&para;<br>§3553(a)(2)(D). And, finally, he noted the need “to avoid&para;<br>unwarranted sentencing disparities” and the need for the&para;<br>sentence “to be sufficient to effect the purposes of 3553(a)&para;<br>but not greater.” App. 27; see §§3553(a), (a)(6).&para;<br>Tapia faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 36&para;<br>months’ incarceration, App. 18, but her Guidelines range&para;<br>was 41 to 51 months, id., at 13. After reviewing the&para;<br>§3553(a) factors, the judge imposed a sentence of 51&para;<br>months, the top of the Guidelines range. He offered two&para;<br>reasons for choosing this sentence: “number one,” the need&para;<br>for drug treatment; and “[n]umber two,” deterrence. Id.,&para;<br>at 27. With respect to the latter reason, the judge high&para;<br>lighted Tapia’s criminal history and her criminal conduct&para;<br>while released on bail—which, he said, was “something&para;<br>that motivates imposing a sentence that in total is at the&para;<br>high end of the guideline range.” Id., at 27–28. He con&para;<br>cluded, “I think that a sentence less than what I am im&para;<br>posing would not deter her and provide for sufficient time&para;<br>so she could begin to address these problems.” Id., at 28.&para;<br>The District Judge’s comments at sentencing suggest&para;<br>that he believed the need to deter Tapia from engaging in&para;<br>further criminal conduct warranted a sentence of 51&para;<br>months’ incarceration. Granted, the judge also mentioned&para;<br>the need to provide drug treatment through the RDAP.&para;<br>The 51-month sentence he selected, however, appears to&para;<br>have had no connection to eligibility for the RDAP. See&para;<br>BOP Program Statement No. P5330.11, §2.5.1(b) (Mar. 16,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>2009) (providing that, to participate in the RDAP, an&para;<br>inmate must ordinarily have at least 24 months remaining&para;<br>on her sentence). Even the 36-month mandatory mini&para;<br>mum would have qualified Tapia for participation in the&para;<br>RDAP. I thus find it questionable that the judge length&para;<br>ened her term of imprisonment beyond that necessary for&para;<br>deterrence in the belief that a 51-month sentence was&para;<br>necessary for rehabilitation. Cf. S. Rep. No. 98–225,&para;<br>p. 176 (1983) (“A term imposed for another purpose of&para;<br>sentencing may . . . have a rehabilitative focus if rehabil&para;<br>itation in such a case is an appropriate secondary purpose&para;<br>of the sentence”).&para;<br>Although I am skeptical that the thoughtful District&para;<br>Judge imposed or lengthened Tapia’s sentence to promote&para;<br>rehabilitation, I acknowledge that his comments at sen&para;<br>tencing were not perfectly clear. Given that Ninth Circuit&para;<br>precedent incorrectly permitted sentencing courts to con&para;<br>sider rehabilitation in setting the length of a sentence, see&para;<br>ante, at 2, and that the judge stated that the sentence&para;<br>needed to be “long enough to get the 500 Hour Drug&para;<br>Program,” App. 27, I cannot be certain that he did not&para;<br>lengthen Tapia’s sentence to promote rehabilitation in&para;<br>violation of §3582(a). I therefore agree with the Court’s&para;<br>disposition of this case and join the Court’s opinion in full.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
