MOORE &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–658.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 12, 2010—Decided January 19, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent Moore and two accomplices attacked and bloodied Kenneth&para;<br>Rogers, tied him up, and threw him in the trunk of a car before driv&para;<br>ing into the Oregon countryside, where Moore fatally shot him. Af&para;<br>terwards, Moore and one accomplice told Moore’s brother and the ac&para;<br>complice’s girlfriend that they had intended to scare Rogers, but that&para;<br>Moore had accidentally shot him. Moore and the accomplice repeated&para;<br>this account to the police. On the advice of counsel, Moore agreed to&para;<br>plead no contest to felony murder in exchange for the minimum sen&para;<br>tence for that offense. He later sought postconviction relief in state&para;<br>court, claiming that he had been denied effective assistance of coun&para;<br>sel. He complained that his lawyer had not moved to suppress his&para;<br>confession to police in advance of the lawyer’s advice that Moore con&para;<br>sidered before accepting the plea offer. The court concluded the sup&para;<br>pression motion would have been fruitless in light of Moore’s other&para;<br>admissible confession to two witnesses. Counsel gave that as his rea&para;<br>son for not making the motion. He added that he had advised Moore&para;<br>that, because of the abuse Rogers suffered before the shooting, Moore&para;<br>could be charged with aggravated murder. That crime was punish&para;<br>able by death or life in prison without parole. These facts led the&para;<br>state court to conclude Moore had not established ineffective assis&para;<br>tance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668.&para;<br>Moore sought federal habeas relief, renewing his ineffective&para;<br>assistance claim. The District Court denied the petition, but the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the state court’s conclusion was&para;<br>an unreasonable application of clearly established law in light of&para;<br>Strickland and was contrary to Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279.&para;<br>Held: Moore was not entitled to the habeas relief ordered by the Ninth&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PREMO v. MOORE&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Circuit. Pp. 4–17.&para;<br>(a) Under 28 U. S. C. §2254(d), federal habeas relief may not be&para;<br>granted with respect to any claim a state court has adjudicated on&para;<br>the merits unless, among other exceptions, the state-court decision&para;<br>denying relief involves “an unreasonable application” of “clearly es&para;<br>tablished Federal law, as determined by” this Court. The relevant&para;<br>federal law is the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel under&para;<br>Strickland, which requires a showing of “both deficient performance&para;<br>by counsel and prejudice.” Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___.&para;<br>Pp. 4–6.&para;<br>(b) The state-court decision was not an unreasonable application of&para;<br>either part of the Strickland rule. Pp. 6–16.&para;<br>(1) The state court would not have been unreasonable to accept&para;<br>as a justification for counsel’s action that suppression would have&para;<br>been futile in light of Moore’s other admissible confession to two wit&para;<br>nesses. This explanation confirms that counsel’s representation was&para;<br>adequate under Strickland, so it is unnecessary to consider the rea&para;<br>sonableness of his other justification—that a suppression motion&para;<br>would have failed. Plea bargains involve complex negotiations suf&para;<br>fused with uncertainty, and defense counsel must make strategic&para;<br>choices in balancing opportunities—pleading to a lesser charge and&para;<br>obtaining a lesser sentence—and risks—that the plea bargain might&para;<br>come before the prosecution finds its case is getting weaker, not&para;<br>stronger. Failure to respect the latitude Strickland requires can cre&para;<br>ate at least two problems. First, the potential for distortions and im&para;<br>balance that can inhere in a hindsight perspective may become all too&para;<br>real; and habeas courts must be mindful of their limited role, to as&para;<br>sess deficiency in light of information then available to counsel. Sec&para;<br>ond, ineffective-assistance claims that lack necessary foundation may&para;<br>bring instability to the very process the inquiry seeks to protect be&para;<br>cause prosecutors must have assurances that a plea will not be un&para;<br>done in court years later. In applying and defining the Strickland&para;<br>standard—reasonable competence in representing the accused—&para;<br>substantial deference must be accorded to counsel’s judgment. The&para;<br>absence of a developed and extensive record and well-defined prose&para;<br>cution or defense case creates a particular risk at the early plea&para;<br>stage. Here, Moore’s prospects at trial were anything but certain.&para;<br>Counsel knew that the two witnesses presented a serious strategic&para;<br>concern and that delaying the plea for further proceedings might al&para;<br>low the State to uncover additional incriminating evidence in support&para;<br>of a capital prosecution. Under these circumstances, counsel made a&para;<br>reasonable choice. At the very least, the state court would not have&para;<br>been unreasonable to so conclude. The Court of Appeals relied fur&para;<br>ther on Fulminante, but a state-court adjudication of counsel’s per&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>formance under the Sixth Amendment cannot be “contrary to” Ful&para;<br>minante, for Fulminante—which involved the admission of an invol&para;<br>untary confession in violation of the Fifth Amendment—says nothing&para;<br>about Strickland’s effectiveness standard. Pp. 6–12.&para;<br>(2) The state court also reasonably could have concluded that&para;<br>Moore was not prejudiced by counsel’s actions. To prevail in state&para;<br>court, he had to demonstrate “a reasonable probability that, but for&para;<br>counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have in&para;<br>sisted on going to trial.” Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 59. Deference&para;<br>to the state court’s prejudice determination is significant, given the&para;<br>uncertainty inherent in plea negotiations. That court reasonably&para;<br>could have determined that Moore would have accepted the plea&para;<br>agreement even if his second confession had been ruled inadmissible.&para;<br>The State’s case was already formidable with two witnesses to an&para;<br>admissible confession, and it could have become stronger had the in&para;<br>vestigation continued. Moore also faced the possibility of grave pun&para;<br>ishments. Counsel’s bargain for the minimum sentence for the crime&para;<br>of conviction was thus favorable, and forgoing a challenge to the con&para;<br>fession may have been essential to securing that agreement. Again,&para;<br>the state court’s finding could not be contrary to Fulminante, which&para;<br>does not speak to Strickland’s prejudice standard or contemplate&para;<br>prejudice in the plea bargain context. To the extent Fulminante’s&para;<br>harmless-error analysis sheds any light on this case, it suggests that&para;<br>the state court’s prejudice determination was reasonable.

Richter, ante, p. ___. Here, as in Richter, the Court&para;<br>reviews a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit granting federal habeas corpus relief in a chal­&para;<br>lenge to a state criminal conviction. Here, too, the case&para;<br>turns on the proper implementation of one of the stated&para;<br>premises for issuance of federal habeas corpus contained&para;<br>in 28 U. S. C. §2254(d), the instruction that federal habeas&para;<br>corpus relief may not be granted with respect to any claim&para;<br>a state court has adjudicated on the merits unless, among&para;<br>other exceptions, the state court’s decision denying relief&para;<br>involves “an unreasonable application” of “clearly estab­&para;<br>lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court&para;<br>of the United States.” And, as in Richter, the relevant&para;<br>clearly established law derives from Strickland v. Wash&para;<br>ington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), which provides the standard&para;<br>for inadequate assistance of counsel under the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment. Richter involves a California conviction and&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PREMO v. MOORE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>addresses the adequacy of representation when counsel&para;<br>did not consult or use certain experts in pretrial prepara­&para;<br>tion and at trial. The instant case involves an unrelated&para;<br>Oregon conviction and concerns the adequacy of represen­&para;<br>tation in providing an assessment of a plea bargain with­&para;<br>out first seeking suppression of a confession assumed to&para;<br>have been improperly obtained.&para;<br>I&para;<br>On December 7, 1995, respondent Randy Moore and two&para;<br>confederates attacked Kenneth Rogers at his home and&para;<br>bloodied him before tying him with duct tape and throw­&para;<br>ing him in the trunk of a car. They drove into the Oregon&para;<br>countryside, where Moore shot Rogers in the temple,&para;<br>killing him.&para;<br>Afterwards, Moore and one of his accomplices told two&para;<br>people—Moore’s brother and the accomplice’s girlfriend—&para;<br>about the crimes. According to Moore’s brother, Moore&para;<br>and his accomplice admitted:&para;<br>“[T]o make an example and put some scare into Mr.&para;<br>Rogers . . ., they had blind-folded him [and] duct taped&para;<br>him and put him in the trunk of the car and took him&para;<br>out to a place that’s a little remote . . . . [T]heir intent&para;<br>was to leave him there and make him walk home . . .&para;<br>[Moore] had taken the revolver from Lonnie and at&para;<br>the time he had taken it, Mr. Rogers had slipped&para;<br>backwards on the mud and the gun discharged.” App.&para;<br>157–158.&para;<br>Moore and his accomplice repeated this account to the&para;<br>police. On the advice of counsel Moore agreed to plead no&para;<br>contest to felony murder in exchange for a sentence of 300&para;<br>months, the minimum sentence allowed by law for the&para;<br>offense.&para;<br>Moore later filed for postconviction relief in an Oregon&para;<br>state court, alleging that he had been denied his right to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>effective assistance of counsel. He complained that his&para;<br>lawyer had not filed a motion to suppress his confession to&para;<br>police in advance of the lawyer’s advice that Moore consid­&para;<br>ered before accepting the plea offer. After an evidentiary&para;<br>hearing, the Oregon court concluded a “motion to suppress&para;<br>would have been fruitless” in light of the other admissible&para;<br>confession by Moore, to which two witnesses could testify.&para;<br>Id., at 140. As the court noted, Moore’s trial counsel ex­&para;<br>plained why he did not move to exclude Moore’s confession&para;<br>to police:&para;<br>“Mr. Moore and I discussed the possibility of filing a&para;<br>Motion to Suppress and concluded that it would be&para;<br>unavailing, because . . . he had previously made a full&para;<br>confession to his brother and to [his accomplice’s girl­&para;<br>friend], either one of whom could have been called as&para;<br>a witness at any time to repeat his confession in full&para;<br>detail.” Jordan Affidavit (Feb. 26, 1999), App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 70, ¶ 4.&para;<br>Counsel added that he had made Moore aware of the&para;<br>possibility of being charged with aggravated murder,&para;<br>which carried a potential death sentence, as well as the&para;<br>possibility of a sentence of life imprisonment without&para;<br>parole. See Ore. Rev. Stat. §163.105(1)(a) (1995). The&para;<br>intense and serious abuse to the victim before the shooting&para;<br>might well have led the State to insist on a strong re­&para;<br>sponse. In light of these facts the Oregon court concluded&para;<br>Moore had not established ineffective assistance of counsel&para;<br>under Strickland.&para;<br>Moore filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United&para;<br>States District Court for the District of Oregon, renewing&para;<br>his ineffective-assistance claim. The District Court denied&para;<br>the petition, finding sufficient evidence to support the&para;<br>Oregon court’s conclusion that suppression would not have&para;<br>made a difference.&para;<br>A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PREMO v. MOORE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>for the Ninth Circuit reversed. Moore v. Czerniak, 574&para;<br>F. 3d 1092 (2009). In its view the state court’s conclusion&para;<br>that counsel’s action did not constitute ineffective assis­&para;<br>tance was an unreasonable application of clearly estab­&para;<br>lished law in light of Strickland and was contrary to&para;<br>Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991). Six judges&para;<br>dissented from denial of rehearing en banc. 574 F. 3d, at&para;<br>1162.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 559 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The statutory authority of federal courts to issue habeas&para;<br>corpus relief for persons in state custody is defined by 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2254, as amended by the Antiterrorism and&para;<br>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The text of&para;<br>§2254(d) states:&para;<br>“An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf&para;<br>of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a&para;<br>State court shall not be granted with respect to any&para;<br>claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State&para;<br>court proceedings unless the adjudication of the&para;<br>claim—&para;<br>“(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or&para;<br>involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab­&para;<br>lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme&para;<br>Court of the United States; or&para;<br>“(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un­&para;<br>reasonable determination of the facts in light of the&para;<br>evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”&para;<br>AEDPA prohibits federal habeas relief for any claim&para;<br>adjudicated on the merits in state court, unless one of the&para;<br>exceptions listed in §2254(d) obtains. Relevant here is&para;<br>§2254(d)(1)’s exception “permitting relitigation where the&para;<br>earlier state decision resulted from an ‘unreasonable&para;<br>application of’ clearly established federal law.” Richter,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ante, at 11. The applicable federal law consists of the&para;<br>rules for determining when a criminal defendant has&para;<br>received inadequate representation as defined in Strick&para;<br>land.&para;<br>To establish ineffective assistance of counsel “a defen­&para;<br>dant must show both deficient performance by counsel and&para;<br>prejudice.” Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2009) (slip op., at 10). In addressing this standard and its&para;<br>relationship to AEDPA, the Court today in Richter, ante,&para;<br>at 14–16, gives the following explanation:&para;<br>“To establish deficient performance, a person chal­&para;<br>lenging a conviction must show that ‘counsel’s repre­&para;<br>sentation fell below an objective standard of rea­&para;<br>sonableness.’ [Strickland,] 466 U. S., at 688. A court&para;<br>considering a claim of ineffective assistance must&para;<br>apply a ‘strong presumption’ that counsel’s represen­&para;<br>tation was within the ‘wide range’ of reasonable pro­&para;<br>fessional assistance. Id., at 689. The challenger’s&para;<br>burden is to show ‘that counsel made errors so serious&para;<br>that counsel was not functioning as the “counsel”&para;<br>guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.’&para;<br>Id., at 687.&para;<br>“With respect to prejudice, a challenger must&para;<br>demonstrate ‘a reasonable probability that, but for&para;<br>counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the&para;<br>proceeding would have been different.’ . . .&para;<br>“ ‘Surmounting Strickland’s high bar is never an&para;<br>easy task.’ Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2010) (slip op., at 14). An ineffective-assistance claim&para;<br>can function as a way to escape rules of waiver and&para;<br>forfeiture and raise issues not presented at trial [or in&para;<br>pretrial proceedings], and so the Strickland standard&para;<br>must be applied with scrupulous care, lest ‘intrusive&para;<br>post-trial inquiry’ threaten the integrity of the very&para;<br>adversary process the right to counsel is meant to&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PREMO v. MOORE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>serve. Strickland, 466 U. S., at 689–690. Even under&para;<br>de novo review, the standard for judging counsel’s&para;<br>representation is a most deferential one. Unlike a&para;<br>later reviewing court, the attorney observed the rele­&para;<br>vant proceedings, knew of materials outside the re­&para;<br>cord, and interacted with the client, with opposing&para;<br>counsel, and with the judge. It is ‘all too tempting’ to&para;<br>‘second-guess counsel’s assistance after conviction or&para;<br>adverse sentence.’ Id., at 689; see also Bell v. Cone,&para;<br>535 U. S. 685, 702 (2002); Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506&para;<br>U. S. 364, 372 (1993). The question is whether an at­&para;<br>torney’s representation amounted to incompetence&para;<br>under ‘prevailing professional norms,’ not whether it&para;<br>deviated from best practices or most common custom.&para;<br>Strickland, 466 U. S., at 690.&para;<br>“Establishing that a state court’s application of&para;<br>Strickland was unreasonable under §2254(d) is all the&para;<br>more difficult. The standards created by Strickland&para;<br>and §2254(d) are both ‘highly deferential,’ id., at 689;&para;<br>Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 333, n. 7 (1997), and&para;<br>when the two apply in tandem, review is ‘doubly’ so,&para;<br>Knowles, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). The Strick&para;<br>land standard is a general one, so the range of rea­&para;<br>sonable applications is substantial. 556 U. S., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 11). Federal habeas courts must guard&para;<br>against the danger of equating unreasonableness un­&para;<br>der Strickland with unreasonableness under §2254(d).&para;<br>When §2254(d) applies, the question is not whether&para;<br>counsel’s actions were reasonable. The question is&para;<br>whether there is any reasonable argument that coun­&para;<br>sel satisfied Strickland’s deferential standard.”&para;<br>III&para;<br>The question becomes whether Moore’s counsel provided&para;<br>ineffective assistance by failing to seek suppression of&para;<br>Moore’s confession to police before advising Moore regard­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ing the plea. Finding that any “motion to suppress would&para;<br>have been fruitless,” the state postconviction court con­&para;<br>cluded that Moore had not received ineffective assistance&para;<br>of counsel. App. 140. The state court did not specify&para;<br>whether this was because there was no deficient perform­&para;<br>ance under Strickland or because Moore suffered no&para;<br>Strickland prejudice, or both. To overcome the limitation&para;<br>imposed by § 2254(d), the Court of Appeals had to con­&para;<br>clude that both findings would have involved an unrea­&para;<br>sonable application of clearly established federal law. See&para;<br>Richter, ante, at 19–20. In finding that this standard was&para;<br>met, the Court of Appeals erred, for the state-court deci­&para;<br>sion was not an unreasonable application of either part of&para;<br>the Strickland rule.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Court of Appeals was wrong to accord scant defer­&para;<br>ence to counsel’s judgment, and doubly wrong to conclude&para;<br>it would have been unreasonable to find that the defense&para;<br>attorney qualified as counsel for Sixth Amendment pur­&para;<br>poses. Knowles, supra, at ––– (slip op., at 11); Strickland,&para;<br>466 U. S., at 687. Counsel gave this explanation for his&para;<br>decision to discuss the plea bargain without first challeng­&para;<br>ing Moore’s confession to the police: that suppression&para;<br>would serve little purpose in light of Moore’s other full and&para;<br>admissible confession, to which both his brother and his&para;<br>accomplice’s girlfriend could testify. The state court would&para;<br>not have been unreasonable to accept this explanation.&para;<br>Counsel also justified his decision by asserting that any&para;<br>motion to suppress was likely to fail. Reviewing the rea­&para;<br>sonableness of that justification is complicated by the&para;<br>possibility that petitioner forfeited one argument that&para;<br>would have supported its position: The Court of Appeals&para;<br>assumed that a motion would have succeeded because the&para;<br>warden did not argue otherwise. Of course that is not the&para;<br>same as a concession that no competent attorney would&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PREMO v. MOORE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>think a motion to suppress would have failed, which is the&para;<br>relevant question under Strickland. See Kimmelman v.&para;<br>Morrison, 477 U. S. 365, 382 (1986); Richter, ante, at 19–&para;<br>20. It is unnecessary to consider whether counsel’s second&para;<br>justification was reasonable, however, since the first and&para;<br>independent explanation—that suppression would have&para;<br>been futile—confirms that his representation was ade­&para;<br>quate under Strickland, or at least that it would&para;<br>have been reasonable for the state court to reach that&para;<br>conclusion.&para;<br>Acknowledging guilt and accepting responsibility by an&para;<br>early plea respond to certain basic premises in the law and&para;<br>its function. Those principles are eroded if a guilty plea is&para;<br>too easily set aside based on facts and circumstances not&para;<br>apparent to a competent attorney when actions and advice&para;<br>leading to the plea took place. Plea bargains are the&para;<br>result of complex negotiations suffused with uncertainty,&para;<br>and defense attorneys must make careful strategic choices&para;<br>in balancing opportunities and risks. The opportunities, of&para;<br>course, include pleading to a lesser charge and obtaining a&para;<br>lesser sentence, as compared with what might be the&para;<br>outcome not only at trial but also from a later plea offer if&para;<br>the case grows stronger and prosecutors find stiffened&para;<br>resolve. A risk, in addition to the obvious one of losing the&para;<br>chance for a defense verdict, is that an early plea bargain&para;<br>might come before the prosecution finds its case is getting&para;<br>weaker, not stronger. The State’s case can begin to fall&para;<br>apart as stories change, witnesses become unavailable,&para;<br>and new suspects are identified.&para;<br>These considerations make strict adherence to the&para;<br>Strickland standard all the more essential when reviewing&para;<br>the choices an attorney made at the plea bargain stage.&para;<br>Failure to respect the latitude Strickland requires can&para;<br>create at least two problems in the plea context. First, the&para;<br>potential for the distortions and imbalance that can inhere&para;<br>in a hindsight perspective may become all too real. The&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>art of negotiation is at least as nuanced as the art of trial&para;<br>advocacy and it presents questions farther removed from&para;<br>immediate judicial supervision. There are, moreover,&para;<br>special difficulties in evaluating the basis for counsel’s&para;<br>judgment: An attorney often has insights borne of past&para;<br>dealings with the same prosecutor or court, and the record&para;<br>at the pretrial stage is never as full as it is after a trial. In&para;<br>determining how searching and exacting their review&para;<br>must be, habeas courts must respect their limited role&para;<br>in determining whether there was manifest deficiency in&para;<br>light of information then available to counsel. Lockhart v.&para;<br>Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364, 372 (1993). AEDPA compounds&para;<br>the imperative of judicial caution.&para;<br>Second, ineffective-assistance claims that lack necessary&para;<br>foundation may bring instability to the very process the&para;<br>inquiry seeks to protect. Strickland allows a defendant “to&para;<br>escape rules of waiver and forfeiture,” Richter, ante, at 15.&para;<br>Prosecutors must have assurance that a plea will not be&para;<br>undone years later because of infidelity to the require­&para;<br>ments of AEDPA and the teachings of Strickland. The&para;<br>prospect that a plea deal will afterwards be unraveled&para;<br>when a court second-guesses counsel’s decisions while&para;<br>failing to accord the latitude Strickland mandates or&para;<br>disregarding the structure dictated by AEDPA could lead&para;<br>prosecutors to forgo plea bargains that would benefit&para;<br>defendants, a result favorable to no one.&para;<br>Whether before, during, or after trial, when the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment applies, the formulation of the standard is the&para;<br>same: reasonable competence in representing the accused.&para;<br>Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688. In applying and defining&para;<br>this standard substantial deference must be accorded to&para;<br>counsel’s judgment. Id., at 689. But at different stages of&para;<br>the case that deference may be measured in different&para;<br>ways.&para;<br>In the case of an early plea, neither the prosecution nor&para;<br>the defense may know with much certainty what course&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PREMO v.

It follows that each side, of necessity,&para;<br>risks consequences that may arise from contingencies or&para;<br>circumstances yet unperceived. The absence of a devel­&para;<br>oped or an extensive record and the circumstance that&para;<br>neither the prosecution nor the defense case has been well&para;<br>defined create a particular risk that an after-the-fact&para;<br>assessment will run counter to the deference that must be&para;<br>accorded counsel’s judgment and perspective when the&para;<br>plea was negotiated, offered, and entered.&para;<br>Prosecutors in the present case faced the cost of litiga­&para;<br>tion and the risk of trying their case without Moore’s&para;<br>confession to the police. Moore’s counsel could reasonably&para;<br>believe that a swift plea bargain would allow Moore to&para;<br>take advantage of the State’s aversion to these hazards.&para;<br>And whenever cases involve multiple defendants, there is&para;<br>a chance that prosecutors might convince one defendant&para;<br>to testify against another in exchange for a better deal.&para;<br>Moore’s plea eliminated that possibility and ended an&para;<br>ongoing investigation. Delaying the plea for further pro­&para;<br>ceedings would have given the State time to uncover&para;<br>additional incriminating evidence that could have formed&para;<br>the basis of a capital prosecution. It must be remem­&para;<br>bered, after all, that Moore’s claim that it was an accident&para;<br>when he shot the victim through the temple might be&para;<br>disbelieved.&para;<br>It is not clear how the successful exclusion of the confes­&para;<br>sion would have affected counsel’s strategic calculus. The&para;<br>prosecution had at its disposal two witnesses able to relate&para;<br>another confession. True, Moore’s brother and the girl­&para;<br>friend of his accomplice might have changed their ac­&para;<br>counts in a manner favorable to Moore. But the record&para;<br>before the state court reveals no reason to believe that&para;<br>either witness would violate the legal obligation to convey&para;<br>the content of Moore’s confession. And to the extent that&para;<br>his accomplice’s girlfriend had an ongoing interest in the&para;<br>matter, she might have been tempted to put more blame,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>not less, on Moore. Then, too, the accomplices themselves&para;<br>might have decided to implicate Moore to a greater extent&para;<br>than his own confession did, say by indicating that Moore&para;<br>shot the victim deliberately, not accidentally. All these&para;<br>possibilities are speculative. What counsel knew at the&para;<br>time was that the existence of the two witnesses to an&para;<br>additional confession posed a serious strategic concern.&para;<br>Moore’s prospects at trial were thus anything but cer­&para;<br>tain. Even now, he does not deny any involvement in the&para;<br>kidnaping and killing. In these circumstances, and with a&para;<br>potential capital charge lurking, Moore’s counsel made a&para;<br>reasonable choice to opt for a quick plea bargain. At the&para;<br>very least, the state court would not have been unreason­&para;<br>able to so conclude. Cf. Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S.&para;<br>652, 664 (2004) (explaining that state courts enjoy “more&para;<br>leeway” under AEDPA in applying general standards).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals’ contrary holding rests on a case&para;<br>that did not involve ineffective assistance of counsel:&para;<br>Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991). To reach&para;<br>that result, it transposed that case into a novel context;&para;<br>and novelty alone—at least insofar as it renders the rele­&para;<br>vant rule less than “clearly established”—provides a rea­&para;<br>son to reject it under AEDPA. See Yarborough, supra, at&para;<br>666 (“Section 2254(d)(1) would be undermined if habeas&para;<br>courts introduced rules not clearly established under the&para;<br>guise of extensions to existing law . . .[, although c]ertain&para;<br>principles are fundamental enough that when new factual&para;<br>permutations arise, the necessity to apply the earlier rule&para;<br>will be beyond doubt”). And the transposition is improper&para;<br>even on its own terms. According to the Court of Appeals,&para;<br>“Fulminante stands for the proposition that the admission&para;<br>of an additional confession ordinarily reinforces and cor­&para;<br>roborates the others and is therefore prejudicial.” 574&para;<br>F. 3d, at 1111. Based on that reading, the Court of Ap­&para;<br>peals held that the state court’s decision “was contrary to&para;<br>Fulminante.” Id., at 1102. But Fulminante may not be so&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>PREMO v. MOORE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>incorporated into the Strickland performance inquiry.&para;<br>A state-court adjudication of the performance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment cannot be “contrary to”&para;<br>Fulminante, for Fulminante—which involved the admis­&para;<br>sion of an involuntary confession in violation of the Fifth&para;<br>Amendment—says nothing about the Strickland standard&para;<br>of effectiveness. See Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 694&para;<br>(2002) (“A federal habeas court may issue the writ under&para;<br>the ‘contrary to’ clause if the state court applies a rule&para;<br>different from the governing law set forth in our cases, or&para;<br>if it decides a case differently than we have done on a set&para;<br>of materially indistinguishable facts”). The Fulminante&para;<br>prejudice inquiry presumes a constitutional violation,&para;<br>whereas Strickland seeks to define one. The state court&para;<br>accepted counsel’s view that seeking to suppress Moore’s&para;<br>second confession would have been “fruitless.” It would&para;<br>not have been unreasonable to conclude that counsel could&para;<br>incorporate that view into his assessment of a plea offer, a&para;<br>subject with which Fulminante is in no way concerned.&para;<br>A finding of constitutionally adequate performance&para;<br>under Strickland cannot be contrary to Fulminante. The&para;<br>state court likely reached the correct result under Strick&para;<br>land. And under §2254(d), that it reached a reasonable&para;<br>one is sufficient. See Richter, ante, at 19.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Court of Appeals further concluded that it would&para;<br>have been unreasonable for the state postconviction court&para;<br>to have found no prejudice in counsel’s failure to suppress&para;<br>Moore’s confession to police. To prevail on prejudice before&para;<br>the state court Moore had to demonstrate “a reasonable&para;<br>probability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would not&para;<br>have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to&para;<br>trial.” Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52, 59 (1985).&para;<br>Deference to the state court’s prejudice determination is&para;<br>all the more significant in light of the uncertainty inherent&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>in plea negotiations described above: The stakes for defen­&para;<br>dants are high, and many elect to limit risk by forgoing&para;<br>the right to assert their innocence. A defendant who&para;<br>accepts a plea bargain on counsel’s advice does not neces­&para;<br>sarily suffer prejudice when his counsel fails to seek sup­&para;<br>pression of evidence, even if it would be reversible error&para;<br>for the court to admit that evidence.&para;<br>The state court here reasonably could have determined&para;<br>that Moore would have accepted the plea agreement even&para;<br>if his second confession had been ruled inadmissible. By&para;<br>the time the plea agreement cut short investigation of&para;<br>Moore’s crimes, the State’s case was already formidable&para;<br>and included two witnesses to an admissible confession.&para;<br>Had the prosecution continued to investigate, its case&para;<br>might well have become stronger. At the same time,&para;<br>Moore faced grave punishments. His decision to plead no&para;<br>contest allowed him to avoid a possible sentence of life&para;<br>without parole or death. The bargain counsel struck was&para;<br>thus a favorable one—the statutory minimum for the&para;<br>charged offense—and the decision to forgo a challenge to&para;<br>the confession may have been essential to securing that&para;<br>agreement.&para;<br>Once again the Court of Appeals reached a contrary&para;<br>conclusion by pointing to Fulminante: “The state court’s&para;<br>finding that a motion to suppress a recorded confession to&para;<br>the police would have been ‘fruitless’ . . . was without&para;<br>question contrary to clearly established federal law as set&para;<br>forth in Fulminante.” 574 F. 3d, at 1112. And again there&para;<br>is no sense in which the state court’s finding could be&para;<br>contrary to Fulminante, for Fulminante says nothing&para;<br>about prejudice for Strickland purposes, nor does it con­&para;<br>template prejudice in the plea bargain context.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals appears to have treated Fulmi&para;<br>nante as a per se rule of prejudice, or something close to&para;<br>it, in all cases involving suppressible confessions. It is&para;<br>not. In Fulminante five Justices made the uncontroversial&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>PREMO v. MOORE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>observation that many confessions are powerful evidence.&para;<br>See, e.g., 499 U. S., at 296. Fulminante’s prejudice analy­&para;<br>sis arose on direct review following an acknowledged&para;<br>constitutional error at trial. The State therefore had the&para;<br>burden of showing that it was “clear beyond a reasonable&para;<br>doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant&para;<br>guilty absent the error.” Neder v. United States, 527 U. S.&para;<br>1, 18 (1999) (paraphrasing Fulminante, supra). That&para;<br>standard cannot apply to determinations of whether in­&para;<br>adequate assistance of counsel prejudiced a defendant who&para;<br>entered into a plea agreement. Many defendants reasona­&para;<br>bly enter plea agreements even though there is a signifi­&para;<br>cant probability—much more than a reasonable doubt—&para;<br>that they would be acquitted if they proceeded to trial.&para;<br>Thus, the question in the present case is not whether&para;<br>Moore was sure beyond a reasonable doubt that he would&para;<br>still be convicted if the extra confession were suppressed.&para;<br>It is whether Moore established the reasonable probability&para;<br>that he would not have entered his plea but for his coun­&para;<br>sel’s deficiency, Hill, supra, at 59, and more to the point,&para;<br>whether a state court’s decision to the contrary would be&para;<br>unreasonable.&para;<br>To the extent Fulminante’s application of the harmless­&para;<br>error standard sheds any light on the present case, it&para;<br>suggests that the state court’s prejudice determination&para;<br>was reasonable. Fulminante found that an improperly&para;<br>admitted confession was not harmless under Chapman v.&para;<br>California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967) because the remaining&para;<br>evidence against the defendant was weak. The additional&para;<br>evidence consisted primarily of a second confession that&para;<br>Fulminante had made to the informant’s fiancée. But&para;<br>many of its details were not corroborated, the fiancée had&para;<br>not reported the confession for a long period of time, the&para;<br>State had indicated that both confessions were essential to&para;<br>its case, and the fiancée potentially “had a motive to lie.”&para;<br>499 U. S., at 300. Moore’s plea agreement, by contrast,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ended the government’s investigation well before trial, yet&para;<br>the evidence against Moore was strong. The accounts of&para;<br>Moore’s second confession to his brother and his accom­&para;<br>plice’s girlfriend corroborated each other, were given to&para;<br>people without apparent reason to lie, and were reported&para;<br>without delay.&para;<br>The State gave no indication that its felony-murder&para;<br>prosecution depended on the admission of the police con­&para;<br>fession, and Moore does not now deny that he kidnaped&para;<br>and killed Rogers. Given all this, an unconstitutional&para;<br>admission of Moore’s confession to police might well have&para;<br>been found harmless even on direct review if Moore had&para;<br>gone to trial after the denial of a suppression motion.&para;<br>Other than for its discussion of the basic proposition&para;<br>that a confession is often powerful evidence, Fulminante is&para;<br>not relevant to the present case. The state postconviction&para;<br>court reasonably could have concluded that Moore was&para;<br>not prejudiced by counsel’s actions. Under AEDPA, that&para;<br>finding ends federal review. See Richter, ante, at 19.&para;<br>Judge Berzon’s concurring opinion in the Court of Ap­&para;<br>peals does not provide a basis for issuance of the writ. The&para;<br>concurring opinion would have found the state court’s&para;<br>prejudice determination unreasonable in light of Kimmel&para;<br>man. It relied on Kimmelman to find that Moore suffered&para;<br>prejudice for Strickland purposes because there was&para;<br>a reasonable possibility that he would have obtained a&para;<br>better plea agreement but for his counsel’s errors. But&para;<br>Kimmelman concerned a conviction following a bench&para;<br>trial, so it did not establish, much less clearly establish,&para;<br>the appropriate standard for prejudice in cases involving&para;<br>plea bargains. See 477 U. S., at 389. That standard was&para;<br>established in Hill, which held that a defendant who&para;<br>enters a plea agreement must show “a reasonable prob­&para;<br>ability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would not have&para;<br>pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.”&para;<br>474 U. S., at 59. Moore’s failure to make that showing&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>PREMO v. MOORE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>forecloses relief under AEDPA.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>There are certain differences between inadequate assis­&para;<br>tance of counsel claims in cases where there was a full&para;<br>trial on the merits and those, like this one, where a plea&para;<br>was entered even before the prosecution decided upon all&para;<br>of the charges. A trial provides the full written record and&para;<br>factual background that serve to limit and clarify some of&para;<br>the choices counsel made. Still, hindsight cannot suffice&para;<br>for relief when counsel’s choices were reasonable and&para;<br>legitimate based on predictions of how the trial would&para;<br>proceed. See Richter, ante, at 18.&para;<br>Hindsight and second guesses are also inappropriate,&para;<br>and often more so, where a plea has been entered without&para;<br>a full trial or, as in this case, even before the prosecution&para;<br>decided on the charges. The added uncertainty that re­&para;<br>sults when there is no extended, formal record and no&para;<br>actual history to show how the charges have played out at&para;<br>trial works against the party alleging inadequate assis­&para;<br>tance. Counsel, too, faced that uncertainty. There is a&para;<br>most substantial burden on the claimant to show ineffec­&para;<br>tive assistance.
