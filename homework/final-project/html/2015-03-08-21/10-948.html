The Federal District Court denied the defendants’ motion to&para;<br>compel arbitration, concluding that Congress intended CROA claims&para;<br>to be nonarbitrable. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: Because the CROA is silent on whether claims under the Act can&para;<br>proceed in an arbitrable forum, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) requires the arbitration agreement to be enforced according to its&para;<br>terms. Pp. 2–10.&para;<br>(a) Section 2 of the FAA establishes “a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration.” Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24. It requires that courts enforce arbitration&para;<br>agreements according to their terms. See Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.&para;<br>v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 221. That is the case even when federal statutory claims are at issue, unless the FAA’s mandate has been “overridden by a contrary congressional command.” Shearson/American&para;<br>Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 226. Pp. 2–3.&para;<br>(b) The CROA provides no such command. Respondents contend&para;<br>that the CROA’s disclosure provision—which requires credit repair&para;<br>organizations to provide consumers with a statement that includes&para;<br>the sentence “ ‘You have a right to sue a credit repair organization&para;<br>that violates the [Act],’ ” 15 U. S. C. §1679c(a)—gives consumers the&para;<br>right to bring an action in a court of law; and that, because the CROA&para;<br>prohibits the waiver of “any right of the consumer under this subchapter,” §1679f(a), the arbitration agreement’s waiver of the “right”&para;<br>to bring a court action cannot be enforced. Respondents’ premise is&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>flawed. The disclosure provision creates only a right for consumers to&para;<br>receive a specific statement describing the consumer protections that&para;<br>the law elsewhere provides, one of which is the right to enforce a&para;<br>credit repair organization’s “liab[ility]” for “fail[ure] to comply with&para;<br>[the Act].” §1679g(a). That provision does not override the FAA’s&para;<br>mandate. Its mere contemplation of judicial enforcement does not&para;<br>demonstrate that the Act provides consumers with a “right” to initial&para;<br>judicial enforcement. Pp. 3–8.&para;<br>(c) At the time of the CROA’s enactment in 1996, arbitration clauses such as the one at issue were no rarity in consumer contracts generally, or in financial services contracts in particular.

It&para;<br>requires courts to enforce agreements to arbitrate according to their terms. See Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd,&para;<br>470 U. S. 213, 221 (1985). That is the case even when&para;<br>the claims at issue are federal statutory claims, unless the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

Respondents contend that the CROA&para;<br>contains such a command.&para;<br>That statute regulates the practices of credit repair&para;<br>organizations, defined as certain entities that offer services for the purpose of “(i) improving any consumer’s&para;<br>credit record, credit history, or credit rating; or (ii) providing advice or assistance to any consumer with regard to&para;<br>any activity or service described in clause (i).”1 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1679a(3). In its principal substantive provisions, the&para;<br>CROA prohibits certain practices, §1679b, establishes&para;<br>certain requirements for contracts with consumers,&para;<br>§1679d, and gives consumers a right to cancel, §1679e.&para;<br>Enforcement is achieved through the Act’s provision of a&para;<br>private cause of action for violation, §1679g, as well as&para;<br>through federal and state administrative enforcement,&para;<br>§1679h.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Like the District Court and the Ninth Circuit, respondents focus on the CROA’s disclosure and nonwaiver provisions. The former, which is reproduced in full in the&para;<br>Appendix, infra, sets forth a statement that the credit repair organization must provide to the consumer before any&para;<br>contract is executed. §1679c(a). One sentence of that&para;<br>required statement reads, “ ‘You have a right to sue a&para;<br>credit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair&para;<br>Organization Act.’ ” The Act’s nonwaiver provision states,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>District Court said that petitioners do not dispute that they&para;<br>come within this definition. See 617 F. Supp. 980, 984, n. 2 (ND Cal.&para;<br>2009). The Ninth Circuit did not address that issue, see 615 F. 3d&para;<br>1204, 1207, n. 3 (2010), nor do we.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“Any waiver by any consumer of any protection provided&para;<br>by or any right of the consumer under this subchapter—&para;<br>(1) shall be treated as void; and (2) may not be enforced&para;<br>by any Federal or State court or any other person.”&para;<br>§1679f(a).&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit adopted the following line of reasoning, urged upon us by respondents here: The disclosure&para;<br>provision gives consumers the “right to sue,” which “clearly involves the right to bring an action in a court of law.”&para;<br>615 F. 3d, at 1208. Because the nonwaiver provision&para;<br>prohibits the waiver of “any right of the consumer under&para;<br>this subchapter,” the arbitration agreement—which&para;<br>waived the right to bring an action in a court of law—&para;<br>cannot be enforced. Id., at 1214.&para;<br>The flaw in this argument is its premise: that the disclosure provision provides consumers with a right to bring an&para;<br>action in a court of law. It does not. Rather, it imposes an&para;<br>obligation on credit repair organizations to supply consumers with a specific statement set forth (in quotation&para;<br>marks) in the statute. The only consumer right it creates&para;<br>is the right to receive the statement, which is meant to&para;<br>describe the consumer protections that the law elsewhere&para;<br>provides. The statement informs consumers, for instance,&para;<br>that they can dispute the accuracy of information in their&para;<br>credit file and that “ ‘[t]he credit bureau must then reinvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete&para;<br>information.’ ” 15 U. S. C. §1679c(a). That description is&para;<br>derived from §1681i(a), which sets out in great detail the&para;<br>procedures to be followed by a credit bureau in the event&para;<br>of challenges to the accuracy of its information. Similarly,&para;<br>the required statement informs consumers that they may&para;<br>“ ‘cancel your contract with any credit repair organization&para;<br>for any reason within 3 business days from the date you&para;<br>signed it’ ”—the right created and set forth in more detail&para;<br>in §1679e. And the “right to sue” language describes the&para;<br>consumer’s right to enforce the credit repair organization’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“liab[ility]” for “fail[ure] to comply with any provision of&para;<br>this subchapter” provided for in §1679g(a).2 Thus, contrary to the dissent’s assertion, our interpretation does not&para;<br>“[r]educ[e] the required disclosure to insignificance,” post,&para;<br>at 6. The disclosure provision informs consumers of their&para;<br>right to enforce liability for any failure to conform to the&para;<br>statute—information they might otherwise not possess. It&para;<br>is the dissent’s interpretation that effectively reduces a&para;<br>portion of the CROA to a nullity. Interpreting the “right&para;<br>to sue” language in §1679c(a) to “create” a right to sue in&para;<br>court not only renders it strikingly out of place in a section&para;<br>that is otherwise devoted to giving the consumer notice of&para;<br>rights created elsewhere; it also renders the creation of the&para;<br>“right to sue” elsewhere superfluous.&para;<br>Respondents suggest that the CROA’s civil-liability provision, §1679g (set forth in full in the Appendix, infra),&para;<br>demonstrates that the Act provides consumers with a&para;<br>“right” to bring an action in court. They cite the provision’s repeated use of the terms “action,” “class action,”&para;<br>and “court”—terms that they say call to mind a judicial&para;<br>proceeding. These references cannot do the heavy lifting&para;<br>that respondents assign them. It is utterly commonplace&para;<br>for statutes that create civil causes of action to describe&para;<br>the details of those causes of action, including the relief&para;<br>available, in the context of a court suit. If the mere formulation of the cause of action in this standard fashion were&para;<br>sufficient to establish the “contrary congressional com——————&para;<br>2 Accordingly,&para;<br>&para;<br>when a consumer sues to enforce liability under the&para;<br>CROA, he does so under §1679g(a), not “in light of §1679c,” post, at 4&para;<br>(GINSBURG, J., dissenting). An action under the CROA need not refer&para;<br>to §1679c at all, unless it is based on the company’s failure to provide&para;<br>the statement required under that section. Section 1679g(a) creates the&para;<br>“right” at issue and describes it in detail not contained in §1679c’s&para;<br>summary. When determining the scope of that right, it is therefore&para;<br>§1679g(a)—and not §1679c—that must govern.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>mand” overriding the FAA, McMahon, supra, at 226, valid&para;<br>arbitration agreements covering federal causes of action&para;<br>would be rare indeed. But that is not the law. In Gilmer&para;<br>we enforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a&para;<br>cause of action created by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) which read, in part: “Any&para;<br>person aggrieved may bring a civil action in any court of&para;<br>competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as&para;<br>will effectuate the purposes of this chapter.” 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§626(c)(1).&para;<br>In McMahon we enforced an arbitration&para;<br>agreement with respect to a cause of action created by a&para;<br>provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) which read, in part: “Any person&para;<br>injured in his business or property by reason of a violation&para;<br>of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any&para;<br>appropriate United States district court and shall recover&para;<br>threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit&para;<br>. . . .” 18 U. S. C. §1964(c). And in Mitsubishi Motors we&para;<br>enforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a cause&para;<br>of action created by a provision of the Clayton Act which&para;<br>read, in part: “[A]ny person who shall be injured in his&para;<br>business or property by reason of anything forbidden in&para;<br>the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of&para;<br>the United States . . . and shall recover threefold the&para;<br>damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including&para;<br>a reasonable attorney’s fee.” 15 U. S. C. §15(a). Thus, we&para;<br>have repeatedly recognized that contractually required&para;<br>arbitration of claims satisfies the statutory prescription&para;<br>of civil liability in court. See Gilmer, 500 U. S., at 28;&para;<br>McMahon, 482 U. S., at 240; Mitsubishi Motors, 473 U. S.,&para;<br>at 637. To be sure, none of the statutes described above&para;<br>contained a nonwaiver provision, as the statute before us&para;<br>does. But if a cause-of-action provision mentioning judicial enforcement does not create a right to initial judicial&para;<br>enforcement, the waiver of initial judicial enforcement is&para;<br>not the waiver of a “right of the consumer,” §1679f(a). It&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>takes a considerable stretch to regard the nonwaiver&para;<br>provision as a “congressional command” that the FAA&para;<br>shall not apply.3&para;<br>Moreover, if one believes that §1679g’s contemplation of&para;<br>court suit (combined with §1679f(a)) establishes a nonwaivable right to initial judicial enforcement, one must also&para;<br>believe that it establishes a nonwaivable right to initial&para;<br>judicial enforcement in any competent judicial tribunal,&para;<br>since it contains no limitation. We think it clear, however,&para;<br>that this mere “contemplation” of suit in any competent&para;<br>court does not guarantee suit in all competent courts,&para;<br>disabling the parties from adopting a reasonable forumselection clause. And just as the contemplated availability&para;<br>of all judicial forums may be reduced to a single forum by&para;<br>contractual specification, so also can the contemplated&para;<br>availability of judicial action be limited to judicial action&para;<br>compelling or reviewing initial arbitral adjudication. The&para;<br>parties remain free to specify such matters, so long as the&para;<br>guarantee of §1679g—the guarantee of the legal power to&para;<br>impose liability—is preserved.&para;<br>Respondents and the dissent maintain that if the CROA&para;<br>does not create a right to a judicial forum, then the disclosure provision effectively requires that credit repair organizations mislead consumers. We think not. The disclosure&para;<br>provision is meant to describe the law to consumers in a&para;<br>manner that is concise and comprehensible to the layman—which necessarily means that it will be imprecise.&para;<br>The required statement says, for example, that the CROA&para;<br>“ ‘prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organiza——————&para;<br>3 Gilmer noted that the ADEA had been amended after conclusion of&para;<br>the arbitration agreement in that case to preclude waiver of “rights&para;<br>or claims that may arise after the date the waiver is executed.” 29&para;<br>U. S. C. §626(f)(1)(C). The Court said in dictum that this provision “did&para;<br>not explicitly preclude arbitration or other nonjudicial resolution of&para;<br>claims,” 500 U. S., at 29.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>COMPUCREDIT CORP. v. GREENWOOD&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tions,’ ” 15 U. S. C. §1679c(a). This is in some respects an&para;<br>overstatement, and in some respects an understatement,&para;<br>of the “Prohibited practices” set forth in §1679b. It would&para;<br>include, for example, deception apart from “the offer or&para;<br>sale of the services of the credit repair organization,”&para;<br>§1679b(a)(4). Yet we would not hold, in order to prevent&para;<br>the required statement from being “misleading,” that a&para;<br>consumer has a right to be protected from deceptive practices beyond those actually covered by §1679b. So also&para;<br>with respect to the statement’s description of a “right to&para;<br>sue.” This is a colloquial method of communicating to&para;<br>consumers that they have the legal right, enforceable in&para;<br>court, to recover damages from credit repair organizations&para;<br>that violate the CROA. We think most consumers would&para;<br>understand it this way, without regard to whether the suit&para;<br>in court has to be preceded by an arbitration proceeding.&para;<br>Leaving that possibility out may be imprecise, but it is not&para;<br>misleading—and certainly not so misleading as to demand, in order to avoid that result, reading the statute to&para;<br>contain a guaranteed right it does not in fact contain.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>At the time of the CROA’s enactment in 1996, arbitration clauses in contracts of the type at issue here were no&para;<br>rarity.

But for the reasons stated by the dissent, I&para;<br>find this to be a much closer case than the majority opinion suggests.&para;<br>The Act creates a cause of action in its liability provision, see §1679g(a), denominates the cause of action a&para;<br>“right to sue” in the mandatory disclosure statement,&para;<br>§1679c(a), and then provides that “right[s]” may not be&para;<br>waived, §1679f(a). Those for whom Congress wrote the&para;<br>Act—lay readers “of limited economic means and . . .&para;<br>inexperienced in credit matters,” §1679(a)(2)—reasonably&para;<br>may interpret the phrase “right to sue” as promising a&para;<br>right to sue in court. And it is plausible to think that&para;<br>Congress, aware of the impact of its words, intended such&para;<br>a construction of the liability provision.&para;<br>But while this interpretation of the Act is plausible, it is&para;<br>in my view no more compelling than the contrary con-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>COMPUCREDIT CORP. v.

As the majority opinion&para;<br>notes, the disclosure provision does not itself confer a&para;<br>cause of action, and the liability provision that does is&para;<br>materially indistinguishable from other statutes that we&para;<br>have held not to preclude arbitration. In my mind this&para;<br>leaves the parties’ arguments in equipoise, and our precedents require that petitioners prevail in this circumstance.&para;<br>This is because respondents, as the opponents of arbitration, bear the burden of showing that Congress disallowed&para;<br>arbitration of their claims, and because we resolve doubts&para;<br>in favor of arbitration. See id., at 26. Of course, if we&para;<br>have misread Congress’ intent, then Congress can correct&para;<br>our error by amending the statute.&para;<br>I add one more point. The majority opinion contrasts&para;<br>the liability provision of the Act with other, more recently&para;<br>enacted statutes that expressly disallow arbitration. I do&para;<br>not understand the majority opinion to hold that Congress&para;<br>must speak so explicitly in order to convey its intent to&para;<br>preclude arbitration of statutory claims. We have never&para;<br>said as much, and on numerous occasions have held that&para;<br>proof of Congress’ intent may also be discovered in the&para;<br>history or purpose of the statute in question. See ibid. (“If&para;<br>such an intention exists, it will be discoverable in the text&para;<br>of the [statute], its legislative history, or an ‘inherent&para;<br>conflict’ between arbitration and the [statute’s] underlying&para;<br>purposes”); Shearson/American Express Inc. v.

S. C. §1679(a). Central&para;<br>to the legislation, Congress sought to arm consumers with&para;<br>information needed to make intelligent decisions about&para;<br>purchasing a repair organization’s services. To that end,&para;<br>Congress directed that, “before [execution of] any contract&para;<br>. . . between [a] consumer and [a] credit repair organiza­&para;<br>tion,” the organization must make certain disclosures.&para;<br>One of the required disclosures reads:&para;<br>“You have a right to sue a credit repair organization&para;<br>that violates the [CROA]. This law prohibits decep­&para;<br>tive practices by [such] organizations.” §1679c(a).&para;<br>The Act’s civil-liability provision describes suits consumers&para;<br>may bring in court: individual and class actions for dam­&para;<br>ages (actual and punitive) and attorneys’ fees. A further&para;<br>provision renders void any purported waiver of any protec­&para;<br>tion or right the Act grants to consumers.&para;<br>The Court today holds that credit repair organizations&para;<br>can escape suit by providing in their take-it-or-leave-it&para;<br>contracts that arbitration will serve as the parties’ sole&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>COMPUCREDIT CORP. v.

That&para;<br>reading may be comprehensible to one trained to “think&para;<br>like a lawyer.” But Congress enacted the CROA with&para;<br>vulnerable consumers in mind—consumers likely to read&para;<br>the words “right to sue” to mean the right to litigate in&para;<br>court, not the obligation to submit disputes to binding&para;<br>arbitration.&para;<br>In accord with the Ninth Circuit, I would hold that&para;<br>Congress, in an Act meant to curb deceptive practices, did&para;<br>not authorize credit repair organizations to make a false&para;<br>or misleading disclosure—telling consumers of a right they&para;<br>do not, in fact, possess.

In fact, plaintiffs asserted,&para;<br>they were charged an initial finance fee of $29, a monthly&para;<br>fee of $6.50, and an annual fee of $150, assessed immedi­&para;<br>ately against the $300 limit.

Congress dictated every word of the&para;<br>required notification. Credit repair organizations must&para;<br>tell consumers, in plain terms, how they may enforce their&para;<br>rights: “You have a right to sue a credit repair organiza­&para;<br>tion that violates the Credit Repair Organization Act.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>The “right to sue” refers to the claim for relief Congress&para;<br>afforded consumers in §1679g. “Any person” who violates&para;<br>another’s rights under the CROA “shall be liable” for&para;<br>actual damages and attorneys’ fees, and may be liable for&para;<br>punitive damages as well. §1679g(a)(1)–(3). The Act sets&para;<br>out the factors “the court shall consider” in determining&para;<br>the amount of punitive damages “the court may allow”&para;<br>aggrieved consumers to recover, either individually or as a&para;<br>class. §1679g(a)(2) and (b). The liability created here, in&para;<br>§1679g, is precisely what the consumer, in light of §1679c,&para;<br>may sue to enforce.&para;<br>The Act renders void and unenforceable “[a]ny waiver by&para;<br>any consumer of any protection provided by or any right of&para;<br>the consumer under this subchapter.” §1679f (emphasis&para;<br>added).3 The rights listed in §1679c(a) rendered nonwaivable by §1679f are the “right to sue” and the “right to&para;<br>cancel [a] contract . . . for any reason within 3 business&para;<br>days from the date [the consumer] signed it.”4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Section 1679f(a), omitted from the Court’s statutory appendix, ante,&para;<br>at 11–14, provides in full:&para;<br>“Any waiver by any consumer of any protection provided by or any&para;<br>right of the consumer under this subchapter—&para;<br>“(1) shall be treated as void; and&para;<br>“(2) may not be enforced by any Federal or State court or any other&para;<br>person.”&para;<br>4 Two provisions, although described by §1679c(a) as consumer&para;<br>“right[s],” are not rendered nonwaivable by §1679f because they are not&para;<br>“right[s] . . . under this subchapter.” Rather, the “right to dispute&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

Recall, as well, Con­&para;<br>gress’ findings that these individuals are often “of limited&para;<br>economic means and . . . inexperienced in credit matters.”&para;<br>§1679(a)(2). Attributing little importance to this context,&para;<br>the Court construes the right to sue as “the legal right,&para;<br>enforceable in court, to recover damages . . . without re­&para;<br>gard to whether the suit in court has to be preceded by an&para;<br>arbitration proceeding.” Ante, at 8. I read Congress’&para;<br>words without that sophisticated gloss: The right to sue,&para;<br>I would hold, means the right to litigate in court.&para;<br>The Court is quite right in recognizing that consumers&para;<br>“have the legal right, enforceable in court, to recover dam­&para;<br>ages from credit repair organizations that violate the&para;<br>CROA.” Ibid. But the Court is quite wrong, as I see it, to&para;<br>characterize as merely “imprecise,” ibid., Congress’ failure&para;<br>to include the caveat that access to court may be condi­&para;<br>tioned upon an anterior arbitration. The “right to sue”&para;<br>may well be “a colloquial method of communicating to&para;<br>consumers.” See ibid. But it surely is not colloquially&para;<br>understood by recipients of the required disclosures as the&para;<br>right, not to adjudicate in court, but only to seek, or defend&para;<br>against, court enforcement of an award rendered by the&para;<br>arbitrator chosen by the credit repair organization. Few,&para;<br>if any, credit repair customers would equate the “right to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>inaccurate information in your credit report” and the “right to obtain a&para;<br>copy of your credit report” referred to in §1679c(a) are rights conferred&para;<br>elsewhere in the U. S. Code. See §1681i(a), §1681j. Section 1679f also&para;<br>makes nonwaivable the “protection[s] provided . . . under this subchap­&para;<br>ter” (emphasis added); these protections include the prohibition of cer­&para;<br>tain business practices, see §1679b, and the provision, in writing, of&para;<br>certain contractual terms and conditions, see §1679d.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>COMPUCREDIT CORP. v.

L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576, 586–589&para;<br>(2008).&para;<br>The Court discounts the references to “action,” “class&para;<br>action,” and “court” in §1679g, the provision that “cre­&para;<br>ate[s]” the consumers’ claim for relief. See ante, at 5.&para;<br>Despite similar statutory language, the Court observes, we&para;<br>have enforced arbitration agreements to settle disputes&para;<br>arising under other Acts of Congress. The CROA, however, is distinguished by its disclosure requirements,&para;<br>prime among them, the obligation imposed on the credit&para;<br>repair organization to inform potential customers they&para;<br>“have a right to sue” an organization that violates the Act.&para;<br>§1679c(a). Yet the Court refuses to read this language in&para;<br>concert with §1679g, notwithstanding our frequent ac­&para;<br>knowledgment that “a statute is to be read as a whole,&para;<br>since the meaning of statutory language . . . depends on&para;<br>context.” King v. St. Vincent’s Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221&para;<br>(1991) (citation omitted). As just explained, I believe&para;<br>Congress meant what an ordinary reader of the disclosure&para;<br>requirement would likely comprehend: A credit repair&para;<br>organization that engages in deceptive practices may be&para;<br>sued in court.&para;<br>Reducing the required disclosure to insignificance, see&para;<br>ante, at 4–5, the Court’s construction of the CROA scarcely&para;<br>advances the Act’s goals. Congress aimed to ensure pro­&para;<br>spective customers “are provided with the information&para;<br>necessary to make an informed decision,” and also to&para;<br>“protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising&para;<br>and business practices.” 15 U. S. C. §1679(b). The Court’s&para;<br>interpretation, however, enables the very deception Con­&para;<br>gress sought to suppress.

The Court cites three decisions for the proposition,&para;<br>by now uncontroversial, that the mere existence of a statutory right of action does not preclude agreements to&para;<br>arbitrate disputes. See ante, at 5–6 (citing Gilmer v.&para;<br>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 28 (1991);&para;<br>Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U.

As&para;<br>the Court acknowledges, ante, at 6, none of the statutes at&para;<br>issue in those cases contained a nonwaiver clause analo­&para;<br>gous to §1679f. Yet the presence of such a clause would&para;<br>not have affected the outcome, the Court maintains; a&para;<br>nonwaiver provision would not have precluded arbitration&para;<br>because the statutes conferred no underlying right to&para;<br>proceed in court.&para;<br>Precisely the point: The CROA differs from the statutes&para;<br>we have construed in the past in just that respect. The&para;<br>Act does not merely create a claim for relief. It designates&para;<br>that claim as an action entailing a “right to sue”; man­&para;<br>dates that consumers be informed, prior to entering any&para;<br>contract, of that right; and precludes the waiver of any&para;<br>“right” conferred by the Act. Neither Gilmer, McMahon,&para;<br>nor Mitsubishi construed a statute of a similar order.5&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Court’s final point is that, elsewhere, Congress has&para;<br>spoken with particular clarity in guaranteeing a judicial&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 “[I]f one believes [the CROA] . . . establishes a nonwaivable right to&para;<br>initial judicial enforcement,” the Court states, “one must also believe&para;<br>that it establishes a nonwaivable right to initial judicial enforcement in&para;<br>any competent judicial tribunal.” Ante, at 7. In Sportin’ Life’s words,&para;<br>“it ain’t necessarily so.” While there is good reason to believe Congress&para;<br>cared about the institutional location of consumers’ suits under the&para;<br>CROA, there is no reason to think Congress sought to disturb the&para;<br>personal jurisdiction and venue rules that determine in which court a&para;<br>civil action may be brought.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>COMPUCREDIT CORP. v.
