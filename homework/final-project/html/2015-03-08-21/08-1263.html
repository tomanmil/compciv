FERNANDO &para;<br>&para;<br>BELMONTES, JR. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED&para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 08–1263. Decided November 16, 2009&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>In 1981, in the course of a burglary, Fernando Belmon&para;<br>tes bludgeoned Steacy McConnell to death, striking her in&para;<br>the head 15 to 20 times with a steel dumbbell bar. See&para;<br>People v. Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d 744, 759–761, 755 P. 2d&para;<br>310, 315–316 (1988). After the murder, Belmontes and his&para;<br>accomplices stole McConnell’s stereo, sold it for $100, and&para;<br>used the money to buy beer and drugs for the night. Id.,&para;<br>at 764–765, 755 P. 2d, at 318–319.&para;<br>Belmontes was convicted of murder and sentenced to&para;<br>death in state court. Unsuccessful on direct appeal and&para;<br>state collateral review, Belmontes sought federal habeas&para;<br>relief, which the District Court denied. The Court of Ap&para;<br>peals reversed, finding instructional error, but we over&para;<br>turned that decision. Ayers v. Belmontes, 549 U. S. 7&para;<br>(2006); see also Brown v. Belmontes, 544 U. S. 945 (2005).&para;<br>On remand, the Court of Appeals again ruled for Bel&para;<br>montes, this time finding that Belmontes suffered ineffec&para;<br>tive assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of&para;<br>his trial. The District Court had previously denied relief&para;<br>on that ground, finding that counsel for Belmontes had&para;<br>performed deficiently under Ninth Circuit precedent, but&para;<br>that Belmontes could not establish prejudice under Strick&para;<br>land v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Belmontes v.&para;<br>Calderon, Civ. S–89–0736 DFL JFM (ED Cal., Aug. 15,&para;<br>2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 140a, 179a, 183a. The Court&para;<br>of Appeals agreed that counsel’s performance was defi&para;<br>cient, but disagreed with the District Court with respect to&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WONG v. BELMONTES&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>prejudice, determining that counsel’s errors undermined&para;<br>confidence in the penalty phase verdict. Belmontes v.&para;<br>Ayers, 529 F. 3d 834, 859–863, 874 (CA9 2008). We dis&para;<br>agree with the Court of Appeals as to prejudice, grant the&para;<br>State’s petition for certiorari, and reverse.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Belmontes argues that his counsel was constitutionally&para;<br>ineffective for failing to investigate and present sufficient&para;<br>mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of his trial.&para;<br>To prevail on this claim, Belmontes must meet both the&para;<br>deficient performance and prejudice prongs of Strickland,&para;<br>466 U. S., at 687. To show deficient performance, Belmon&para;<br>tes must establish that “counsel’s representation fell below&para;<br>an objective standard of reasonableness.” Id., at 688. In&para;<br>light of “the variety of circumstances faced by defense&para;<br>counsel [and] the range of legitimate decisions regarding&para;<br>how best to represent a criminal defendant,” the perform&para;<br>ance inquiry necessarily turns on “whether counsel’s&para;<br>assistance was reasonable considering all the circum&para;<br>stances.” Id., at 688–689. At all points, “[j]udicial scru&para;<br>tiny of counsel’s performance must be highly deferential.”&para;<br>Id., at 689.&para;<br>The challenge confronting Belmontes’ lawyer, John&para;<br>Schick, was very specific. Substantial evidence indicated&para;<br>that Belmontes had committed a prior murder, and the&para;<br>prosecution was eager to introduce that evidence during&para;<br>the penalty phase of the McConnell trial. The evidence of&para;<br>the prior murder was extensive, including eyewitness&para;<br>testimony, Belmontes’ own admissions, and Belmontes’&para;<br>possession of the murder weapon and the same type of&para;<br>ammunition used to kill the victim. Record 2239–2250,&para;<br>2261; Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64 (Sept.&para;<br>26, 1995).&para;<br>The evidence, furthermore, was potentially devastating.&para;<br>It would have shown that two years before Steacy McCon&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>nell’s death, police found Jerry Howard’s body in a se&para;<br>cluded area. Howard had been killed execution style, with&para;<br>a bullet to the back of the head. The authorities suspected&para;<br>Belmontes, but on the eve of trial the State’s witnesses&para;<br>refused to cooperate (Belmontes’ mother had begged one&para;<br>not to testify). The prosecution therefore believed it could&para;<br>not prove Belmontes guilty of murder beyond a reasonable&para;<br>doubt. What the prosecution could prove, even without&para;<br>the recalcitrant witnesses, was that Belmontes possessed&para;<br>the gun used to murder Howard. So the State offered, and&para;<br>Belmontes accepted, a no-contest plea to accessory after&para;<br>the fact to voluntary manslaughter. Record 2239–2243;&para;<br>Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64.&para;<br>But Belmontes had not been shy about discussing the&para;<br>murder, boasting to several people that he had killed&para;<br>Howard. Steven Cartwright informed the district attorney&para;<br>that Belmontes had confessed to the murder. A police&para;<br>informant told detectives that Belmontes “bragged” about&para;<br>the murder, stating that he was “mad” at Howard because&para;<br>“the night before, he had quite a [lot] of dope and wouldn’t&para;<br>share it with him.” After double jeopardy protection set in&para;<br>and he had been released on parole, Belmontes admitted&para;<br>his responsibility for the murder to his counselor at the&para;<br>California Youth Authority, Charles Sapien. During his&para;<br>time in confinement, Belmontes had “always denied that&para;<br>he was the [one] who shot Jerry Howard.” But because&para;<br>Sapien “had been square with [Belmontes],” Belmontes&para;<br>decided to level with Sapien upon his release, telling&para;<br>Sapien that he had “ ‘wasted’ that guy.” Record 2240;&para;<br>Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64.&para;<br>Schick understood the gravity of this aggravating evi&para;<br>dence, and he built his mitigation strategy around the&para;<br>overriding need to exclude it. California evidentiary rules,&para;<br>Schick knew, offered him an argument to exclude the&para;<br>evidence, but those same rules made clear that the evi&para;<br>dence would come in for rebuttal if Schick opened the door.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>WONG v. BELMONTES&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Record 2256; see also People v. Rodriguez, 42 Cal. 3d 730,&para;<br>791–792, 726 P. 2d 113, 153 (1986); People v. Harris, 28&para;<br>Cal. 3d 935, 960–962, 623 P. 2d 240, 254 (1981). Schick&para;<br>thus had “grave concerns” that, even if he succeeded ini&para;<br>tially in excluding the prior murder evidence, it would still&para;<br>be admitted if his mitigation case swept too broadly.&para;<br>Accordingly, Schick decided to proceed cautiously, struc&para;<br>turing his mitigation arguments and witnesses to limit&para;<br>that possibility. Deposition of John Schick 301, 309–310;&para;<br>see Strickland, supra, at 699 (“Restricting testimony on&para;<br>respondent’s character to what had come in at the plea&para;<br>colloquy ensured that contrary character and psychologi&para;<br>cal evidence and respondent’s criminal history, which&para;<br>counsel had successfully moved to exclude, would not come&para;<br>in”).&para;<br>As Schick expected, the prosecution was ready to admit&para;<br>this evidence during the sentencing phase. Schick moved&para;<br>to exclude the evidence, arguing that the State should be&para;<br>allowed to tell the jury only that Belmontes had been&para;<br>convicted of being an accessory after the fact to voluntary&para;<br>manslaughter—nothing more. Record 2240–2254. Schick&para;<br>succeeded in keeping the prosecution from presenting the&para;<br>damaging evidence in its sentencing case in chief, but his&para;<br>client remained at risk: The trial court indicated the evi&para;<br>dence would come in for rebuttal or impeachment if Schick&para;<br>opened the door. Id., at 2256.&para;<br>This was not an empty threat. In one instance, Schick&para;<br>elicited testimony that Belmontes was not a violent per&para;<br>son. The State objected and, out of earshot of the jury,&para;<br>argued that it should be able to rebut the testimony with&para;<br>the Howard murder evidence. Id., at 2332–2334. The&para;<br>Court warned Schick that it was “going to have to allow&para;<br>[the prosecution] to go into the whole background” if&para;<br>Schick continued his line of questioning. Id., at 2334.&para;<br>Schick acquiesced, and the court struck the testimony.&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>The Court’s warning reinforced Schick’s understanding&para;<br>that he would have to tailor his mitigation case carefully&para;<br>to preserve his success in excluding the Howard murder&para;<br>evidence. With that cautionary note in mind, Schick put&para;<br>on nine witnesses he thought could advance a case for&para;<br>mitigation, without opening the door to the prior murder&para;<br>evidence. See id., at 2312–2417.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals determined that in spite of these&para;<br>efforts, Schick’s performance was constitutionally deficient&para;<br>under Circuit precedent. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 862–&para;<br>863. The State challenges that conclusion, but we need&para;<br>not resolve the point, because we agree with the District&para;<br>Court that Belmontes cannot establish prejudice.&para;<br>II&para;<br>To establish prejudice, Belmontes must show “a reason&para;<br>able probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional&para;<br>errors, the result of the proceeding would have been dif&para;<br>ferent.” Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. That showing&para;<br>requires Belmontes to establish “a reasonable probability&para;<br>that a competent attorney, aware of [the available mitigat&para;<br>ing evidence], would have introduced it at sentencing,”&para;<br>and “that had the jury been confronted with this . . . miti&para;<br>gating evidence, there is a reasonable probability that it&para;<br>would have returned with a different sentence.” Wiggins&para;<br>v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 535, 536 (2003).&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit determined that a reasonably compe&para;<br>tent lawyer would have introduced more mitigation evi&para;<br>dence, on top of what Schick had already presented. For&para;<br>purposes of our prejudice analysis, we accept that conclu&para;<br>sion and proceed to consider whether there is a reasonable&para;<br>probability that a jury presented with this additional miti&para;<br>gation evidence would have returned a different verdict.&para;<br>In evaluating that question, it is necessary to consider&para;<br>all the relevant evidence that the jury would have had&para;<br>before it if Schick had pursued the different path—not just&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>WONG v. BELMONTES&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>the mitigation evidence Schick could have presented, but&para;<br>also the Howard murder evidence that almost certainly&para;<br>would have come in with it. See Strickland, supra, at&para;<br>695–696, 700. Thus, to establish prejudice, Belmontes&para;<br>must show a reasonable probability that the jury would&para;<br>have rejected a capital sentence after it weighed the entire&para;<br>body of mitigating evidence (including the additional&para;<br>testimony Schick could have presented) against the entire&para;<br>body of aggravating evidence (including the Howard mur&para;<br>der evidence). Belmontes cannot meet this burden.&para;<br>We begin with the mitigating evidence Schick did pre&para;<br>sent during the sentencing phase. That evidence was&para;<br>substantial. The same Ninth Circuit panel addressing the&para;<br>same record in Belmontes’ first habeas appeal agreed,&para;<br>recognizing “the substantial nature of the mitigating&para;<br>evidence” Schick presented. Belmontes v. Woodford, 350&para;<br>F. 3d 861, 907 (2003). It reiterated the point several&para;<br>times. See id., at 874, 901, 908.&para;<br>All told, Schick put nine witnesses on the stand over a&para;<br>span of two days, and elicited a range of testimony on&para;<br>Belmontes’ behalf. A number of those witnesses high&para;<br>lighted Belmontes’ “terrible” childhood. They testified&para;<br>that his father was an alcoholic and extremely abusive.&para;<br>Belmontes’ grandfather described the one-bedroom house&para;<br>where Belmontes spent much of his childhood as a&para;<br>“chicken coop.” Belmontes did not do well in school; he&para;<br>dropped out in the ninth grade. His younger sister died&para;<br>when she was only 10 months old. And his grandmother&para;<br>died tragically when she drowned in her swimming pool.&para;<br>See Record 2314–2319, 2324–2325, 2344.&para;<br>Family members also testified that, despite these diffi&para;<br>culties, Belmontes maintained strong relationships with&para;<br>his grandfather, grandmother, mother, and sister. Id., at&para;<br>2317–2318, 2325–2326. And Belmontes’ best friend of&para;<br>fered the insights of a close friend and confidant. Id., at&para;<br>2329–2332.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Schick also called witnesses who detailed Belmontes’&para;<br>religious conversion while in state custody on the acces&para;<br>sory charge. These witnesses told stories about Belmon&para;<br>tes’ efforts advising other inmates in his detention center’s&para;<br>religious program, to illustrate that he could live a produc&para;<br>tive and meaningful life in prison. They described his&para;<br>success working as part of a firefighting crew, detailing his&para;<br>rise from lowest man on the team to second in command.&para;<br>Belmontes’ assistant chaplain even said that he would use&para;<br>Belmontes as a regular part of his prison counseling pro&para;<br>gram if the jury handed down a life sentence. Id., at&para;<br>2379–2384, 2396–2398, 2400–2407.&para;<br>Belmontes himself bolstered these accounts by testifying&para;<br>about his childhood and religious conversion, both at&para;<br>sentencing and during allocution. Belmontes described&para;<br>his childhood as “pretty hard,” but took responsibility for&para;<br>his actions, telling the jury that he did not want to use his&para;<br>background “as a crutch[,] to say I am in a situation now&para;<br>. . . because of that.” Id., at 2343.&para;<br>On remand from this Court, the Court of Appeals—&para;<br>addressing Belmontes’ ineffective assistance claim for the&para;<br>first time—changed its view of this evidence. Instead of&para;<br>finding Schick’s mitigation case “substantial,” as it previ&para;<br>ously had, Belmontes, 350 F. 3d, at 907, the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>this time around labeled it “cursory,” Belmontes, 529 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 841, 861, n. 14, 866. Compare also Belmontes, 350&para;<br>F. 3d, at 874, 901, 907 (labeling the mitigation evidence&para;<br>Schick presented “substantial”), with Belmontes, 529&para;<br>F. 3d, at 847, n. 3, 874 (labeling the same evidence “insub&para;<br>stantial”). More evidence, the Court of Appeals now con&para;<br>cluded, would have made a difference; in particular, more&para;<br>evidence to “humanize” Belmontes, as that court put it no&para;<br>fewer than 11 times in its opinion. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 850, 859, 860, 862, 863, 864, 865, and n. 18, 869, 872,&para;<br>874. The Court determined that the failure to put on this&para;<br>evidence prejudiced Belmontes.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>WONG v. BELMONTES&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>There are two problems with this conclusion: Some of&para;<br>the evidence was merely cumulative of the humanizing&para;<br>evidence Schick actually presented; adding it to what was&para;<br>already there would have made little difference. Other&para;<br>evidence proposed by the Ninth Circuit would have put&para;<br>into play aspects of Belmontes’ character that would have&para;<br>triggered admission of the powerful Howard evidence in&para;<br>rebuttal. This evidence would have made a difference, but&para;<br>in the wrong direction for Belmontes. In either event,&para;<br>Belmontes cannot establish Strickland prejudice.&para;<br>First, the cumulative evidence. In the Court of Appeals’&para;<br>view, Belmontes should have presented more humanizing&para;<br>evidence about Belmontes’ “difficult childhood” and high&para;<br>lighted his “positive attributes.” 529 F. 3d, at 864. As for&para;<br>his difficult childhood, Schick should have called witnesses&para;<br>to testify that “when Belmontes was five years old, his 10&para;<br>month-old sister died of a brain tumor,” that he “exhibited&para;<br>symptoms of depression” after her death, that his grand&para;<br>mother suffered from “alcoholism and prescription drug&para;<br>addiction,” and that both his immediate and extended&para;<br>family lived in a state of “constant strife.” Ibid. As for his&para;<br>positive attributes, Schick should have produced testi&para;<br>mony about Belmontes’ “strong character as a child in the&para;<br>face of adversity.” Ibid. Schick should have illustrated&para;<br>that Belmontes was “kind, responsible, and likeable”; that&para;<br>he “got along well with his siblings” and was “respectful&para;<br>towards his grandparents despite their disapproval of his&para;<br>mixed racial background”; and that he “participated in&para;<br>community activities, kept up in school and got along with&para;<br>his teachers before [an] illness, and made friends easily.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>But as recounted above and recognized by the state&para;<br>courts and, originally, this very panel, Schick did put on&para;<br>substantial mitigation evidence, much of it targeting the&para;<br>same “humanizing” theme the Ninth Circuit highlighted.&para;<br>Compare, e.g., ibid., with Record 2317 (death of 10-month&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>old sister); id., at 2319, 2325 (difficult childhood); id., at&para;<br>2314–2315 (family member’s addictions); id., at 2314–&para;<br>2315, 2324–2325 (family strife and abuse); id., at 2317,&para;<br>2319, 2347–2348, 2397 (strong character as a child); id., at&para;<br>2326–2327 (close relationship with siblings); id., at 2317–&para;<br>2319 (close relationship with grandparents); id., at 2348–&para;<br>2351 (participation in community religious events); see&para;<br>also, e.g., Belmontes’ Traverse to Respondent’s Return to&para;<br>Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. 5–89–0736–EJG–&para;<br>JFM (ED Cal.), p. 64 (“[C]ounsel’s presentation was ar&para;<br>guably adequate only with respect to [evidence] of ‘human&para;<br>izing’ petitioner”). The sentencing jury was thus “well&para;<br>acquainted” with Belmontes’ background and potential&para;<br>humanizing features. Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465,&para;<br>481 (2007). Additional evidence on these points would&para;<br>have offered an insignificant benefit, if any at all.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit also determined that both the evi&para;<br>dence Schick presented and the additional evidence it&para;<br>proposed would have carried greater weight if Schick had&para;<br>submitted expert testimony. Such testimony could “make&para;<br>connections between the various themes in the mitigation&para;<br>case and explain to the jury how they could have contrib&para;<br>uted to Belmontes’s involvement in criminal activity.”&para;<br>Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 853. See also ibid. (discussing&para;<br>expert’s federal habeas testimony on importance of expert&para;<br>testimony). But the body of mitigating evidence the Ninth&para;<br>Circuit would have required Schick to present was neither&para;<br>complex nor technical. It required only that the jury make&para;<br>logical connections of the kind a layperson is well&para;<br>equipped to make. The jury simply did not need expert&para;<br>testimony to understand the “humanizing” evidence; it&para;<br>could use its common sense or own sense of mercy.&para;<br>What is more, expert testimony discussing Belmontes’&para;<br>mental state, seeking to explain his behavior, or putting it&para;<br>in some favorable context would have exposed Belmontes&para;<br>to the Howard evidence. See Darden v. Wainwright, 477&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>WONG v. BELMONTES&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>U. S. 168, 186 (1986) (“Any attempt to portray petitioner&para;<br>as a nonviolent man would have opened the door for the&para;<br>State to rebut with evidence of petitioner’s prior convic&para;<br>tions. . . . Similarly, if defense counsel had attempted to&para;<br>put on evidence that petitioner was a family man, they&para;<br>would have been faced with his admission at trial that,&para;<br>although still married, he was spending the weekend&para;<br>furlough with a girlfriend”).&para;<br>If, for example, an expert had testified that Belmontes&para;<br>had a “ ‘high likelihood of a . . . nonviolent adjustment to a&para;<br>prison setting,’ ” as Belmontes suggested an expert might,&para;<br>see Brief for Appellant in No. 01–99018 (CA9), p. 34, the&para;<br>question would have immediately arisen: “What was his&para;<br>propensity toward violence to begin with? Does evidence&para;<br>of another murder alter your view?” Expert testimony&para;<br>explaining why the jury should feel sympathy, as opposed&para;<br>simply to facts that might elicit that response, would have&para;<br>led to a similar rejoinder: “Is such sympathy equally ap&para;<br>propriate for someone who committed a second murder?”&para;<br>Any of this testimony from an expert’s perspective would&para;<br>have made the Howard evidence fair game.&para;<br>Many of Belmontes’ other arguments fail for the same&para;<br>reason. He argues that the jury should have been told&para;<br>that he suffered an “extended bout with rheumatic fever,”&para;<br>which led to “emotional instability, impulsivity, and im&para;<br>pairment of the neurophysiological mechanisms for plan&para;<br>ning and reasoning.” Amended Pet. for Writ of Habeas&para;<br>Corpus 120. But the cold, calculated nature of the Howard&para;<br>murder and Belmontes’ subsequent bragging about it&para;<br>would have served as a powerful counterpoint.&para;<br>The type of “more-evidence-is-better” approach advo&para;<br>cated by Belmontes and the Court of Appeals might seem&para;<br>appealing—after all, what is there to lose? But here there&para;<br>was a lot to lose. A heavyhanded case to portray Belmon&para;<br>tes in a positive light, with or without experts, would have&para;<br>invited the strongest possible evidence in rebuttal—the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>evidence that Belmontes was responsible for not one but&para;<br>two murders.&para;<br>Belmontes counters that some of the potential mitigat&para;<br>ing evidence might not have opened the door to the prior&para;<br>murder evidence. The Court of Appeals went so far as to&para;<br>state, without citation, that “[t]here would be no basis for&para;<br>suggesting that [expert testimony] would be any different&para;<br>if the expert were informed that Belmontes committed two&para;<br>murders rather than one.” Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 869,&para;<br>n. 20. But it is surely pertinent in assessing expert testi&para;<br>mony “explain[ing] . . . involvement in criminal activity,”&para;<br>id., at 853, to know what criminal activity was at issue.&para;<br>And even if the number of murders were as irrelevant as&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit asserted, the fact that these two murders&para;<br>were so different in character made each of them highly&para;<br>pertinent in evaluating expert testimony of the sort envi&para;<br>sioned by the Court of Appeals.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit noted that the trial court retained&para;<br>discretion to exclude the Howard evidence even if Schick&para;<br>opened the door. Id., at 869–870, n. 20. If Schick had&para;<br>doubts, the Court of Appeals contended, he could have&para;<br>secured an answer in advance through a motion in limine.&para;<br>Ibid. The trial judge, however, left little doubt where he&para;<br>stood. While ruling that the prosecution could not present&para;<br>the evidence in its case in chief, Record 2254, the judge&para;<br>made clear that it would come in for certain rebuttal&para;<br>purposes, id., at 2256, 2332–2334. When Schick elicited&para;<br>testimony that Belmontes was not violent, for example,&para;<br>the judge ordered it stricken and warned Schick that he&para;<br>would admit the Howard murder evidence—to let the&para;<br>prosecution “go into the whole background”—if Schick&para;<br>pressed forward. Id., at 2334.&para;<br>In balancing the mitigating factors against the aggrava&para;<br>tors, the Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to the ag&para;<br>gravating evidence the State presented as “scant.” Bel&para;<br>montes, 529 F. 3d, at 870, 873, 874, 875, 878. That&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>WONG v. BELMONTES&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>characterization misses Strickland’s point that the review&para;<br>ing court must consider all the evidence—the good and the&para;<br>bad—when evaluating prejudice. See Strickland, 466&para;<br>U. S., at 695–696, 700. Here, the worst kind of bad evi&para;<br>dence would have come in with the good. The only reason&para;<br>it did not was because Schick was careful in his mitigation&para;<br>case.

Belmontes v. Ayers, 551&para;<br>F. 3d 864, 867 (CA9 2008) (Callahan, J., dissenting from&para;<br>denial of rehearing en banc).&para;<br>Even on the record before it—which did not include the&para;<br>Howard murder—the state court determined that Belmon&para;<br>tes “was convicted on extremely strong evidence that he&para;<br>committed an intentional murder of extraordinary brutal&para;<br>ity.” Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d, at 819, 755 P. 2d, at 354.&para;<br>That court also noted that “[t]he properly admitted aggra&para;<br>vating evidence in this case—in particular, the circum&para;<br>stances of the crime—was simply overwhelming.” Id., at&para;<br>809, 755 P. 2d, at 348 (citation omitted). The Ninth Cir&para;<br>cuit saw the murder differently. It viewed the circum&para;<br>stances of the crime as only “conceivably significant” as an&para;<br>aggravating factor. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 871. In&para;<br>particular, the Court of Appeals concluded that “[t]he&para;<br>crime here did not involve . . . needless suffering on the&para;<br>part of the victim.” Ibid.&para;<br>We agree with the state court’s characterization of the&para;<br>murder, and simply cannot comprehend the assertion by&para;<br>the Court of Appeals that this case did not involve “need&para;<br>less suffering.” The jury saw autopsy photographs show&para;<br>ing Steacy McConnell’s mangled head, her skull crushed&para;<br>by 15 to 20 blows from a steel dumbbell bar the jury found&para;<br>to have been wielded by Belmontes. McConnell’s corpse&para;<br>showed numerous “defensive bruises and contusions on&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

Belmontes left&para;<br>McConnell to die, but officers found her still fighting for&para;<br>her life before ultimately succumbing to the injuries&para;<br>caused by the blows from Belmontes.

The jury&para;<br>also heard that this savage murder was committed solely&para;<br>to prevent interference with a burglary that netted Bel&para;<br>montes $100 he used to buy beer and drugs for the night.&para;<br>McConnell suffered, and it was clearly needless.&para;<br>Some of the error below may be traced to confusion&para;<br>about the appropriate standard and burden of proof.&para;<br>While the Court of Appeals quoted the pertinent language&para;<br>from Strickland, that court elsewhere suggested it might&para;<br>have applied something different. In explaining its preju&para;<br>dice determination, the Ninth Circuit concluded that “[t]he&para;<br>aggravating evidence, even with the addition of evidence&para;<br>that Belmontes murdered Howard, is not strong enough,&para;<br>in light of the mitigating evidence that could have been&para;<br>adduced, to rule out a sentence of life in prison.” Belmon&para;<br>tes, 529 F. 3d, at 875. But Strickland does not require the&para;<br>State to “rule out” a sentence of life in prison to prevail.&para;<br>Rather, Strickland places the burden on the defendant,&para;<br>not the State, to show a “reasonable probability” that the&para;<br>result would have been different. 466 U. S., at 694. Un&para;<br>der a proper application of the Strickland standard, Bel&para;<br>montes cannot carry this burden.&para;<br>It is hard to imagine expert testimony and additional&para;<br>facts about Belmontes’ difficult childhood outweighing the&para;<br>facts of McConnell’s murder. It becomes even harder to&para;<br>envision such a result when the evidence that Belmontes&para;<br>had committed another murder—“the most powerful&para;<br>imaginable aggravating evidence,” as Judge Levi put it,&para;<br>Belmontes, S-89–0736, App. to Pet. for Cert. 183a—is&para;<br>added to the mix. Schick’s mitigation strategy failed, but&para;<br>the notion that the result could have been different if only&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>WONG v. BELMONTES&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Schick had put on more than the nine witnesses he did, or&para;<br>called expert witnesses to bolster his case, is fanciful.&para;<br>The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to&para;<br>proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of&para;<br>the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and&para;<br>the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent&para;<br>with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

See Ayers v. Belmontes, 549 U. S. 7,&para;<br>27 (2006) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). The trial judge who&para;<br>presided at Belmontes’ sentencing hearing so understood&para;<br>the law, and his instructions to the jury reflected that&para;<br>understanding. See id., at 33–34. It was only later that&para;<br>both the California Supreme Court and this Court&para;<br>squarely held that a jury must be allowed to give weight to&para;<br>any aspect of a defendant’s character or history that may&para;<br>provide a basis for a sentence other than death, even if&para;<br>such evidence does not “ ‘tend to reduce the defendant’s&para;<br>culpability for his crime.’ ” Id., at 28 (quoting Skipper v.&para;<br>South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 11 (1986) (Powell, J., concur&para;<br>ring in judgment)).&para;<br>The testimony adduced at Belmontes’ sentencing hear&para;<br>ing described his religious conversion and his positive&para;<br>contributions to a youth rehabilitation program. Neither&para;<br>his own testimony, nor that of the two ministers and the&para;<br>other witnesses who testified on his behalf, made any&para;<br>attempt to extenuate the severity of his crime. Their&para;<br>testimony did, however, afford the jury a principled basis&para;<br>for imposing a sentence other than death. See Ayers, 549&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Cal.

A review of the&para;<br>entire record, especially the colloquy between six jurors&para;<br>and the trial judge, makes it clear to me that “the jury&para;<br>believed that the law forbade it from giving that evidence&para;<br>any weight at all.” Id., at 36–39. I therefore remain con&para;<br>vinced that in its initial review of this case, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals correctly set aside Belmontes’ death sentence.&para;<br>The narrow question that is now before us is whether&para;<br>the additional mitigating evidence that trial counsel failed&para;<br>to uncover would have persuaded the jury to return a&para;<br>different verdict. The evidence trial counsel might have&para;<br>presented hardly matters, however, because in my view&para;<br>the conscientious jurors’ mistaken understanding of the&para;<br>law would have prevented them from giving that addi&para;<br>tional evidence “any weight at all,” id., at 39, let alone&para;<br>controlling weight. Despite my strong disagreement with&para;<br>the Court’s decision to review this case once again, I nev&para;<br>ertheless agree with the Court’s conclusion that trial&para;<br>counsel’s failure to present additional mitigating evidence&para;<br>probably did not affect the outcome of the trial.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
