SERVICE EMPLOYEES &para;<br>&para;<br>INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 1000 &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–1121. Argued January 10, 2012—Decided June 21, 2012&para;<br>California law permits public-sector employees in a bargaining unit to&para;<br>decide by majority vote to create an “agency shop” arrangement under which all the employees are represented by a union. Even employees who do not join the union must pay an annual fee for&para;<br>“chargeable expenses,” i.e., the cost of nonpolitical union services related to collective bargaining. Under Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431&para;<br>U. S. 209, a public-sector union can bill nonmembers for chargeable&para;<br>expenses but may not require them to fund its political or ideological&para;<br>projects. Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292, 302–311, sets out requirements that a union must meet in order to collect regular fees&para;<br>from nonmembers without violating their rights.&para;<br>In June 2005, respondent, a public-sector union (SEIU), sent to&para;<br>California employees its annual Hudson notice, setting and capping&para;<br>monthly dues and estimating that 56.35% of its total expenditures in&para;<br>the coming year would be chargeable expenses. A nonmember had 30&para;<br>days to object to full payment of dues but would still have to pay the&para;<br>chargeable portion. The notice stated that the fee was subject to increase without further notice. That same month, the Governor called&para;<br>for a special election on, inter alia, two ballot propositions opposed by&para;<br>the SEIU. After the 30-day objection period ended, the SEIU sent a&para;<br>letter to unit employees announcing a temporary 25% increase in&para;<br>dues and a temporary elimination of the monthly dues cap, billing&para;<br>the move as an “Emergency Temporary Assessment to Build a Political Fight-Back Fund.” The purpose of the fund was to help achieve&para;<br>the union’s political objectives in the special election and in the upcoming November 2006 election. The union noted that the fund&para;<br>would be used “for a broad range of political expenses, including tele-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>vision and radio advertising, direct mail, voter registration, voter education, and get out the vote activities in our work sites and in our&para;<br>communities across California.” Nonunion employees were not given&para;<br>any choice as to whether they would pay into the fund.&para;<br>Petitioners, on behalf of nonunion employees who paid into the&para;<br>fund, brought a class action against the SEIU alleging violation of&para;<br>their First Amendment rights. The Federal District Court granted&para;<br>petitioners summary judgment. Ruling that the special assessment&para;<br>was for entirely political purposes, it ordered the SEIU to send a new&para;<br>notice giving class members 45 days to object and to provide those&para;<br>who object a full refund of contributions to the fund. The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that Hudson prescribed a balancing test&para;<br>under which the proper inquiry is whether the SEIU’s procedures&para;<br>reasonably accommodated the interests of the union, the employer,&para;<br>and the nonmember employees.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. This case is not moot. Although the SEIU offered a full refund to&para;<br>all class members after certiorari was granted, a live controversy remains. The voluntary cessation of challenged conduct does not ordinarily render a case moot because that conduct could be resumed as&para;<br>soon as the case is dismissed. See City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283, 289. Since the SEIU continues to defend the&para;<br>fund’s legality, it would not necessarily refrain from collecting similar&para;<br>fees in the future. Even if concerns about voluntary cessation were&para;<br>inapplicable because petitioners did not seek prospective relief, there&para;<br>would still be a live controversy as to the adequacy of the refund notice the SEIU sent pursuant to the District Court’s order. Pp. 6−8.&para;<br>2. Under the First Amendment, when a union imposes a special assessment or dues increase levied to meet expenses that were not disclosed when the regular assessment was set, it must provide a fresh&para;<br>notice and may not exact any funds from nonmembers without their&para;<br>affirmative consent. Pp. 8−23.&para;<br>(a) A close connection exists between this Nation’s commitment&para;<br>to self-government and the rights protected by the First Amendment,&para;<br>see, e.g., Brown v. Hartlage, 456 U. S. 45, 52−53, which creates “an&para;<br>open marketplace” in which differing ideas about political, economic,&para;<br>and social issues can compete freely for public acceptance without&para;<br>improper government interference, New York State Bd. of Elections v.&para;<br>Lopez Torres, 552 U. S 196, 202. The government may not prohibit&para;<br>the dissemination of ideas it disfavors, nor compel the endorsement&para;<br>of ideas that it approves. See, e.g., R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377,&para;<br>382. And the ability of like-minded individuals to associate for the&para;<br>purpose of expressing commonly held views may not be curtailed.&para;<br>See, e.g., Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 623. Close-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ly related to compelled speech and compelled association is compelled&para;<br>funding of the speech of private speakers or groups. Compulsory&para;<br>subsidies for private speech are thus subject to exacting First&para;<br>Amendment scrutiny and cannot be sustained unless, first, there is a&para;<br>comprehensive regulatory scheme involving a “mandated association”&para;<br>among those who are required to pay the subsidy, United States v.&para;<br>United Foods, Inc., 533 U. S. 405, and, second, compulsory fees are&para;<br>levied only insofar as they are a “necessary incident” of the “larger&para;<br>regulatory purpose which justified the required association,” ibid.&para;<br>Pp. 8−10.&para;<br>(b) When a State establishes an “agency shop” that exacts compulsory union fees as a condition of public employment, “[t]he dissenting employee is forced to support financially an organization with&para;<br>whose principles and demands he may disagree.” Ellis v. Railway&para;<br>Clerks, 466 U. S. 435, 455. This form of compelled speech and association imposes a “significant impingement on First Amendment&para;<br>rights.” Ibid. The justification for permitting a union to collect fees&para;<br>from nonmembers—to prevent them from free-riding on the union’s&para;<br>efforts—is an anomaly. Similarly, requiring objecting nonmembers&para;<br>to opt out of paying the nonchargeable portion of union dues―rather&para;<br>than exempting them unless they opt in―represents a remarkable&para;<br>boon for unions, creating a risk that the fees nonmembers pay will be&para;<br>used to further political and ideological ends with which they do not&para;<br>agree. Thus, Hudson, far from calling for a balancing of rights or interests, made it clear that any procedure for exacting fees from unwilling contributors must be “carefully tailored to minimize the infringement” of free speech rights, 475 U. S. 302−303, and it cited&para;<br>cases holding that measures burdening the freedom of speech or association must serve a compelling interest and must not be significantly broader than necessary to serve that interest. Pp. 10−13.&para;<br>(c) There is no justification for the SEIU’s failure to provide a&para;<br>fresh Hudson notice. Hudson rests on the principle that nonmembers&para;<br>should not be required to fund a union’s political and ideological projects unless they choose to do so after having “a fair opportunity” to&para;<br>assess the impact of paying for nonchargeable union activities. 475&para;<br>U. S., at 303. The SEIU’s procedure cannot be considered to have&para;<br>met Hudson’s requirement that fee-collection procedures be carefully&para;<br>tailored to minimize impingement on First Amendment rights. The&para;<br>SEIU argues that nonmembers who objected to the special assessment but were not given the opportunity to opt out would have been&para;<br>given the chance to recover the funds by opting out when the next&para;<br>annual notice was sent, and that the amount of dues payable the following year by objecting nonmembers would decrease if the special&para;<br>assessment were found to be for nonchargeable purposes. But this&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>decrease would not fully recompense nonmembers, who would not&para;<br>have paid to support the special assessment if given the choice. In&para;<br>any event, even a full refund would not undo the First Amendment&para;<br>violations, since the First Amendment does not permit a union to extract a loan from unwilling nonmembers even if the money is later&para;<br>paid back in full. Pp. 14−17.&para;<br>(d) The SEIU’s treatment of nonmembers who opted out when&para;<br>the initial Hudson notice was sent also ran afoul of the First&para;<br>Amendment. They were required to pay 56.35% of the special assessment even though all the money was slated for nonchargeable,&para;<br>electoral uses. And the SEIU’s claim that the assessment was a&para;<br>windfall because chargeable expenses turned out to be 66.26% is unpersuasive. First, the SEIU’s understanding of the breadth of&para;<br>chargeable expenses is so expansive that it is hard to place much reliance on its statistics. “Lobbying the electorate,” which the SEIU&para;<br>claims is chargeable, is nothing more than another term for supporting political causes and candidates. Second, even if the SEIU’s statistics are accurate, it does not follow that it was proper to charge objecting nonmembers any particular percentage of the special&para;<br>assessment. If, as the SEIU argues, it is not possible to accurately&para;<br>determine in advance the percentage of union funds that will be used&para;<br>for an upcoming year’s chargeable purposes, there is a risk that unconsenting nonmembers will have paid too much or too little. That&para;<br>risk should be borne by the side whose constitutional rights are not&para;<br>at stake. If the nonmembers pay too much, their First Amendment&para;<br>rights are infringed. But, if they pay too little, no constitutional right&para;<br>of the union is violated because it has no constitutional right to receive any payment from those employees.

SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 1000&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[June 21, 2012] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>In this case, we decide whether the First Amendment&para;<br>allows a public-sector union to require objecting nonmembers to pay a special fee for the purpose of financing the&para;<br>union’s political and ideological activities.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Under California law, public-sector employees in a&para;<br>bargaining unit may decide by majority vote to create an&para;<br>“agency shop” arrangement under which all the employees&para;<br>are represented by a union selected by the majority. Cal.&para;<br>Govt. Code Ann. §3502.5(a) (West 2010). While employees&para;<br>in the unit are not required to join the union, they must&para;<br>nevertheless pay the union an annual fee to cover the cost&para;<br>of union services related to collective bargaining (so-called&para;<br>chargeable expenses). See Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn.,&para;<br>500 U. S. 507, 524 (1991); Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S.&para;<br>740, 760 (1961).&para;<br>Our prior cases have recognized that such arrangements&para;<br>represent an “impingement” on the First Amendment&para;<br>rights of nonmembers. Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U. S. 292,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>307, n. 20 (1986). See also Davenport v. Washington Ed.&para;<br>Assn., 551 U. S. 177, 181 (2007) (“[A]gency-shop arrangements in the public sector raise First Amendment concerns because they force individuals to contribute money&para;<br>to unions as a condition of government employment”);&para;<br>Street, supra, at 749 (union shop presents First Amendment “questions of the utmost gravity”). Thus, in Abood v.&para;<br>Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977), we held that a&para;<br>public-sector union, while permitted to bill nonmembers&para;<br>for chargeable expenses, may not require nonmembers to&para;<br>fund its political and ideological projects. And in Hudson,&para;<br>we identified procedural requirements that a union must&para;<br>meet in order to collect fees from nonmembers without&para;<br>violating their rights. 475 U. S., at 302–311. The First&para;<br>Amendment, we held, does not permit a public-sector&para;<br>union to adopt procedures that have the effect of requiring&para;<br>objecting nonmembers to lend the union money to be used&para;<br>for political, ideological, and other purposes not germane&para;<br>to collective bargaining. Id., at 305. In the interest of&para;<br>administrative convenience, however, we concluded that&para;<br>a union “cannot be faulted” for calculating the fee that&para;<br>nonmembers must pay “on the basis of its expenses during&para;<br>the preceding year.” Id., at 307, n. 18.&para;<br>Hudson concerned a union’s regular annual fees. The&para;<br>present case, by contrast, concerns the First Amendment&para;<br>requirements applicable to a special assessment or dues&para;<br>increase that is levied to meet expenses that were not&para;<br>disclosed when the amount of the regular assessment was&para;<br>set.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In June 2005, respondent, the Service Employees International Union, Local 1000 (SEIU), sent out its regular&para;<br>Hudson notice informing employees what the agency fee&para;<br>would be for the year ahead. The notice set monthly dues&para;<br>at 1% of an employee’s gross monthly salary but capped&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>monthly dues at $45. Based on the most recently audited&para;<br>year, the SEIU estimated that 56.35% of its total expenditures in the coming year would be dedicated to chargeable&para;<br>collective-bargaining activities. Thus, if a nonunion employee objected within 30 days to payment of the full&para;<br>amount of union dues, the objecting employee was required to pay only 56.35% of total dues. The SEIU’s notice&para;<br>also included a feature that was not present in Hudson:&para;<br>The notice stated that the agency fee was subject to increase at any time without further notice.&para;<br>During this time, the citizens of the State of California&para;<br>were engaged in a wide-ranging political debate regarding&para;<br>state budget deficits, and in particular the budget consequences of growing compensation for public employees&para;<br>backed by powerful public-sector unions. On June 13,&para;<br>2005, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger called for a special&para;<br>election to be held in November 2005, where voters would&para;<br>consider various ballot propositions aimed at state-level&para;<br>structural reforms. Two of the most controversial issues&para;<br>on the ballot were Propositions 75 and 76. Proposition 75&para;<br>would have required unions to obtain employees’ affirmative consent before charging them fees to be used for political purposes. Proposition 76 would have limited state&para;<br>spending and would have given the Governor the ability&para;<br>under some circumstances to reduce state appropriations&para;<br>for public-employee compensation. The SEIU joined a&para;<br>coalition of public-sector unions in vigorously opposing&para;<br>these measures. Calling itself the “Alliance for a Better&para;<br>California,” the group would eventually raise “more than&para;<br>$10 million, with almost all of it coming from public employee unions, including $2.75 million from state worker&para;<br>unions, $4.7 million from the California Teachers Association, and $700,000 from school workers unions.”1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Marinucci &amp; Wildermuth, Schwarzenegger Adds Prop. 75 to His&para;<br>Agenda, San Francisco Chronicle, Sept. 18, 2005, p. A–17.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>On July 30, shortly after the end of the 30-day objection&para;<br>period for the June Hudson notice, the SEIU proposed a&para;<br>temporary 25% increase in employee fees, which it billed&para;<br>as an “Emergency Temporary Assessment to Build a Political Fight-Back Fund.” App. 25. The proposal stated&para;<br>that the money was needed to achieve the union’s political&para;<br>objectives, both in the special November 2005 election and&para;<br>in the November 2006 election. Id., at 26. According to&para;<br>the proposal, money in the Fight-Back Fund would be&para;<br>used “for a broad range of political expenses, including&para;<br>television and radio advertising, direct mail, voter registration, voter education, and get out the vote activities in&para;<br>our work sites and in our communities across California.”&para;<br>Ibid. The proposal specifically stated that “[t]he Fund will&para;<br>not be used for regular costs of the union—such as office&para;<br>rent, staff salaries or routine equipment replacement, etc.”&para;<br>Ibid. It noted that “all other public worker unions are in&para;<br>the process of raising the extraordinary funds needed to&para;<br>defeat the Governor.” Id., at 27. And it concluded: “Each&para;<br>of us must do our part to turn back these initiatives which&para;<br>would allow the Governor to destroy our wages and benefits and even our jobs, and threaten the well-being of all&para;<br>Californians.” Ibid. On August 27, the SEIU’s General&para;<br>Council voted to implement the proposal.&para;<br>On August 31, the SEIU sent out a letter addressed&para;<br>to “Local 1000 Members and Fair Share Fee Payers,” announcing that, for a limited period, their fees would be&para;<br>raised to 1.25% of gross monthly salary and the $45-permonth cap on regular dues would not apply. Id., at 31.&para;<br>The letter explained that the union would use the fund to&para;<br>“defeat Proposition 76 and Proposition 75 on November 8,”&para;<br>and to “defeat another attack on [its] pension plan” in&para;<br>June 2006. Ibid. The letter also informed employees that,&para;<br>in the following year, the money would help “to elect a&para;<br>governor and a legislature who support public employees&para;<br>and the services [they] provide.” Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>After receiving this letter, one of the plaintiffs in this&para;<br>case called the SEIU’s offices to complain that the union&para;<br>was levying the special assessment for political purposes&para;<br>without giving employees a fair opportunity to object.&para;<br>An SEIU area manager responded that “even if [the employee] objected to the payment of the full agency fee, there&para;<br>was nothing he could do about the September increase for&para;<br>the Assessment.” Knox v. Westly, No. 2:05–cv–02198, 2008&para;<br>WL 850128, *3 (ED Cal., Mar. 28, 2008). “She also stated&para;<br>that ‘we are in the fight of our lives,’ that the Assessment&para;<br>was needed, and that there was nothing that could be&para;<br>done to stop the Union’s expenditure of that Assessment&para;<br>for political purposes.” Ibid. As a consolation, however,&para;<br>those employees who had filed timely objections after the&para;<br>regular June Hudson notice were required to pay only&para;<br>56.35% of the temporary increase.&para;<br>Petitioners filed this class-action suit on behalf of 28,000&para;<br>nonunion employees who were forced to contribute money&para;<br>to the Political Fight-Back Fund. Some of the class members had filed timely objections after receiving the regular&para;<br>Hudson notice in June, and others had not. Those who&para;<br>had objected argued that it was wrong to require them to&para;<br>pay 56.35% of the temporary assessment, which had been&para;<br>billed as intended for use in making political expenditures&para;<br>that they found objectionable. Those who had not objected&para;<br>after receiving the June Hudson notice contended that&para;<br>they should have received a new opportunity to object&para;<br>when the SEIU levied the special assessment for its Political Fight-Back Fund.&para;<br>The District Court granted summary judgment for the&para;<br>petitioners, finding that the union “fully intended to use&para;<br>the 12 million additional dollars it anticipated to raise for&para;<br>political purposes.” 2008 WL 850128, *7. “Even if every&para;<br>cent of the assessment was not intended to be used for&para;<br>entirely political purposes,” the court stated, “it is clear&para;<br>that the Union’s intent was to depart drastically from its&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>typical spending regime and to focus on activities that&para;<br>were political or ideological in nature.” Id., at *8. In light&para;<br>of this fact, the court held that it would be inappropriate&para;<br>for the union to rely on previous annual expenditures to&para;<br>estimate that 56.35% of the new fee would go toward&para;<br>chargeable expenses. The court ordered the SEIU to send&para;<br>out a new notice giving all class members 45 days to object&para;<br>and to provide those who objected with a full refund of&para;<br>their contributions to the Political Fight-Back Fund. Id.,&para;<br>at *12.&para;<br>A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed. Knox&para;<br>v. California State Employees Assn., Local 1000, 628 F.&para;<br>3d 1115 (2010). According to the panel majority, Hudson&para;<br>prescribed the use of a balancing test. 628 F. 3d, at 1119–&para;<br>1120. The majority therefore inquired whether the procedure that the SEIU employed reasonably accommodated&para;<br>the interests of the union, the employer, and nonmember&para;<br>employees. Id., at 1120–1123. Judge Wallace dissented,&para;<br>arguing that the majority had misinterpreted Hudson and&para;<br>sanctioned the abridgment of the First Amendment rights&para;<br>of nonmembers. 628 F. 3d, at 1123–1139.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The SEIU argues that we should dismiss this case as&para;<br>moot. In opposing the petition for certiorari, the SEIU&para;<br>defended the decision below on the merits. After certiorari&para;<br>was granted, however, the union sent out a notice offering&para;<br>a full refund to all class members, and the union then&para;<br>promptly moved for dismissal of the case on the ground of&para;<br>mootness. Such postcertiorari maneuvers designed to&para;<br>insulate a decision from review by this Court must be&para;<br>viewed with a critical eye. See City News &amp; Novelty, Inc.&para;<br>v. Waukesha, 531 U. S. 278, 283–284 (2001). The voluntary cessation of challenged conduct does not ordinarily render a case moot because a dismissal for mootness&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>would permit a resumption of the challenged conduct as&para;<br>soon as the case is dismissed. See City of Mesquite v.&para;<br>Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U. S. 283, 289 (1982). And&para;<br>here, since the union continues to defend the legality of&para;<br>the Political Fight-Back fee, it is not clear why the union&para;<br>would necessarily refrain from collecting similar fees in&para;<br>the future.&para;<br>The union argues that concerns about voluntary cessation are inapplicable in this case because petitioners do&para;<br>not seek any prospective relief. See Motion to Dismiss as&para;<br>Moot 11–12. But even if that is so, the union’s mootness&para;<br>argument fails because there is still a live controversy as&para;<br>to the adequacy of the SEIU’s refund notice. A case becomes moot only when it is impossible for a court to grant&para;<br>“ ‘ “any effectual relief whatever” to the prevailing party.’ ”&para;<br>Erie v. Pap’s A. M., 529 U.

In particular, petitioners allege that the union has&para;<br>refused to accept refund requests by fax or e-mail and has&para;<br>made refunds conditional upon the provision of an original&para;<br>signature and a Social Security number. Id., at 18–19. As&para;<br>this dispute illustrates, the nature of the notice may affect&para;<br>how many employees who object to the union’s special&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>assessment will be able to get their money back. The&para;<br>union is not entitled to dictate unilaterally the manner in&para;<br>which it advertises the availability of the refund.&para;<br>For this reason, we conclude that a live controversy&para;<br>remains, and we proceed to the merits.&para;<br>III&para;<br>A&para;<br>Our cases have often noted the close connection between&para;<br>our Nation’s commitment to self-government and the&para;<br>rights protected by the First Amendment.

The&para;<br>special assessment in this case was billed for use in a&para;<br>broad electoral campaign designed to defeat two important&para;<br>and controversial ballot initiatives and to elect sympathetic candidates in the 2006 gubernatorial and legislative&para;<br>elections.

Thus, the effect of the SEIU’s procedure was to&para;<br>force many nonmembers to subsidize a political effort&para;<br>designed to restrict their own rights.&para;<br>As Hudson held, procedures for collecting fees from&para;<br>nonmembers must be carefully tailored to minimize impingement on First Amendment rights, and the procedure&para;<br>used in this case cannot possibly be considered to have&para;<br>met that standard. After the dues increase was adopted,&para;<br>the SEIU wrote to all employees in the relevant bargaining units to inform them of this development. It would&para;<br>have been a relatively simple matter for the union to cast&para;<br>this letter in the form of a new Hudson notice, so that&para;<br>nonmembers could decide whether they wanted to pay for&para;<br>the union’s electoral project.&para;<br>The SEIU argues that we should not be troubled by its&para;<br>failure to provide a new notice because nonmembers who&para;<br>objected to the special assessment but were nonetheless&para;<br>required to pay it would have been given the chance to&para;<br>recover the funds in question by opting out when the next&para;<br>annual notice was sent. If the special assessment was&para;<br>used entirely or in part for nonchargeable purposes, they&para;<br>suggest, the percentage of the union’s annual expenditures&para;<br>for chargeable purposes would decrease, and therefore the&para;<br>amount of the dues payable by objecting nonmembers the&para;<br>following year would also decrease. This decrease, however, would not fully recompense nonmembers who did not&para;<br>opt out after receiving the regular notice but would have&para;<br>opted out if they had been permitted to do so when the&para;<br>special assessment was announced.5 And in any event,&para;<br>even a full refund would not undo the violation of First&para;<br>Amendment rights.

Accordingly, use of figures based on an audit of the union’s operations during an entire previous year makes no sense.&para;<br>Nor would it be feasible to devise a new breakdown of&para;<br>chargeable and nonchargeable expenses for the special&para;<br>assessment.

But “lobbying&para;<br>. . . the electorate” is nothing but another term for supporting political causes and candidates, and we have never&para;<br>held that the First Amendment permits a union to compel&para;<br>nonmembers to support such political activities. On the&para;<br>contrary, as long ago as Street, we noted the important&para;<br>difference between a union’s authority to engage in collective bargaining and related activities on behalf of nonmember employees in a bargaining unit and the union’s&para;<br>use of nonmembers’ money “to support candidates for&para;<br>public office” or “to support political causes which [they]&para;<br>oppos[e].” 367 U.

According to the SEIU, these&para;<br>expenditures were “germane” to the implementation of its&para;<br>contracts because, if Proposition 76 had passed, it would&para;<br>have “effectively permitted the Governor to abrogate the&para;<br>Union’s collective bargaining agreements under certain&para;<br>circumstances, undermining the Union’s ability to perform&para;<br>its representation duty of negotiating effective collective&para;<br>bargaining agreements.” Brief for Respondent 49–50&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>If we were to accept this broad definition of germaneness, it would effectively eviscerate the limitation on the&para;<br>use of compulsory fees to support unions’ controversial&para;<br>political activities. Public-employee salaries, pensions,&para;<br>and other benefits constitute a substantial percentage of&para;<br>the budgets of many States and their subdivisions. As a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>result, a broad array of ballot questions and campaigns for&para;<br>public office may be said to have an effect on present and&para;<br>future contracts between public-sector workers and their&para;<br>employers. If the concept of “germaneness” were as broad&para;<br>as the SEIU advocates, public-sector employees who do&para;<br>not endorse the unions’ goals would be essentially unprotected against being compelled to subsidize political and&para;<br>ideological activities to which they object.&para;<br>Second, even if the SEIU’s statistics are accurate, it does&para;<br>not follow that it was proper for the union to charge objecting nonmembers 56.35%—or any other particular percentage—of the special assessment. Unless it is possible to&para;<br>determine in advance with some degree of accuracy the&para;<br>percentage of union funds that will be used during an&para;<br>upcoming year for chargeable purposes—and the SEIU&para;<br>argues that this is not possible—there is at least a risk&para;<br>that, at the end of the year, unconsenting nonmembers&para;<br>will have paid either too much or too little. Which side&para;<br>should bear this risk?&para;<br>The answer is obvious: the side whose constitutional&para;<br>rights are not at stake. “Given the existence of acceptable&para;<br>alternatives, [a] union cannot be allowed to commit dissenters’ funds to improper uses even temporarily.” Ellis,&para;<br>466 U. S., at 444. Thus, if unconsenting nonmembers pay&para;<br>too much, their First Amendment rights are infringed. On&para;<br>the other hand, if unconsenting nonmembers pay less than&para;<br>their proportionate share, no constitutional right of the&para;<br>union is violated because the union has no constitutional&para;<br>right to receive any payment from these employees. See&para;<br>Davenport, 551 U. S., at 185. The union has simply lost&para;<br>for a few months the “extraordinary” benefit of being empowered to compel nonmembers to pay for services that&para;<br>they may not want and in any event have not agreed to&para;<br>fund.&para;<br>As we have noted, by allowing unions to collect any fees&para;<br>from nonmembers and by permitting unions to use opt-out&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rather than opt-in schemes when annual dues are billed,&para;<br>our cases have substantially impinged upon the First&para;<br>Amendment rights of nonmembers. In the new situation&para;<br>presented here, we see no justification for any further&para;<br>impingement. The general rule—individuals should not&para;<br>be compelled to subsidize private groups or private speech—&para;<br>should prevail.&para;<br>Public-sector unions have the right under the First&para;<br>Amendment to express their views on political and social&para;<br>issues without government interference. See, e.g., Citizens&para;<br>United v. Federal Election Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>But employees who choose not to join a union have the&para;<br>same rights. The First Amendment creates a forum in&para;<br>which all may seek, without hindrance or aid from the&para;<br>State, to move public opinion and achieve their political&para;<br>goals. “First Amendment values [would be] at serious risk&para;<br>if the government [could] compel a particular citizen, or a&para;<br>discrete group of citizens, to pay special subsidies for&para;<br>speech on the side that [the government] favors.” United&para;<br>Foods, 533 U. S., at 411. Therefore, when a public-sector&para;<br>union imposes a special assessment or dues increase, the&para;<br>union must provide a fresh Hudson notice and may not&para;<br>exact any funds from nonmembers without their affirmative consent.9&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Contrary to JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s suggestion, our holding does not&para;<br>venture beyond the scope of the questions on which we granted review&para;<br>or the scope of the parties’ dispute.

A decade later in Hudson, the Court&para;<br>considered the constitutionality of procedures adopted to&para;<br>implement Abood.

Those nonmembers who objected to the apportionment, believing their fee too high, could lodge an&para;<br>objection with the union, proceed through arbitration, and&para;<br>receive a rebate if they won. The Court found this procedure constitutionally inadequate.

The union then used the resulting&para;<br>proportion (which was about 56% chargeable, 44% nonchargeable) as the basis for apportioning the next year’s&para;<br>dues. Thus in June 2005, the union sent all represented&para;<br>employees a Hudson notice setting forth that (roughly) 56&para;<br>to 44 figure. App. 96–106.

And it then applied the resulting figure to&para;<br>determine the percentage of the total fee that objecting&para;<br>nonmembers would have to pay during the next fee-year,&para;<br>which ran from July 2005 to June 2006. Id., at 102. At&para;<br>the end of 2005, auditors again examined the union’s&para;<br>actual expenditures made during 2005. And the union&para;<br>then used those newly audited figures to determine the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>chargeable percentage for the fee-year 2006–2007. Id., at&para;<br>158. Since political expenditures during calendar year&para;<br>2005 turned out to be lower than in 2004, the new chargeable share amounted to about 69% of the total fee bill.&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>Simplifying further to illustrate, I shall describe the&para;<br>system as (1) using audited accounts for Year One to&para;<br>determine the proportion of the fee that objectors must&para;<br>pay during Year Two, and (2) using audited accounts for&para;<br>Year Two to determine the proportion of the fee that objectors must pay during Year Three. If Year One’s&para;<br>chargeable share (as applied to Year Two) turns out to be&para;<br>too high, Year Two’s audited accounts will reflect that fact,&para;<br>and the payable share for Year Three will be reduced&para;<br>accordingly.&para;<br>This system does not put typical objectors to any disadvantage. If, say, in Year One total expenses were&para;<br>$1 million, collective-bargaining expenses amounted to&para;<br>$600,000, and political expenses amounted to $400,000,&para;<br>then the union cannot charge objecting nonmembers more&para;<br>than 60% of normal dues in Year Two. If in Year Two&para;<br>collective-bargaining expenses turned out to be a lesser&para;<br>share of total expenses, say 30%, then the union cannot&para;<br>charge objecting nonmembers more than 30% of the total&para;<br>fee in Year Three. Normally, what the objecting nonmembers lose on the swings they will gain on the roundabouts.&para;<br>This kind of basic administrative system is imperfect.&para;<br>The nature of a union’s expenditures, including nonchargeable political expenditures, varies from year to year,&para;<br>for political needs differ at different stages of political&para;<br>cycles. Thus, last year’s percentages will often fail to&para;<br>match this year’s expenditures patterns. And the possibility that an objecting nonmember’s funds will temporarily&para;<br>help the union pay for a nonchargeable political expenditure (say, in Year Two) is always present—though in this&para;<br>case that did not happen. See infra, at 6–7.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Nonetheless this kind of system enjoys an offsetting&para;<br>administrative virtue. It bases fees upon audited accounts, thereby avoiding the difficulties and disagreements that would surround an effort to determine the&para;<br>relevant proportions by trying to measure union expenditures as they occur or by trying to make predictions about&para;<br>the nature of future expenditures. It consequently gives&para;<br>workers reliable information. It gives workers advance&para;<br>notice of next year’s payable charge. It gives nonmembers&para;<br>a “reasonably prompt” opportunity to object. Hudson, 475&para;<br>U. S., at 310. And, where the chargeable share of next&para;<br>year’s expenses (Year Two) turns out to be lower than last&para;<br>year’s (Year One), it provides offsetting compensation in&para;<br>the form of a lower payable share for the following year&para;<br>(Year Three).&para;<br>In any event, these features are characteristic of an&para;<br>administrative system that “calculat[es]” shares of a union’s fee “on the basis of its expenses during the preceding&para;<br>year.” Id., at 307, n. 18. Hudson stated specifically that&para;<br>the “[u]nion cannot be faulted for calculating its fee” on&para;<br>that basis. Ibid. And no party here has challenged the&para;<br>constitutional validity of that basic administrative system.&para;<br>See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13.&para;<br>III&para;<br>If the union’s basic administrative system does not&para;<br>violate the Constitution, then how could its special assessment have done so? In my view, it did not violate the&para;<br>Constitution, and I shall explain my basis for thinking&para;<br>so by considering separately (1) those nonmembers who&para;<br>objected initially to the 2005 Hudson notice, and (2) those&para;<br>nonmembers who did not initially object.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The special assessment as administered here has&para;<br>worked no constitutional harm upon those nonunion em-&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ployees who raised a general objection at the beginning of&para;<br>the year. The union has honored their objections by subtracting from their special payments the same 44% that it&para;<br>subtracts from each of their ordinary monthly payments.&para;<br>App. 309. And we know that the special assessment here&para;<br>did not even work temporary constitutional harm. That is&para;<br>because audited figures showed that the union’s total&para;<br>nonchargeable (e.g., political) expenses for that year ended&para;<br>up as a lower percentage of total expenses than the previous year. Hence the objecting nonmembers ended up&para;<br>being charged too little, not too much, even with the special assessment thrown into the mix.&para;<br>Let me put the point more specifically. The union’s&para;<br>June 2005 Hudson notice said that the union would&para;<br>charge objecting nonmembers roughly 56% of the dues&para;<br>paid by union members. See App. 102. That 56% figure&para;<br>represented the chargeable portion of expenditures according to the audited figures from 2004. Thus, if the fee&para;<br>charged to a union member pursuant to the 2005 notice&para;<br>was $400, the fee charged to an objecting nonmember was&para;<br>$224. The union similarly prorated the special assessment charging objecting nonmembers 56% of the assessment it imposed upon members. Thus, if the special&para;<br>assessment amounted to $50 for a member, it amounted to&para;<br>$28 for an objecting nonmember. And total dues in this&para;<br>example would have amounted to $450 for a member and&para;<br>$252 for a nonmember.&para;<br>In the event, the union’s chargeable expenses for 2005—&para;<br>including the funds raised pursuant to the special assessment—amounted to more than 56% of its total expenditures. The auditor’s reports show that the union’s total&para;<br>expenditures in 2005 amounted to $40,045,409. Id.,&para;<br>at 166. Chargeable expenses amounted to $27,552,746,&para;<br>which works out to 69% of the total budget. Ibid. Thus, a&para;<br>substantially larger portion of the union’s 2005 spending&para;<br>was chargeable (69%) than it had been in 2004 (56%).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Objecting nonmembers therefore paid 56% of normal fees,&para;<br>even though the chargeable share that year was 69%.&para;<br>That is to say, they paid less than what the Constitution&para;<br>considers to be their fair share. See Abood, 431 U. S., at&para;<br>236–237.&para;<br>Even were the underlying facts different, I can find no&para;<br>constitutional basis for charging an objecting nonmember&para;<br>less than the 56% that the preceding year’s audit showed&para;<br>was appropriate. In general, any effort to send a new&para;<br>notice and then apply special percentages to a special&para;<br>midyear assessment fee runs into administrative difficulties that, as explained above, are avoided with a retrospective system. See supra, at 6. And, of course, requiring the&para;<br>use of some special proportion based on predicted expenditures would contradict Hudson’s determination that prior&para;<br>year, not present year, expenditures can form the basis for&para;<br>the determination of that proportion. See Hudson, supra,&para;<br>at 307, n. 18.&para;<br>In the particular example before us these general problems are camouflaged by the fact that the union itself said&para;<br>that the assessment was to be used for political purposes.&para;<br>Hence it is tempting to say that 100% of the assessment&para;<br>is not chargeable. But future cases are most unlikely to&para;<br>be so clear; disputes will arise over union predictions (say,&para;<br>that only 20% of the special assessment will be used for&para;<br>political purposes); and the Court will then perhaps understand the wisdom of Hudson’s holding. In any event,&para;<br>we have made clear in other cases that money is fungible.&para;<br>Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 373 U. S. 746, 753 (1963).&para;<br>Whether a particular expenditure was funded by regular&para;<br>dues or the special assessment is “of bookkeeping significance only rather than a matter of real substance.” Ibid.&para;<br>And, the Court’s focus on the announced purposes of the&para;<br>special assessment, rather than yearly expenditures taken&para;<br>as a whole, is beside the point.&para;<br>The Court’s response to these problems, particularly the&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>administrative calculation problems, is apparently to depart yet further from the Court’s earlier holdings. It&para;<br>seems to say that an objector can withhold 100%, not&para;<br>simply of a special assessment made for political purposes,&para;<br>but of any special assessment whatsoever, including an&para;<br>assessment made solely for the purpose of paying for extra&para;<br>chargeable costs, such as extended contract negotiations,&para;<br>pension plan experts, or newly assessed contributions to&para;<br>replenish a national union’s collective-bargaining assistance funds. See ante, at 21–22. Although this rule is&para;<br>comparatively simple to administer, it cannot be reconciled with the Court’s previous constitutional holdings.&para;<br>Abood, along with every related case the Court has ever&para;<br>decided, makes clear that the Constitution allows a union&para;<br>to assess nonmembers a pro rata share of fees insofar&para;<br>as they are used to pay for these kinds of collectivebargaining expenses. See 431 U. S., at 234–236; see also&para;<br>Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 524 (1991);&para;<br>Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740, 760 (1961); Ellis, 466&para;<br>U. S., at 447; Davenport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551&para;<br>U. S. 177, 181 (2007); Locke v. Karass, 555 U. S. 207, 210&para;<br>(2009). How could the majority now hold to the contrary?&para;<br>If there are good reasons for requiring departure from&para;<br>the basic Hudson-approved administrative system, they&para;<br>are not the reasons the Court provides. It suggests that&para;<br>the basic Hudson administrative system gives the union&para;<br>the freedom to misclassify, arguing, for example, that the&para;<br>union has adopted an overly broad definition of chargeability. See ante, at 20–21. The 2005 proportion, however,&para;<br>rested upon audited 2004 accounts. While petitioners&para;<br>argue in this Court that the union misclassified parts&para;<br>of the special assessment (which was not imposed until&para;<br>2005), no brief filed in this case (and certainly no court&para;<br>below) has challenged the accuracy of the 2004 figures or&para;<br>the resulting chargeable/nonchargeable allocation. Indeed, the 2004 accounts were audited before the special&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>assessment at the center of this case was even imposed.&para;<br>Compare App. 108 (reflecting that the audit of the 2004&para;<br>budget was completed by April 25, 2005) with id., at 25&para;<br>(reflecting approval of the special assessment on July 30,&para;<br>2005).&para;<br>More specifically, the Court suggests that the Constitution prohibits the union’s classification of money spent&para;<br>“ ‘lobbying . . . the electorate’ ” as a chargeable expense.&para;<br>See ante, at 20. But California state law explicitly permits&para;<br>the union to classify some lobbying expenses as chargeable. See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §3515.8 (West 2010) (a&para;<br>nonmember’s fair share includes “the costs of support&para;<br>of lobbying activities designed to foster policy goals and&para;<br>collective negotiations and contract administration”); see&para;<br>also Lillebo v. Davis, 222 Cal. App. 3d 1421, 1442, 272 Cal.&para;<br>Rptr. 638, 651 (1990) (construing §3515.8 narrowly, but&para;<br>explaining that “[w]e cannot fathom how a union’s lobbying the Legislature for improvement of the conditions of&para;<br>employment of the members of its bargaining unit . . .&para;<br>could not be considered to be part of its role as representative . . .”). No one has attacked the constitutionality of&para;<br>California’s law; no brief argues the question; and this&para;<br>Court does not normally find state laws unconstitutional&para;<br>without, at least, giving those who favor the law an opportunity to argue the matter.&para;<br>The Court further complains that the basic administrative system requires an objecting nonmember to “come up&para;<br>with the resources to mount” a “legal challenge” to the&para;<br>union’s allocation “in a timely fashion.” Ante, at 19. That&para;<br>concern too is misplaced. The union has offered to pay for&para;<br>neutral arbitration of such disputes before the American&para;<br>Arbitration Association. App. 103–104. And, again, insofar as the Court casts doubt on the constitutional validity&para;<br>of the basic system, the Court does so without the benefit&para;<br>of argument.&para;<br>Finally, the Court argues that (Step 1) Hudson is “pred-&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>icated on the assumption that a union’s allocation of funds&para;<br>for chargeable and nonchargeable purposes is not likely to&para;<br>vary greatly from one year to the next,” ante, at 18; that&para;<br>(Step 2) this assumption does not apply to midyear assessments; hence (Step 3) what appears binding precedent&para;<br>(namely Hudson) does not bind the Court in its interpretation of the Constitution as applied to those assessments.&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>I must jump this logical ship, however, at Step 1. I&para;<br>cannot find in Hudson the “assumption” of uniform expenditures that the Court says underlies it. The assumption does not appear there explicitly. And it is hard to&para;<br>believe any such assumption could implicitly lurk within&para;<br>a case involving a union’s political expenditures. Those&para;<br>expenditures inevitably vary from political season to&para;<br>season. They inevitably depend upon the number and&para;<br>kind of union-related matters currently visible on the&para;<br>political agenda. Cf., e.g., App. 102, 158, 223 (union’s&para;<br>chargeability proportion varies significantly over three&para;<br>years, from 56.35% in 2004, to 68.8% in 2005, to 60.3% in&para;<br>2006). And it is hard to believe that the Members of this&para;<br>Court, when deciding Abood, were not fully aware of these&para;<br>obvious facts.&para;<br>B&para;<br>A stronger case can be made for allowing nonmember&para;<br>employees who did not object at the beginning of the dues&para;<br>year to object (for the first time) to a special assessment.&para;<br>That is because, unlike the nonmember who objected&para;<br>initially, the union will not permit that initially nonobjecting nonmember to withhold anything from the special&para;<br>assessment fee. Nonetheless, there are powerful reasons&para;<br>not to allow the nonmember who did not object initially to&para;<br>the annual fee to object now for the first time to the midyear special assessment.&para;<br>For one thing, insofar as a new objection permits the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>new objector to withhold only the portion of the fee that&para;<br>will pay for nonchargeable expenses (as the logic of the&para;<br>concurring Justices would suggest), the administrative&para;<br>problems that I earlier discussed apply. See supra, at 6.&para;<br>That is to say, unions, arbitrators, and courts will have to&para;<br>determine, on the basis of a prediction, how much of the&para;<br>special assessment the new objector can withhold. I concede that many administrative problems could be overcome were the new objector allowed to withhold only the&para;<br>same 44% of the fee that the union here permitted initial objectors to withhold (a figure based on 2004 audited accounts). But no Member of the Court takes that&para;<br>approach.&para;<br>For another thing, as I have previously pointed out, the&para;<br>Court would permit nonmembers who did not object at the&para;<br>beginning of the year (like those who did then object) to&para;<br>object to (and to pay none of) every special assessment,&para;<br>including those made to raise money to pay additional&para;<br>collective-bargaining expenses. This approach may avoid&para;<br>the uncertainty and resulting disputes inherent in an effort to limit withholding to the nonchargeable portion of&para;<br>the fee. But the price of avoiding those disputes is to&para;<br>reduce the financial contribution the union will receive&para;<br>even when a special assessment pays only for unexpected&para;<br>but perfectly legitimate collective-bargaining expenses.&para;<br>See supra, at 8–10.&para;<br>Moreover, to provide a new opportunity to object requires providing for explanations, potential challenges, the&para;<br>development of separate accounts, and additional administrative procedures. That means providing extra time and&para;<br>extra money. By definition, however, special assessments&para;<br>are special; time may matter; and unlike the annual dues&para;<br>payment, the union is unlikely to be able to provide what&para;<br>is here a 6-month delay (between the close of the 2004&para;<br>audited year and the beginning of the next mid-2005 dues&para;<br>year) that can be used to examine accounts and process&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>objections. In a word, a new opportunity to object means&para;<br>time, effort, and funds set aside to deal with a new layer of&para;<br>administrative procedure.&para;<br>I recognize that allowing objections only once a year is&para;<br>only one possible way to administer a fee-charging system.&para;<br>In principle, one might allow nonmembers to pose new&para;<br>objections to their dues payments biannually, or quarterly,&para;<br>or even once a month, as actual expenses do, or do not,&para;<br>correspond to initial union predictions. But for constitutional purposes the critical fact is that annual objection is&para;<br>at least one reasonably practical way to permit the principled objector to avoid paying for politics with which he&para;<br>disagrees. See Hudson, 475 U. S., at 307, n. 18. And that&para;<br>is so whether ordinary or special assessments are at stake.&para;<br>Further, the nonmember who did not object initially is&para;<br>not likely to be a nonmember who strongly opposes the&para;<br>union’s politics. That many unions take political positions and that they spend money seeking to advance those&para;<br>positions is not exactly a secret. All those whom this&para;<br>union represents know from history that it spends money&para;<br>each year for nonchargeable purposes. And any nonmember who has significant negative views about such matters&para;<br>is likely to have objected in advance. Those who did not&para;<br>object initially (but do so later) likely include many whose&para;<br>objection rests, not upon constitutionally protected political grounds, but simply upon a desire not to pay a higher&para;<br>fee. And those who withhold fees for that reason are not&para;<br>entitled to constitutional protection in doing so. Here, the&para;<br>nonobjector cannot even claim that an increase in the total&para;<br>fee (by the amount of the special assessment) took him by&para;<br>surprise, for in its initial Hudson notice the union said&para;<br>that “[d]ues are subject to change without further notice to&para;<br>fee payers.” App. 98.&para;<br>Finally, if the union will not let a nonmember object to a&para;<br>special assessment, that nonmember has an easy remedy.&para;<br>He or she can simply object the first time around. After&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>all, the possibility of a special assessment is known in&para;<br>advance; the possibility that some, or all of it, will help the&para;<br>union make political expenditures is known in advance;&para;<br>the fact that the union will spend a significant amount of&para;<br>ordinary dues upon political matters is known in advance.&para;<br>To obtain protection all a nonmember who believes he&para;<br>might object to some future political expenditure has to do&para;<br>is to object in advance. His or her fees will decline from&para;<br>the beginning. And, if the nonmember forgets to object,&para;<br>there is always next year—when the chargeable amount of&para;<br>the fee will be based on this year’s actual expenditures.&para;<br>Given these considerations, I do not believe the First&para;<br>Amendment requires giving a second objection opportunity to those nonmembers who did not object the first time.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The Court also holds that, “when a public-sector union&para;<br>imposes a special assessment or dues increase,” it “may&para;<br>not exact any funds from nonmembers without their affirmative consent.” Ante, at 22. In other words, the Court&para;<br>mandates an “opt-in” system in respect to the payment of&para;<br>special assessments.&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s concurring opinion explains why&para;<br>the Court is wrong to impose this requirement. See ante,&para;<br>at 2–6 (opinion concurring in judgment). It runs directly&para;<br>contrary to precedent. No party asked that we do so. The&para;<br>matter has not been fully argued in this Court or in the&para;<br>courts below. I agree with her about this matter.&para;<br>The decision is particularly unfortunate given the fact&para;<br>that each reason the Court offers in support of its “opt-in”&para;<br>conclusion seems in logic to apply, not just to special assessments, but to ordinary yearly fee charges as well. At&para;<br>least, its opinion can be so read. And that fact virtually&para;<br>guarantees that the opinion will play a central role in an&para;<br>ongoing, intense political debate.&para;<br>The debate is generally about whether, the extent to&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>KNOX v. SERVICE EMPLOYEES&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>which, and the circumstances under which a union that&para;<br>represents nonmembers in collective bargaining can require those nonmembers to help pay for the union’s (constitutionally chargeable) collective-bargaining expenses.&para;<br>Twenty-three States have enacted “right to work” laws,&para;<br>which, in effect, prevent unions from requiring nonmembers to pay any of those costs. See Dept. of Labor, Wage&para;<br>and Hour Division, State Right-to-Work Laws (Jan. 2009),&para;<br>online at http://www.dol.gov/whd/state/righttowork.htm (as&para;<br>visited June 18, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court’s&para;<br>case file). Other States have rejected the “right to work”&para;<br>approach and permit unions to require contributions from&para;<br>nonmembers, while protecting those nonmembers’ right&para;<br>to opt out of supporting the union’s political activities.&para;<br>E.g., Cal. Govt. Code Ann. §§3502.5(a), 3515.8. Still others&para;<br>have enacted compromise laws that assume a nonmember&para;<br>does not wish to pay the nonchargeable portion of the fee&para;<br>unless he or she affirmatively indicates a desire to do so.&para;<br>See Wash. Rev. Code §42.17A.500 (2010) (providing that a&para;<br>union cannot use a nonmember’s agency fee for political&para;<br>purposes “unless affirmatively authorized by the individual”). The debate about public unions’ collective-bargaining&para;<br>rights is currently intense.&para;<br>The question of how a nonmember indicates a desire not&para;<br>to pay constitutes an important part of this debate. Must&para;<br>the union assume that the nonmember does not intend to&para;<br>pay unless he affirmatively indicates his desire to pay, by&para;<br>“opting in”? Or, may the union assume that the nonmember is willing to pay unless the nonmember indicates a&para;<br>desire not to pay, by “opting out”? Where, as here, nonchargeable political expenses are at issue, there may be a&para;<br>significant number of represented nonmembers who do not&para;<br>feel strongly enough about the union’s politics to indicate a&para;<br>choice either way. That being so, an “opt-in” requirement&para;<br>can reduce union revenues significantly, a matter of considerable importance to the union, while the additional&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.
