SEBELIUS, SECRETARY OF &para;<br>&para;<br>HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–393.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 26, 27, 28, 2012—Decided June 28, 2012*&para;<br>&para;<br>In 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care&para;<br>Act in order to increase the number of Americans covered by health&para;<br>insurance and decrease the cost of health care. One key provision is&para;<br>the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to maintain&para;<br>“minimum essential” health insurance coverage. 26 U. S. C. §5000A.&para;<br>For individuals who are not exempt, and who do not receive health&para;<br>insurance through an employer or government program, the means of&para;<br>satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private&para;<br>company. Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the&para;<br>mandate must make a “[s]hared responsibility payment” to the Federal Government. §5000A(b)(1). The Act provides that this “penalty”&para;<br>will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service with an individual’s taxes, and “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner” as tax&para;<br>penalties. §§5000A(c), (g)(1).&para;<br>Another key provision of the Act is the Medicaid expansion. The&para;<br>current Medicaid program offers federal funding to States to assist&para;<br>pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the elderly, and&para;<br>the disabled in obtaining medical care. 42 U. S. C. §1396d(a). The&para;<br>Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medicaid program and&para;<br>increases the number of individuals the States must cover. For ex——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 11–398, Department of Health and Human Services et al. v. Florida et al., and No. 11–400, Florida et al. v. Department&para;<br>of Health and Human Services et al., also on certiorari to the same&para;<br>court.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>ample, the Act requires state programs to provide Medicaid coverage&para;<br>by 2014 to adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, whereas many States now cover adults with children only&para;<br>if their income is considerably lower, and do not cover childless adults&para;<br>at all. §1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII). The Act increases federal funding to&para;<br>cover the States’ costs in expanding Medicaid coverage. §1396d(y)(1).&para;<br>But if a State does not comply with the Act’s new coverage requirements, it may lose not only the federal funding for those requirements, but all of its federal Medicaid funds. §1396c.&para;<br>Twenty-six States, several individuals, and the National Federation of Independent Business brought suit in Federal District Court,&para;<br>challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the&para;<br>Medicaid expansion. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit&para;<br>upheld the Medicaid expansion as a valid exercise of Congress’s&para;<br>spending power, but concluded that Congress lacked authority to enact the individual mandate. Finding the mandate severable from the&para;<br>Act’s other provisions, the Eleventh Circuit left the rest of the Act intact.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.&para;<br>648 F. 3d 1235, affirmed in part and reversed in part.&para;<br>1. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court with&para;<br>respect to Part II, concluding that the Anti-Injunction Act does not&para;<br>bar this suit.&para;<br>The Anti-Injunction Act provides that “no suit for the purpose of&para;<br>restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person,” 26 U. S. C. §7421(a), so that those&para;<br>subject to a tax must first pay it and then sue for a refund. The present challenge seeks to restrain the collection of the shared responsibility payment from those who do not comply with the individual&para;<br>mandate. But Congress did not intend the payment to be treated as&para;<br>a “tax” for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. The Affordable Care&para;<br>Act describes the payment as a “penalty,” not a “tax.” That label&para;<br>cannot control whether the payment is a tax for purposes of the Constitution, but it does determine the application of the Anti-Injunction&para;<br>Act. The Anti-Injunction Act therefore does not bar this suit. Pp. 11–&para;<br>15.&para;<br>2. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS concluded in Part III–A that the individual mandate is not a valid exercise of Congress’s power under the&para;<br>Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause. Pp. 16–30.&para;<br>(a) The Constitution grants Congress the power to “regulate&para;<br>Commerce.” Art. I, §8, cl. 3 (emphasis added). The power to regulate&para;<br>commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated. This Court’s precedent reflects this understanding: As expansive as this Court’s cases construing the scope of the commerce&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>power have been, they uniformly describe the power as reaching “activity.” E.g., United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 560. The individual mandate, however, does not regulate existing commercial activity. It instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by&para;<br>purchasing a product, on the ground that their failure to do so affects&para;<br>interstate commerce.&para;<br>Construing the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate&para;<br>individuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a&para;<br>new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority. Congress already possesses expansive power to regulate what people do.&para;<br>Upholding the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause&para;<br>would give Congress the same license to regulate what people do not&para;<br>do. The Framers knew the difference between doing something and&para;<br>doing nothing. They gave Congress the power to regulate commerce,&para;<br>not to compel it. Ignoring that distinction would undermine the principle that the Federal Government is a government of limited and&para;<br>enumerated powers. The individual mandate thus cannot be sustained under Congress’s power to “regulate Commerce.” Pp. 16–27.&para;<br>(b) Nor can the individual mandate be sustained under the Necessary and Proper Clause as an integral part of the Affordable Care&para;<br>Act’s other reforms. Each of this Court’s prior cases upholding laws&para;<br>under that Clause involved exercises of authority derivative of, and&para;<br>in service to, a granted power. E.g., United States v. Comstock, 560&para;<br>U. S. ___. The individual mandate, by contrast, vests Congress with&para;<br>the extraordinary ability to create the necessary predicate to the exercise of an enumerated power and draw within its regulatory scope&para;<br>those who would otherwise be outside of it. Even if the individual&para;<br>mandate is “necessary” to the Affordable Care Act’s other reforms,&para;<br>such an expansion of federal power is not a “proper” means for making those reforms effective. Pp. 27–30.&para;<br>3. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS concluded in Part III–B that the individual mandate must be construed as imposing a tax on those who do&para;<br>not have health insurance, if such a construction is reasonable.&para;<br>The most straightforward reading of the individual mandate is that&para;<br>it commands individuals to purchase insurance. But, for the reasons&para;<br>explained, the Commerce Clause does not give Congress that power.&para;<br>It is therefore necessary to turn to the Government’s alternative argument: that the mandate may be upheld as within Congress’s power&para;<br>to “lay and collect Taxes.” Art. I, §8, cl. 1. In pressing its taxing&para;<br>power argument, the Government asks the Court to view the mandate as imposing a tax on those who do not buy that product. Because “every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to&para;<br>save a statute from unconstitutionality,” Hooper v. California, 155&para;<br>U. S. 648, 657, the question is whether it is “fairly possible” to inter-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>pret the mandate as imposing such a tax, Crowell v. Benson, 285&para;<br>U. S. 22, 62. Pp. 31–32.&para;<br>4. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court with&para;<br>respect to Part III–C, concluding that the individual mandate may be&para;<br>upheld as within Congress’s power under the Taxing Clause. Pp. 33–&para;<br>44.&para;<br>(a) The Affordable Care Act describes the “[s]hared responsibility&para;<br>payment” as a “penalty,” not a “tax.” That label is fatal to the application of the Anti-Injunction Act. It does not, however, control&para;<br>whether an exaction is within Congress’s power to tax. In answering&para;<br>that constitutional question, this Court follows a functional approach,&para;<br>“[d]isregarding the designation of the exaction, and viewing its substance and application.” United States v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287,&para;<br>294. Pp. 33–35.&para;<br>(b) Such an analysis suggests that the shared responsibility&para;<br>payment may for constitutional purposes be considered a tax. The&para;<br>payment is not so high that there is really no choice but to buy health&para;<br>insurance; the payment is not limited to willful violations, as penalties for unlawful acts often are; and the payment is collected solely by&para;<br>the IRS through the normal means of taxation. Cf. Bailey v. Drexel&para;<br>Furniture Co., 259 U. S. 20, 36–37. None of this is to say that payment is not intended to induce the purchase of health insurance. But&para;<br>the mandate need not be read to declare that failing to do so is unlawful. Neither the Affordable Care Act nor any other law attaches&para;<br>negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance, beyond&para;<br>requiring a payment to the IRS. And Congress’s choice of language—&para;<br>stating that individuals “shall” obtain insurance or pay a “penalty”—&para;<br>does not require reading §5000A as punishing unlawful conduct. It&para;<br>may also be read as imposing a tax on those who go without insurance. See New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 169–174.&para;<br>Pp. 35–40.&para;<br>(c) Even if the mandate may reasonably be characterized as a&para;<br>tax, it must still comply with the Direct Tax Clause, which provides:&para;<br>“No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion&para;<br>to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.”&para;<br>Art. I, §9, cl. 4. A tax on going without health insurance is not like a&para;<br>capitation or other direct tax under this Court’s precedents. It therefore need not be apportioned so that each State pays in proportion to&para;<br>its population. Pp. 40–41.&para;<br>5. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, joined by JUSTICE BREYER and JUSTICE&para;<br>KAGAN, concluded in Part IV that the Medicaid expansion violates&para;<br>the Constitution by threatening States with the loss of their existing&para;<br>Medicaid funding if they decline to comply with the expansion.&para;<br>Pp. 45–58.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(a) The Spending Clause grants Congress the power “to pay the&para;<br>Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United States.”&para;<br>Art. I, §8, cl. 1. Congress may use this power to establish cooperative&para;<br>state-federal Spending Clause programs. The legitimacy of Spending&para;<br>Clause legislation, however, depends on whether a State voluntarily&para;<br>and knowingly accepts the terms of such programs. Pennhurst State&para;<br>School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17. “[T]he Constitution simply does not give Congress the authority to require the States&para;<br>to regulate.” New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 178. When&para;<br>Congress threatens to terminate other grants as a means of pressuring the States to accept a Spending Clause program, the legislation&para;<br>runs counter to this Nation’s system of federalism. Cf. South Dakota&para;<br>v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 211. Pp. 45–51.&para;<br>(b) Section 1396c gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to penalize States that choose not to participate in&para;<br>the Medicaid expansion by taking away their existing Medicaid funding. 42 U. S. C. §1396c. The threatened loss of over 10 percent of a&para;<br>State’s overall budget is economic dragooning that leaves the States&para;<br>with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion. The&para;<br>Government claims that the expansion is properly viewed as only a&para;<br>modification of the existing program, and that this modification is&para;<br>permissible because Congress reserved the “right to alter, amend, or&para;<br>repeal any provision” of Medicaid. §1304. But the expansion accomplishes a shift in kind, not merely degree. The original program was&para;<br>designed to cover medical services for particular categories of vulnerable individuals. Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid is transformed into a program to meet the health care needs of the entire&para;<br>nonelderly population with income below 133 percent of the poverty&para;<br>level. A State could hardly anticipate that Congress’s reservation of&para;<br>the right to “alter” or “amend” the Medicaid program included the&para;<br>power to transform it so dramatically. The Medicaid expansion thus&para;<br>violates the Constitution by threatening States with the loss of their&para;<br>existing Medicaid funding if they decline to comply with the expansion. Pp. 51–55.&para;<br>(c) The constitutional violation is fully remedied by precluding&para;<br>the Secretary from applying §1396c to withdraw existing Medicaid&para;<br>funds for failure to comply with the requirements set out in the expansion. See §1303. The other provisions of the Affordable Care Act&para;<br>are not affected. Congress would have wanted the rest of the Act to&para;<br>stand, had it known that States would have a genuine choice whether&para;<br>to participate in the Medicaid expansion. Pp. 55–58.&para;<br>6. JUSTICE GINSBURG, joined by JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, is of the view&para;<br>that the Spending Clause does not preclude the Secretary from withholding Medicaid funds based on a State’s refusal to comply with the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>expanded Medicaid program. But given the majority view, she&para;<br>agrees with THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s conclusion in Part IV–B that the&para;<br>Medicaid Act’s severability clause, 42 U. S. C. §1303, determines the&para;<br>appropriate remedy. Because THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds the withholding—not the granting—of federal funds incompatible with the Spending Clause, Congress’ extension of Medicaid remains available to any&para;<br>State that affirms its willingness to participate. Even absent §1303’s&para;<br>command, the Court would have no warrant to invalidate the funding&para;<br>offered by the Medicaid expansion, and surely no basis to tear down&para;<br>the ACA in its entirety. When a court confronts an unconstitutional&para;<br>statute, its endeavor must be to conserve, not destroy, the legislation.&para;<br>See, e.g., Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546&para;<br>U. S. 320, 328–330. Pp. 60–61.&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

SEBELIUS&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>2010: the individual mandate, which requires individuals&para;<br>to purchase a health insurance policy providing a minimum level of coverage; and the Medicaid expansion, which&para;<br>gives funds to the States on the condition that they provide specified health care to all citizens whose income falls&para;<br>below a certain threshold. We do not consider whether the&para;<br>Act embodies sound policies. That judgment is entrusted&para;<br>to the Nation’s elected leaders. We ask only whether&para;<br>Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact&para;<br>the challenged provisions.&para;<br>In our federal system, the National Government possesses only limited powers; the States and the people&para;<br>retain the remainder. Nearly two centuries ago, Chief&para;<br>Justice Marshall observed that “the question respecting&para;<br>the extent of the powers actually granted” to the Federal&para;<br>Government “is perpetually arising, and will probably&para;<br>continue to arise, as long as our system shall exist.”&para;<br>McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819). In this&para;<br>case we must again determine whether the Constitution&para;<br>grants Congress powers it now asserts, but which many&para;<br>States and individuals believe it does not possess. Resolving this controversy requires us to examine both the limits&para;<br>of the Government’s power, and our own limited role in&para;<br>policing those boundaries.&para;<br>The Federal Government “is acknowledged by all to&para;<br>be one of enumerated powers.” Ibid. That is, rather&para;<br>than granting general authority to perform all the conceivable functions of government, the Constitution lists, or&para;<br>enumerates, the Federal Government’s powers. Congress&para;<br>may, for example, “coin Money,” “establish Post Offices,”&para;<br>and “raise and support Armies.” Art. I, §8, cls. 5, 7, 12.&para;<br>The enumeration of powers is also a limitation of powers, because “[t]he enumeration presupposes something not&para;<br>enumerated.” Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 195 (1824).&para;<br>The Constitution’s express conferral of some powers&para;<br>makes clear that it does not grant others. And the Federal&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Government “can exercise only the powers granted to it.”&para;<br>McCulloch, supra, at 405.&para;<br>Today, the restrictions on government power foremost in&para;<br>many Americans’ minds are likely to be affirmative prohibitions, such as contained in the Bill of Rights. These&para;<br>affirmative prohibitions come into play, however, only where&para;<br>the Government possesses authority to act in the first&para;<br>place. If no enumerated power authorizes Congress to&para;<br>pass a certain law, that law may not be enacted, even if it&para;<br>would not violate any of the express prohibitions in the&para;<br>Bill of Rights or elsewhere in the Constitution.&para;<br>Indeed, the Constitution did not initially include a Bill&para;<br>of Rights at least partly because the Framers felt the enumeration of powers sufficed to restrain the Government.&para;<br>As Alexander Hamilton put it, “the Constitution is itself,&para;<br>in every rational sense, and to every useful purpose,&para;<br>A BILL OF RIGHTS.” The Federalist No. 84, p. 515 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). And when the Bill of Rights was ratified,&para;<br>it made express what the enumeration of powers necessarily implied: “The powers not delegated to the United&para;<br>States by the Constitution . . . are reserved to the States&para;<br>respectively, or to the people.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 10.&para;<br>The Federal Government has expanded dramatically over&para;<br>the past two centuries, but it still must show that a constitutional grant of power authorizes each of its actions. See,&para;<br>e.g., United States v. Comstock, 560 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>The same does not apply to the States, because the Constitution is not the source of their power. The Constitution may restrict state governments—as it does, for&para;<br>example, by forbidding them to deny any person the equal&para;<br>protection of the laws. But where such prohibitions do&para;<br>not apply, state governments do not need constitutional authorization to act. The States thus can and do perform&para;<br>many of the vital functions of modern government—&para;<br>punishing street crime, running public schools, and zoning&para;<br>property for development, to name but a few—even though&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>the Constitution’s text does not authorize any government&para;<br>to do so. Our cases refer to this general power of governing, possessed by the States but not by the Federal Government, as the “police power.” See, e.g., United States v.&para;<br>Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618–619 (2000).&para;<br>“State sovereignty is not just an end in itself: Rather,&para;<br>federalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive from&para;<br>the diffusion of sovereign power.” New York v. United&para;<br>States, 505 U. S. 144, 181 (1992) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). Because the police power is controlled by&para;<br>50 different States instead of one national sovereign, the&para;<br>facets of governing that touch on citizens’ daily lives are&para;<br>normally administered by smaller governments closer to&para;<br>the governed. The Framers thus ensured that powers&para;<br>which “in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives,&para;<br>liberties, and properties of the people” were held by governments more local and more accountable than a distant federal bureaucracy. The Federalist No. 45, at 293&para;<br>(J. Madison). The independent power of the States also&para;<br>serves as a check on the power of the Federal Government:&para;<br>“By denying any one government complete jurisdiction&para;<br>over all the concerns of public life, federalism protects the&para;<br>liberty of the individual from arbitrary power.” Bond v.&para;<br>United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9–10).&para;<br>This case concerns two powers that the Constitution&para;<br>does grant the Federal Government, but which must be&para;<br>read carefully to avoid creating a general federal authority&para;<br>akin to the police power. The Constitution authorizes&para;<br>Congress to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and&para;<br>among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.”&para;<br>Art. I, §8, cl. 3. Our precedents read that to mean that&para;<br>Congress may regulate “the channels of interstate commerce,” “persons or things in interstate commerce,” and&para;<br>“those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.” Morrison, supra, at 609 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). The power over activities that substantially&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>affect interstate commerce can be expansive. That power&para;<br>has been held to authorize federal regulation of such seemingly local matters as a farmer’s decision to grow wheat&para;<br>for himself and his livestock, and a loan shark’s extortionate collections from a neighborhood butcher shop.&para;<br>See Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942); Perez v.&para;<br>United States, 402 U. S. 146 (1971).&para;<br>Congress may also “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the&para;<br>common Defence and general Welfare of the United&para;<br>States.” U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1. Put simply, Congress may tax and spend. This grant gives the Federal&para;<br>Government considerable influence even in areas where&para;<br>it cannot directly regulate. The Federal Government may&para;<br>enact a tax on an activity that it cannot authorize, forbid,&para;<br>or otherwise control. See, e.g., License Tax Cases, 5 Wall.&para;<br>462, 471 (1867). And in exercising its spending power,&para;<br>Congress may offer funds to the States, and may condition&para;<br>those offers on compliance with specified conditions. See,&para;<br>e.g., College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 686 (1999). These&para;<br>offers may well induce the States to adopt policies that&para;<br>the Federal Government itself could not impose. See, e.g.,&para;<br>South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 205–206 (1987) (conditioning federal highway funds on States raising their&para;<br>drinking age to 21).&para;<br>The reach of the Federal Government’s enumerated&para;<br>powers is broader still because the Constitution authorizes&para;<br>Congress to “make all Laws which shall be necessary and&para;<br>proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.”&para;<br>Art. I, §8, cl. 18.

The Act aims to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care. The Act’s 10&para;<br>titles stretch over 900 pages and contain hundreds of&para;<br>provisions. This case concerns constitutional challenges to&para;<br>two key provisions, commonly referred to as the individual&para;<br>mandate and the Medicaid expansion.&para;<br>The individual mandate requires most Americans to&para;<br>maintain “minimum essential” health insurance coverage.&para;<br>26 U. S. C. §5000A. The mandate does not apply to some&para;<br>individuals, such as prisoners and undocumented aliens.&para;<br>§5000A(d). Many individuals will receive the required coverage through their employer, or from a government program such as Medicaid or Medicare. See §5000A(f). But&para;<br>for individuals who are not exempt and do not receive&para;<br>health insurance through a third party, the means of&para;<br>satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a&para;<br>private company.&para;<br>Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the&para;<br>mandate must make a “[s]hared responsibility payment”&para;<br>to the Federal Government. §5000A(b)(1). That payment,&para;<br>which the Act describes as a “penalty,” is calculated as a&para;<br>percentage of household income, subject to a floor based on&para;<br>a specified dollar amount and a ceiling based on the average annual premium the individual would have to pay for&para;<br>qualifying private health insurance. §5000A(c). In 2016,&para;<br>for example, the penalty will be 2.5 percent of an individual’s household income, but no less than $695 and no more&para;<br>than the average yearly premium for insurance that covers 60 percent of the cost of 10 specified services (e.g.,&para;<br>prescription drugs and hospitalization). Ibid.; 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§18022. The Act provides that the penalty will be paid to&para;<br>the Internal Revenue Service with an individual’s taxes,&para;<br>and “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner”&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

And some individuals who are subject to the mandate are nonetheless exempt from the&para;<br>penalty—for example, those with income below a certain&para;<br>threshold and members of Indian tribes. §5000A(e).&para;<br>On the day the President signed the Act into law, Florida and 12 other States filed a complaint in the Federal&para;<br>District Court for the Northern District of Florida.

The plaintiffs alleged,&para;<br>among other things, that the individual mandate provisions of the Act exceeded Congress’s powers under Article&para;<br>I of the Constitution. The District Court agreed, holding&para;<br>that Congress lacked constitutional power to enact the&para;<br>individual mandate. 780 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (ND Fla. 2011).&para;<br>The District Court determined that the individual mandate could not be severed from the remainder of the Act,&para;<br>and therefore struck down the Act in its entirety.

The court affirmed the District Court’s holding that the individual mandate exceeds&para;<br>Congress’s power. 648 F. 3d 1235 (2011). The panel&para;<br>unanimously agreed that the individual mandate did not&para;<br>impose a tax, and thus could not be authorized by Congress’s power to “lay and collect Taxes.” U. S.

Judge Marcus dissented, reasoning that the individual mandate regulates economic activity that has a clear&para;<br>effect on interstate commerce.&para;<br>Having held the individual mandate to be unconstitutional, the majority examined whether that provision&para;<br>could be severed from the remainder of the Act. The majority determined that, contrary to the District Court’s&para;<br>view, it could. The court thus struck down only the individual mandate, leaving the Act’s other provisions intact.&para;<br>648 F. 3d, at 1328.&para;<br>Other Courts of Appeals have also heard challenges to&para;<br>the individual mandate. The Sixth Circuit and the D. C.&para;<br>Circuit upheld the mandate as a valid exercise of Congress’s commerce power.

The Fourth Circuit determined&para;<br>that the Anti-Injunction Act prevents courts from considering the merits of that question. See Liberty Univ., Inc.&para;<br>v. Geithner, 671 F. 3d 391 (2011). That statute bars suits&para;<br>“for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection&para;<br>of any tax.” 26 U. S. C. §7421(a). A majority of the Fourth&para;<br>Circuit panel reasoned that the individual mandate’s&para;<br>penalty is a tax within the meaning of the Anti-Injunction&para;<br>Act, because it is a financial assessment collected by the&para;<br>IRS through the normal means of taxation. The majority&para;<br>therefore determined that the plaintiffs could not challenge the individual mandate until after they paid the&para;<br>penalty.1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The Eleventh Circuit did not consider whether the Anti-Injunction&para;<br>Act bars challenges to the individual mandate. The District Court had&para;<br>determined that it did not, and neither side challenged that holding on&para;<br>appeal. The same was true in the Fourth Circuit, but that court&para;<br>examined the question sua sponte because it viewed the Anti-Injunction&para;<br>Act as a limit on its subject matter jurisdiction.

Enacted in&para;<br>1965, Medicaid offers federal funding to States to assist&para;<br>pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the&para;<br>elderly, and the disabled in obtaining medical care. See 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §1396a(a)(10). In order to receive that funding,&para;<br>States must comply with federal criteria governing matters such as who receives care and what services are provided at what cost. By 1982 every State had chosen to&para;<br>participate in Medicaid. Federal funds received through&para;<br>the Medicaid program have become a substantial part of&para;<br>state budgets, now constituting over 10 percent of most&para;<br>States’ total revenue.&para;<br>The Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medicaid program and increases the number of individuals the&para;<br>States must cover. For example, the Act requires state&para;<br>programs to provide Medicaid coverage to adults with&para;<br>incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level,&para;<br>whereas many States now cover adults with children only&para;<br>if their income is considerably lower, and do not cover&para;<br>childless adults at all. See §1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII). The&para;<br>Act increases federal funding to cover the States’ costs in&para;<br>expanding Medicaid coverage, although States will bear a&para;<br>portion of the costs on their own. §1396d(y)(1). If a State&para;<br>does not comply with the Act’s new coverage requirements, it may lose not only the federal funding for those&para;<br>requirements, but all of its federal Medicaid funds.

The Anti-Injunction Act provides&para;<br>that “no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment&para;<br>or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court&para;<br>by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed.” 26 U.

The present challenge to the mandate thus seeks to&para;<br>restrain the penalty’s future collection. Amicus contends&para;<br>that the Internal Revenue Code treats the penalty as a&para;<br>tax, and that the Anti-Injunction Act therefore bars this&para;<br>suit.&para;<br>The text of the pertinent statutes suggests otherwise.&para;<br>The Anti-Injunction Act applies to suits “for the purpose&para;<br>of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.”&para;<br>§7421(a) (emphasis added). Congress, however, chose to&para;<br>describe the “[s]hared responsibility payment” imposed on&para;<br>those who forgo health insurance not as a “tax,” but as a&para;<br>“penalty.” §§5000A(b), (g)(2). There is no immediate&para;<br>reason to think that a statute applying to “any tax” would&para;<br>apply to a “penalty.”&para;<br>Congress’s decision to label this exaction a “penalty”&para;<br>rather than a “tax” is significant because the Affordable&para;<br>Care Act describes many other exactions it creates as&para;<br>“taxes.” See Thomas More, 651 F. 3d, at 551. Where&para;<br>Congress uses certain language in one part of a statute&para;<br>and different language in another, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally. See Russello v.&para;<br>United States, 464 U.

It is true that Congress cannot change whether&para;<br>an exaction is a tax or a penalty for constitutional purposes simply by describing it as one or the other. Congress&para;<br>may not, for example, expand its power under the Taxing&para;<br>Clause, or escape the Double Jeopardy Clause’s constraint&para;<br>on criminal sanctions, by labeling a severe financial pun-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

S. 767, 779 (1994).&para;<br>The Anti-Injunction Act and the Affordable Care Act,&para;<br>however, are creatures of Congress’s own creation. How&para;<br>they relate to each other is up to Congress, and the best&para;<br>evidence of Congress’s intent is the statutory text. We&para;<br>have thus applied the Anti-Injunction Act to statutorily&para;<br>described “taxes” even where that label was inaccurate.&para;<br>See Bailey v. George, 259 U. S. 16 (1922) (Anti-Injunction&para;<br>Act applies to “Child Labor Tax” struck down as exceeding&para;<br>Congress’s taxing power in Drexel Furniture).&para;<br>Congress can, of course, describe something as a penalty&para;<br>but direct that it nonetheless be treated as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. For example, 26 U. S. C.&para;<br>§6671(a) provides that “any reference in this title to ‘tax’&para;<br>imposed by this title shall be deemed also to refer to the&para;<br>penalties and liabilities provided by” subchapter 68B of&para;<br>the Internal Revenue Code. Penalties in subchapter 68B&para;<br>are thus treated as taxes under Title 26, which includes&para;<br>the Anti-Injunction Act. The individual mandate, however, is not in subchapter 68B of the Code. Nor does any&para;<br>other provision state that references to taxes in Title 26&para;<br>shall also be “deemed” to apply to the individual mandate.&para;<br>Amicus attempts to show that Congress did render the&para;<br>Anti-Injunction Act applicable to the individual mandate,&para;<br>albeit by a more circuitous route. Section 5000A(g)(1) specifies that the penalty for not complying with the mandate “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner&para;<br>as an assessable penalty under subchapter B of chapter&para;<br>68.” Assessable penalties in subchapter 68B, in turn,&para;<br>“shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as&para;<br>taxes.” §6671(a). According to amicus, by directing that&para;<br>the penalty be “assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes,” §5000A(g)(1) made the Anti-Injunction Act&para;<br>applicable to this penalty.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

It argues that §5000A(g)(1)&para;<br>does not direct courts to apply the Anti-Injunction Act,&para;<br>because §5000A(g) is a directive only to the Secretary of&para;<br>the Treasury to use the same “ ‘methodology and procedures’ ” to collect the penalty that he uses to collect taxes.&para;<br>Brief for United States 32–33 (quoting Seven-Sky, 661&para;<br>F. 3d, at 11).&para;<br>We think the Government has the better reading. As&para;<br>it observes, “Assessment” and “Collection” are chapters of&para;<br>the Internal Revenue Code providing the Secretary authority to assess and collect taxes, and generally specifying&para;<br>the means by which he shall do so. See §6201 (assessment authority); §6301 (collection authority). Section&para;<br>5000A(g)(1)’s command that the penalty be “assessed and&para;<br>collected in the same manner” as taxes is best read as&para;<br>referring to those chapters and giving the Secretary the&para;<br>same authority and guidance with respect to the penalty.&para;<br>That interpretation is consistent with the remainder of&para;<br>§5000A(g), which instructs the Secretary on the tools he&para;<br>may use to collect the penalty. See §5000A(g)(2)(A) (barring criminal prosecutions); §5000A(g)(2)(B) (prohibiting&para;<br>the Secretary from using notices of lien and levies). The&para;<br>Anti-Injunction Act, by contrast, says nothing about the&para;<br>procedures to be used in assessing and collecting taxes.&para;<br>Amicus argues in the alternative that a different section&para;<br>of the Internal Revenue Code requires courts to treat the&para;<br>penalty as a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act. Section&para;<br>6201(a) authorizes the Secretary to make “assessments of&para;<br>all taxes (including interest, additional amounts, additions&para;<br>to the tax, and assessable penalties).” (Emphasis added.)&para;<br>Amicus contends that the penalty must be a tax, because&para;<br>it is an assessable penalty and §6201(a) says that taxes&para;<br>include assessable penalties.&para;<br>That argument has force only if §6201(a) is read in&para;<br>isolation. The Code contains many provisions treating&para;<br>taxes and assessable penalties as distinct terms. See, e.g.,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>§§860(h)(1), 6324A(a), 6601(e)(1)–(2), 6602, 7122(b). There&para;<br>would, for example, be no need for §6671(a) to deem “tax”&para;<br>to refer to certain assessable penalties if the Code already included all such penalties in the term “tax.” Indeed, amicus’s earlier observation that the Code requires&para;<br>assessable penalties to be assessed and collected “in the&para;<br>same manner as taxes” makes little sense if assessable&para;<br>penalties are themselves taxes. In light of the Code’s&para;<br>consistent distinction between the terms “tax” and “assessable penalty,” we must accept the Government’s interpretation: §6201(a) instructs the Secretary that his&para;<br>authority to assess taxes includes the authority to assess&para;<br>penalties, but it does not equate assessable penalties to&para;<br>taxes for other purposes.&para;<br>The Affordable Care Act does not require that the penalty for failing to comply with the individual mandate be&para;<br>treated as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.&para;<br>The Anti-Injunction Act therefore does not apply to this&para;<br>suit, and we may proceed to the merits.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Government advances two theories for the proposition that Congress had constitutional authority to enact&para;<br>the individual mandate. First, the Government argues&para;<br>that Congress had the power to enact the mandate under&para;<br>the Commerce Clause. Under that theory, Congress may&para;<br>order individuals to buy health insurance because the&para;<br>failure to do so affects interstate commerce, and could undercut the Affordable Care Act’s other reforms. Second,&para;<br>the Government argues that if the commerce power does&para;<br>not support the mandate, we should nonetheless uphold it&para;<br>as an exercise of Congress’s power to tax. According to the&para;<br>Government, even if Congress lacks the power to direct&para;<br>individuals to buy insurance, the only effect of the individual mandate is to raise taxes on those who do not do so,&para;<br>and thus the law may be upheld as a tax.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Government’s first argument is that the individual&para;<br>mandate is a valid exercise of Congress’s power under the&para;<br>Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause.&para;<br>According to the Government, the health care market is&para;<br>characterized by a significant cost-shifting problem. Everyone will eventually need health care at a time and to an&para;<br>extent they cannot predict, but if they do not have insurance, they often will not be able to pay for it. Because&para;<br>state and federal laws nonetheless require hospitals to&para;<br>provide a certain degree of care to individuals without&para;<br>regard to their ability to pay, see, e.g., 42 U. S. C. §1395dd;&para;<br>Fla. Stat. Ann. §395.1041, hospitals end up receiving&para;<br>compensation for only a portion of the services they provide. To recoup the losses, hospitals pass on the cost to&para;<br>insurers through higher rates, and insurers, in turn, pass&para;<br>on the cost to policy holders in the form of higher premiums. Congress estimated that the cost of uncompensated care raises family health insurance premiums, on&para;<br>average, by over $1,000 per year. 42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(F).&para;<br>In the Affordable Care Act, Congress addressed the&para;<br>problem of those who cannot obtain insurance coverage&para;<br>because of preexisting conditions or other health issues. It&para;<br>did so through the Act’s “guaranteed-issue” and “communityrating” provisions. These provisions together prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage to those with&para;<br>such conditions or charging unhealthy individuals higher&para;<br>premiums than healthy individuals. See §§300gg, 300gg–1,&para;<br>300gg–3, 300gg–4.&para;<br>The guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms do&para;<br>not, however, address the issue of healthy individuals who&para;<br>choose not to purchase insurance to cover potential health&para;<br>care needs. In fact, the reforms sharply exacerbate that&para;<br>problem, by providing an incentive for individuals to delay&para;<br>purchasing health insurance until they become sick, relying on the promise of guaranteed and affordable coverage.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>The reforms also threaten to impose massive new costs on&para;<br>insurers, who are required to accept unhealthy individuals&para;<br>but prohibited from charging them rates necessary to pay&para;<br>for their coverage. This will lead insurers to significantly&para;<br>increase premiums on everyone. See Brief for America’s&para;<br>Health Insurance Plans et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11–&para;<br>393 etc. 8–9.&para;<br>The individual mandate was Congress’s solution to&para;<br>these problems. By requiring that individuals purchase&para;<br>health insurance, the mandate prevents cost-shifting by&para;<br>those who would otherwise go without it. In addition, the&para;<br>mandate forces into the insurance risk pool more healthy&para;<br>individuals, whose premiums on average will be higher&para;<br>than their health care expenses. This allows insurers to&para;<br>subsidize the costs of covering the unhealthy individuals&para;<br>the reforms require them to accept. The Government&para;<br>claims that Congress has power under the Commerce and&para;<br>Necessary and Proper Clauses to enact this solution.&para;<br>1&para;<br>The Government contends that the individual mandate&para;<br>is within Congress’s power because the failure to purchase insurance “has a substantial and deleterious effect&para;<br>on interstate commerce” by creating the cost-shifting problem. Brief for United States 34. The path of our Commerce Clause decisions has not always run smooth, see&para;<br>United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 552–559 (1995), but&para;<br>it is now well established that Congress has broad authority under the Clause. We have recognized, for example,&para;<br>that “[t]he power of Congress over interstate commerce is&para;<br>not confined to the regulation of commerce among the&para;<br>states,” but extends to activities that “have a substantial&para;<br>effect on interstate commerce.” United States v. Darby,&para;<br>312 U. S. 100, 118–119 (1941). Congress’s power, moreover, is not limited to regulation of an activity that by itself&para;<br>substantially affects interstate commerce, but also extends&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

S., at 127–128.&para;<br>Given its expansive scope, it is no surprise that Congress has employed the commerce power in a wide variety&para;<br>of ways to address the pressing needs of the time. But&para;<br>Congress has never attempted to rely on that power to&para;<br>compel individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase&para;<br>an unwanted product.3 Legislative novelty is not necessarily fatal; there is a first time for everything. But&para;<br>sometimes “the most telling indication of [a] severe constitutional problem . . . is the lack of historical precedent”&para;<br>for Congress’s action. Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)&para;<br>(slip op., at 25) (internal quotation marks omitted). At the&para;<br>very least, we should “pause to consider the implications of&para;<br>the Government’s arguments” when confronted with such&para;<br>new conceptions of federal power. Lopez, supra, at 564.&para;<br>The Constitution grants Congress the power to “regulate&para;<br>Commerce.” Art. I, §8, cl. 3 (emphasis added). The power&para;<br>to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated. If the power to “regulate”&para;<br>something included the power to create it, many of the&para;<br>provisions in the Constitution would be superfluous.

Each&para;<br>of those mandates—to report for jury duty, to register for the draft, to&para;<br>purchase firearms in anticipation of militia service, to exchange gold&para;<br>currency for paper currency, and to file a tax return—are based on&para;<br>constitutional provisions other than the Commerce Clause.

If the power to regulate the&para;<br>armed forces or the value of money included the power to&para;<br>bring the subject of the regulation into existence, the&para;<br>specific grant of such powers would have been unnecessary. The language of the Constitution reflects the natural understanding that the power to regulate assumes&para;<br>there is already something to be regulated.

As&para;<br>expansive as our cases construing the scope of the commerce power have been, they all have one thing in common: They uniformly describe the power as reaching&para;<br>“activity.” It is nearly impossible to avoid the word when&para;<br>quoting them. See, e.g., Lopez, supra, at 560 (“Where&para;<br>economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating that activity will be sus——————&para;<br>4 JUSTICE&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG suggests that “at the time the Constitution was&para;<br>framed, to ‘regulate’ meant, among other things, to require action.”&para;<br>Post, at 23 (citing Seven-Sky v.

But to reach&para;<br>this conclusion, the case cited by JUSTICE GINSBURG relied on a dictionary in which “[t]o order; to command” was the fifth-alternative definition of “to direct,” which was itself the second-alternative definition of&para;<br>“to regulate.” See Seven-Sky, supra, at 16 (citing S. Johnson, Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed. 1773) (reprinted 1978)). It is&para;<br>unlikely that the Framers had such an obscure meaning in mind when&para;<br>they used the word “regulate.” Far more commonly, “[t]o regulate”&para;<br>meant “[t]o adjust by rule or method,” which presupposes something to&para;<br>adjust. 2 Johnson, supra, at 1619; see also Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at 196&para;<br>(defining the commerce power as the power “to prescribe the rule by&para;<br>which commerce is to be governed”).&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

Allowing Congress to justify federal regulation by&para;<br>pointing to the effect of inaction on commerce would bring&para;<br>countless decisions an individual could potentially make&para;<br>within the scope of federal regulation, and—under the&para;<br>Government’s theory—empower Congress to make those&para;<br>decisions for him.&para;<br>Applying the Government’s logic to the familiar case of&para;<br>Wickard v. Filburn shows how far that logic would carry&para;<br>us from the notion of a government of limited powers. In&para;<br>Wickard, the Court famously upheld a federal penalty imposed on a farmer for growing wheat for consumption&para;<br>on his own farm. 317 U. S., at 114–115, 128–129. That&para;<br>amount of wheat caused the farmer to exceed his quota&para;<br>under a program designed to support the price of wheat by&para;<br>limiting supply. The Court rejected the farmer’s argument&para;<br>that growing wheat for home consumption was beyond the&para;<br>reach of the commerce power. It did so on the ground that&para;<br>the farmer’s decision to grow wheat for his own use allowed him to avoid purchasing wheat in the market. That&para;<br>decision, when considered in the aggregate along with similar decisions of others, would have had a substantial effect on the interstate market for wheat. Id., at 127–129.&para;<br>Wickard has long been regarded as “perhaps the most&para;<br>far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over&para;<br>intrastate activity,” Lopez, 514 U. S., at 560, but the Government’s theory in this case would go much further.&para;<br>Under Wickard it is within Congress’s power to regulate&para;<br>the market for wheat by supporting its price. But price&para;<br>can be supported by increasing demand as well as by&para;<br>decreasing supply. The aggregated decisions of some&para;<br>consumers not to purchase wheat have a substantial effect&para;<br>on the price of wheat, just as decisions not to purchase&para;<br>health insurance have on the price of insurance. Congress&para;<br>can therefore command that those not buying wheat do so,&para;<br>just as it argues here that it may command that those not&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>buying health insurance do so. The farmer in Wickard&para;<br>was at least actively engaged in the production of wheat,&para;<br>and the Government could regulate that activity because&para;<br>of its effect on commerce. The Government’s theory here&para;<br>would effectively override that limitation, by establishing&para;<br>that individuals may be regulated under the Commerce&para;<br>Clause whenever enough of them are not doing something&para;<br>the Government would have them do.&para;<br>Indeed, the Government’s logic would justify a mandatory purchase to solve almost any problem. See Seven-Sky,&para;<br>661 F. 3d, at 14–15 (noting the Government’s inability&para;<br>to “identify any mandate to purchase a product or service in interstate commerce that would be unconstitutional” under its theory of the commerce power). To&para;<br>consider a different example in the health care market, many&para;<br>Americans do not eat a balanced diet. That group makes&para;<br>up a larger percentage of the total population than those&para;<br>without health insurance. See, e.g., Dept. of Agriculture&para;<br>and Dept. of Health and Human Services, Dietary Guidelines for Americans 1 (2010). The failure of that group&para;<br>to have a healthy diet increases health care costs, to a&para;<br>greater extent than the failure of the uninsured to purchase insurance. See, e.g., Finkelstein, Trogdon, Cohen, &amp;&para;<br>Dietz, Annual Medical Spending Attributable to Obesity:&para;<br>Payer- and Service-Specific Estimates, 28 Health Affairs&para;<br>w822 (2009) (detailing the “undeniable link between rising rates of obesity and rising medical spending,” and estimating that “the annual medical burden of obesity has&para;<br>risen to almost 10 percent of all medical spending and&para;<br>could amount to $147 billion per year in 2008”). Those increased costs are borne in part by other Americans who&para;<br>must pay more, just as the uninsured shift costs to the&para;<br>insured. See Center for Applied Ethics, Voluntary Health&para;<br>Risks: Who Should Pay?, 6 Issues in Ethics 6 (1993) (noting “overwhelming evidence that individuals with unhealthy habits pay only a fraction of the costs associated&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

Congress addressed the insurance problem by&para;<br>ordering everyone to buy insurance. Under the Government’s theory, Congress could address the diet problem&para;<br>by ordering everyone to buy vegetables. See Dietary&para;<br>Guidelines, supra, at 19 (“Improved nutrition, appropriate&para;<br>eating behaviors, and increased physical activity have tremendous potential to . . . reduce health care costs”).&para;<br>People, for reasons of their own, often fail to do things&para;<br>that would be good for them or good for society. Those&para;<br>failures—joined with the similar failures of others—can&para;<br>readily have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.&para;<br>Under the Government’s logic, that authorizes Congress to&para;<br>use its commerce power to compel citizens to act as the&para;<br>Government would have them act.&para;<br>That is not the country the Framers of our Constitution&para;<br>envisioned. James Madison explained that the Commerce&para;<br>Clause was “an addition which few oppose and from which&para;<br>no apprehensions are entertained.” The Federalist No. 45,&para;<br>at 293. While Congress’s authority under the Commerce&para;<br>Clause has of course expanded with the growth of the&para;<br>national economy, our cases have “always recognized that&para;<br>the power to regulate commerce, though broad indeed, has&para;<br>limits.” Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 196 (1968). The&para;<br>Government’s theory would erode those limits, permitting&para;<br>Congress to reach beyond the natural extent of its authority, “everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and&para;<br>drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.” The Federalist No. 48, at 309 (J. Madison). Congress already enjoys&para;<br>vast power to regulate much of what we do. Accepting&para;<br>the Government’s theory would give Congress the same&para;<br>license to regulate what we do not do, fundamentally&para;<br>changing the relation between the citizen and the Federal&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Government.6&para;<br>To an economist, perhaps, there is no difference between&para;<br>activity and inactivity; both have measurable economic&para;<br>effects on commerce. But the distinction between doing&para;<br>something and doing nothing would not have been lost on&para;<br>the Framers, who were “practical statesmen,” not metaphysical philosophers. Industrial Union Dept., AFL–CIO&para;<br>v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U. S. 607, 673 (1980)&para;<br>(Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). As we have explained, “the framers of the Constitution were not mere&para;<br>visionaries, toying with speculations or theories, but&para;<br>practical men, dealing with the facts of political life as&para;<br>they understood them, putting into form the government&para;<br>they were creating, and prescribing in language clear&para;<br>and intelligible the powers that government was to take.”&para;<br>South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437, 449 (1905).&para;<br>The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it, and for over 200 years both our&para;<br>decisions and Congress’s actions have reflected this understanding. There is no reason to depart from that understanding now.&para;<br>The Government sees things differently. It argues that&para;<br>because sickness and injury are unpredictable but unavoidable, “the uninsured as a class are active in the market for health care, which they regularly seek and obtain.”&para;<br>Brief for United States 50. The individual mandate&para;<br>“merely regulates how individuals finance and pay for that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 In an attempt to recast the individual mandate as a regulation of&para;<br>commercial activity, JUSTICE GINSBURG suggests that “[a]n individual&para;<br>who opts not to purchase insurance from a private insurer can be seen&para;<br>as actively selecting another form of insurance: self-insurance.” Post, at&para;<br>26. But “self-insurance” is, in this context, nothing more than a description of the failure to purchase insurance. Individuals are no more&para;<br>“activ[e] in the self-insurance market” when they fail to purchase&para;<br>insurance, ibid., than they are active in the “rest” market when doing&para;<br>nothing.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>active participation—requiring that they do so through&para;<br>insurance, rather than through attempted self-insurance&para;<br>with the back-stop of shifting costs to others.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Government repeats the phrase “active in the market for health care” throughout its brief, see id., at 7, 18,&para;<br>34, 50, but that concept has no constitutional significance.&para;<br>An individual who bought a car two years ago and may&para;<br>buy another in the future is not “active in the car market”&para;<br>in any pertinent sense. The phrase “active in the market”&para;<br>cannot obscure the fact that most of those regulated by&para;<br>the individual mandate are not currently engaged in any&para;<br>commercial activity involving health care, and that fact is&para;<br>fatal to the Government’s effort to “regulate the uninsured&para;<br>as a class.” Id., at 42. Our precedents recognize Congress’s power to regulate “class[es] of activities,” Gonzales&para;<br>v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 17 (2005) (emphasis added), not&para;<br>classes of individuals, apart from any activity in which&para;<br>they are engaged, see, e.g., Perez, 402 U. S., at 153 (“Petitioner is clearly a member of the class which engages in&para;<br>‘extortionate credit transactions’ . . .” (emphasis deleted)).&para;<br>The individual mandate’s regulation of the uninsured as&para;<br>a class is, in fact, particularly divorced from any link to&para;<br>existing commercial activity. The mandate primarily&para;<br>affects healthy, often young adults who are less likely to&para;<br>need significant health care and have other priorities for&para;<br>spending their money. It is precisely because these individuals, as an actuarial class, incur relatively low health&para;<br>care costs that the mandate helps counter the effect of&para;<br>forcing insurance companies to cover others who impose&para;<br>greater costs than their premiums are allowed to reflect.&para;<br>See 42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(I) (recognizing that the mandate&para;<br>would “broaden the health insurance risk pool to include&para;<br>healthy individuals, which will lower health insurance&para;<br>premiums”). If the individual mandate is targeted at a&para;<br>class, it is a class whose commercial inactivity rather than&para;<br>activity is its defining feature.&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>The Government, however, claims that this does not&para;<br>matter. The Government regards it as sufficient to trigger&para;<br>Congress’s authority that almost all those who are uninsured will, at some unknown point in the future, engage&para;<br>in a health care transaction. Asserting that “[t]here is no&para;<br>temporal limitation in the Commerce Clause,” the Government argues that because “[e]veryone subject to this&para;<br>regulation is in or will be in the health care market,” they&para;<br>can be “regulated in advance.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 109 (Mar.&para;<br>27, 2012).&para;<br>The proposition that Congress may dictate the conduct&para;<br>of an individual today because of prophesied future activity finds no support in our precedent. We have said that&para;<br>Congress can anticipate the effects on commerce of an economic activity. See, e.g., Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB,&para;<br>305 U. S. 197 (1938) (regulating the labor practices of&para;<br>utility companies); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United&para;<br>States, 379 U.

S. 294&para;<br>(1964) (prohibiting discrimination by restaurant owners).&para;<br>But we have never permitted Congress to anticipate that&para;<br>activity itself in order to regulate individuals not currently&para;<br>engaged in commerce. Each one of our cases, including&para;<br>those cited by JUSTICE GINSBURG, post, at 20–21, involved&para;<br>preexisting economic activity. See, e.g., Wickard, 317&para;<br>U. S., at 127–129 (producing wheat); Raich, supra, at 25&para;<br>(growing marijuana).&para;<br>Everyone will likely participate in the markets for food,&para;<br>clothing, transportation, shelter, or energy; that does not&para;<br>authorize Congress to direct them to purchase particular&para;<br>products in those or other markets today. The Commerce&para;<br>Clause is not a general license to regulate an individual&para;<br>from cradle to grave, simply because he will predictably&para;<br>engage in particular transactions.

J.&para;<br>&para;<br>The Government argues that the individual mandate&para;<br>can be sustained as a sort of exception to this rule, because&para;<br>health insurance is a unique product. According to the&para;<br>Government, upholding the individual mandate would&para;<br>not justify mandatory purchases of items such as cars or&para;<br>broccoli because, as the Government puts it, “[h]ealth insurance is not purchased for its own sake like a car or&para;<br>broccoli; it is a means of financing health-care consumption and covering universal risks.” Reply Brief for United&para;<br>States 19. But cars and broccoli are no more purchased&para;<br>for their “own sake” than health insurance. They are&para;<br>purchased to cover the need for transportation and food.&para;<br>The Government says that health insurance and health&para;<br>care financing are “inherently integrated.” Brief for United&para;<br>States 41. But that does not mean the compelled purchase&para;<br>of the first is properly regarded as a regulation of the&para;<br>second. No matter how “inherently integrated” health&para;<br>insurance and health care consumption may be, they are&para;<br>not the same thing: They involve different transactions,&para;<br>entered into at different times, with different providers.&para;<br>And for most of those targeted by the mandate, significant&para;<br>health care needs will be years, or even decades, away.&para;<br>The proximity and degree of connection between the&para;<br>mandate and the subsequent commercial activity is too lacking to justify an exception of the sort urged by the Government.&para;<br>The individual mandate forces individuals&para;<br>into commerce precisely because they elected to refrain&para;<br>from commercial activity. Such a law cannot be sustained under a clause authorizing Congress to “regulate&para;<br>Commerce.”&para;<br>2&para;<br>The Government next contends that Congress has the&para;<br>power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact the&para;<br>individual mandate because the mandate is an “integral&para;<br>part of a comprehensive scheme of economic regulation”—&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

Under this argument, it is not necessary to consider the effect that an&para;<br>individual’s inactivity may have on interstate commerce; it&para;<br>is enough that Congress regulate commercial activity in a&para;<br>way that requires regulation of inactivity to be effective.&para;<br>The power to “make all Laws which shall be necessary&para;<br>and proper for carrying into Execution” the powers enumerated in the Constitution, Art. I, §8, cl. 18, vests Congress with authority to enact provisions “incidental to the&para;<br>[enumerated] power, and conducive to its beneficial exercise,” McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 418. Although the Clause&para;<br>gives Congress authority to “legislate on that vast mass&para;<br>of incidental powers which must be involved in the constitution,” it does not license the exercise of any “great&para;<br>substantive and independent power[s]” beyond those specifically enumerated. Id., at 411, 421. Instead, the Clause is&para;<br>“ ‘merely a declaration, for the removal of all uncertainty,&para;<br>that the means of carrying into execution those [powers]&para;<br>otherwise granted are included in the grant.’ ” Kinsella v.&para;<br>United States ex rel.

Instead, Congress could reach beyond&para;<br>&para;<br>30&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C.

Even if the individual mandate is “necessary” to the&para;<br>Act’s insurance reforms, such an expansion of federal&para;<br>power is not a “proper” means for making those reforms&para;<br>effective.&para;<br>The Government relies primarily on our decision in&para;<br>Gonzales v. Raich. In Raich, we considered “comprehensive legislation to regulate the interstate market” in marijuana. 545 U. S., at 22. Certain individuals sought an&para;<br>exemption from that regulation on the ground that they&para;<br>engaged in only intrastate possession and consumption.&para;<br>We denied any exemption, on the ground that marijuana&para;<br>is a fungible commodity, so that any marijuana could&para;<br>be readily diverted into the interstate market. Congress’s&para;<br>attempt to regulate the interstate market for marijuana&para;<br>would therefore have been substantially undercut if it&para;<br>could not also regulate intrastate possession and consumption. Id., at 19. Accordingly, we recognized that&para;<br>“Congress was acting well within its authority” under the&para;<br>Necessary and Proper Clause even though its “regulation&para;<br>ensnare[d] some purely intrastate activity.” Id., at 22; see&para;<br>also Perez, 402 U.

Raich thus did not involve&para;<br>the exercise of any “great substantive and independent&para;<br>power,” McCulloch, supra, at 411, of the sort at issue here.&para;<br>Instead, it concerned only the constitutionality of “individual applications of a concededly valid statutory&para;<br>scheme.” Raich, supra, at 23 (emphasis added).&para;<br>Just as the individual mandate cannot be sustained as&para;<br>a law regulating the substantial effects of the failure to&para;<br>purchase health insurance, neither can it be upheld as&para;<br>a “necessary and proper” component of the insurance reforms. The commerce power thus does not authorize the&para;<br>mandate.

Because the Commerce Clause does not support the individual mandate, it&para;<br>is necessary to turn to the Government’s second argument:&para;<br>that the mandate may be upheld as within Congress’s&para;<br>enumerated power to “lay and collect Taxes.” Art. I, §8,&para;<br>cl. 1.&para;<br>The Government’s tax power argument asks us to view&para;<br>the statute differently than we did in considering its commerce power theory. In making its Commerce Clause&para;<br>argument, the Government defended the mandate as a&para;<br>regulation requiring individuals to purchase health insurance. The Government does not claim that the taxing&para;<br>power allows Congress to issue such a command. Instead,&para;<br>the Government asks us to read the mandate not as ordering individuals to buy insurance, but rather as imposing a&para;<br>tax on those who do not buy that product.&para;<br>The text of a statute can sometimes have more than one&para;<br>possible meaning. To take a familiar example, a law that&para;<br>reads “no vehicles in the park” might, or might not, ban&para;<br>bicycles in the park. And it is well established that if&para;<br>a statute has two possible meanings, one of which violates&para;<br>the Constitution, courts should adopt the meaning that&para;<br>does not do so. Justice Story said that 180 years ago: “No&para;<br>court ought, unless the terms of an act rendered it unavoidable, to give a construction to it which should involve&para;<br>a violation, however unintentional, of the constitution.”&para;<br>Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 448–449 (1830). Justice&para;<br>Holmes made the same point a century later: “[T]he rule is&para;<br>settled that as between two possible interpretations of a&para;<br>statute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and&para;<br>by the other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which&para;<br>will save the Act.” Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.

SEBELIUS&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>After all, it states that individuals “shall” maintain health&para;<br>insurance. 26 U. S. C. §5000A(a). Congress thought it&para;<br>could enact such a command under the Commerce Clause,&para;<br>and the Government primarily defended the law on that&para;<br>basis. But, for the reasons explained above, the Commerce Clause does not give Congress that power. Under&para;<br>our precedent, it is therefore necessary to ask whether the&para;<br>Government’s alternative reading of the statute—that it&para;<br>only imposes a tax on those without insurance—is a reasonable one.&para;<br>Under the mandate, if an individual does not maintain&para;<br>health insurance, the only consequence is that he must&para;<br>make an additional payment to the IRS when he pays his&para;<br>taxes. See §5000A(b). That, according to the Government,&para;<br>means the mandate can be regarded as establishing a&para;<br>condition—not owning health insurance—that triggers a&para;<br>tax—the required payment to the IRS. Under that theory,&para;<br>the mandate is not a legal command to buy insurance.&para;<br>Rather, it makes going without insurance just another&para;<br>thing the Government taxes, like buying gasoline or earning income. And if the mandate is in effect just a tax hike&para;<br>on certain taxpayers who do not have health insurance, it&para;<br>may be within Congress’s constitutional power to tax.&para;<br>The question is not whether that is the most natural&para;<br>interpretation of the mandate, but only whether it is a&para;<br>“fairly possible” one. Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62&para;<br>(1932). As we have explained, “every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from&para;<br>unconstitutionality.” Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648,&para;<br>657 (1895). The Government asks us to interpret the&para;<br>mandate as imposing a tax, if it would otherwise violate&para;<br>the Constitution. Granting the Act the full measure of&para;<br>deference owed to federal statutes, it can be so read, for&para;<br>the reasons set forth below.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

It does not apply to individuals who do not&para;<br>pay federal income taxes because their household income&para;<br>is less than the filing threshold in the Internal Revenue&para;<br>Code. §5000A(e)(2). For taxpayers who do owe the payment, its amount is determined by such familiar factors as&para;<br>taxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing&para;<br>status. §§5000A(b)(3), (c)(2), (c)(4). The requirement to&para;<br>pay is found in the Internal Revenue Code and enforced by&para;<br>the IRS, which—as we previously explained—must assess&para;<br>and collect it “in the same manner as taxes.” Supra, at&para;<br>13–14. This process yields the essential feature of any tax:&para;<br>it produces at least some revenue for the Government.&para;<br>United States v. Kahriger, 345 U.

It is up to Congress whether to apply the Anti-Injunction Act to any&para;<br>particular statute, so it makes sense to be guided by Congress’s choice of label on that question. That choice does&para;<br>not, however, control whether an exaction is within Congress’s constitutional power to tax.&para;<br>Our precedent reflects this: In 1922, we decided two&para;<br>&para;<br>34&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

Congress knew that suits to obstruct&para;<br>taxes had to await payment under the Anti-Injunction&para;<br>Act; Congress called the child labor tax a tax; Congress&para;<br>therefore intended the Anti-Injunction Act to apply. In&para;<br>the second case, however, we held that the same exaction,&para;<br>although labeled a tax, was not in fact authorized by Congress’s taxing power. Drexel Furniture, 259 U. S., at 38.&para;<br>That constitutional question was not controlled by Congress’s choice of label.&para;<br>We have similarly held that exactions not labeled taxes&para;<br>nonetheless were authorized by Congress’s power to tax.&para;<br>In the License Tax Cases, for example, we held that federal&para;<br>licenses to sell liquor and lottery tickets—for which the&para;<br>licensee had to pay a fee—could be sustained as exercises&para;<br>of the taxing power. 5 Wall., at 471. And in New York v.&para;<br>United States we upheld as a tax a “surcharge” on out-ofstate nuclear waste shipments, a portion of which was&para;<br>paid to the Federal Treasury. 505 U. S., at 171. We thus&para;<br>ask whether the shared responsibility payment falls&para;<br>within Congress’s taxing power, “[d]isregarding the designation of the exaction, and viewing its substance and application.” United States v.

For example, in Drexel Furniture, we focused on three practical&para;<br>characteristics of the so-called tax on employing child&para;<br>laborers that convinced us the “tax” was actually a penalty. First, the tax imposed an exceedingly heavy burden—10 percent of a company’s net income—on those who&para;<br>employed children, no matter how small their infraction.&para;<br>Second, it imposed that exaction only on those who knowingly employed underage laborers. Such scienter requirements are typical of punitive statutes, because Congress&para;<br>often wishes to punish only those who intentionally break&para;<br>the law.

New York urged us to read&para;<br>the statute as a federal command that the state legislature enact legislation to dispose of its waste, which would&para;<br>have violated the Constitution.

No one would doubt that&para;<br>this law imposed a tax, and was within Congress’s power&para;<br>to tax.

See&para;<br>Springer v. United States, 102 U. S. 586, 596–598 (1881).&para;<br>Soon after the framing, Congress passed a tax on ownership of carriages, over James Madison’s objection that it&para;<br>was an unapportioned direct tax. Id., at 597. This Court&para;<br>upheld the tax, in part reasoning that apportioning such&para;<br>a tax would make little sense, because it would have required taxing carriage owners at dramatically different&para;<br>rates depending on how many carriages were in their&para;<br>home State. See Hylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171, 174&para;<br>(1796) (opinion of Chase, J.). The Court was unanimous,&para;<br>and those Justices who wrote opinions either directly&para;<br>asserted or strongly suggested that only two forms of&para;<br>taxation were direct: capitations and land taxes. See id.,&para;<br>at 175; id., at 177 (opinion of Paterson, J.); id., at 183&para;<br>(opinion of Iredell, J.).&para;<br>That narrow view of what a direct tax might be persisted for a century. In 1880, for example, we explained that&para;<br>“direct taxes, within the meaning of the Constitution, are&para;<br>only capitation taxes, as expressed in that instrument,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>41&para;<br>&para;<br>, C. J.&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>of of&para;<br>ROBERTS&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and taxes on real estate.” Springer, supra, at 602. In&para;<br>1895, we expanded our interpretation to include taxes on&para;<br>personal property and income from personal property, in&para;<br>the course of striking down aspects of the federal income&para;<br>tax. Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan &amp; Trust Co., 158 U. S. 601,&para;<br>618 (1895). That result was overturned by the Sixteenth&para;<br>Amendment, although we continued to consider taxes on&para;<br>personal property to be direct taxes. See Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 218–219 (1920).&para;<br>A tax on going without health insurance does not fall&para;<br>within any recognized category of direct tax. It is not a&para;<br>capitation. Capitations are taxes paid by every person,&para;<br>“without regard to property, profession, or any other circumstance.” Hylton, supra, at 175 (opinion of Chase, J.)&para;<br>(emphasis altered). The whole point of the shared responsibility payment is that it is triggered by specific circumstances—earning a certain amount of income but not&para;<br>obtaining health insurance. The payment is also plainly&para;<br>not a tax on the ownership of land or personal property.&para;<br>The shared responsibility payment is thus not a direct tax&para;<br>that must be apportioned among the several States.&para;<br>There may, however, be a more fundamental objection&para;<br>to a tax on those who lack health insurance. Even if only&para;<br>a tax, the payment under §5000A(b) remains a burden&para;<br>that the Federal Government imposes for an omission, not&para;<br>an act. If it is troubling to interpret the Commerce Clause&para;<br>as authorizing Congress to regulate those who abstain&para;<br>from commerce, perhaps it should be similarly troubling to&para;<br>permit Congress to impose a tax for not doing something.&para;<br>Three considerations allay this concern. First, and most&para;<br>importantly, it is abundantly clear the Constitution does&para;<br>not guarantee that individuals may avoid taxation through&para;<br>inactivity. A capitation, after all, is a tax that everyone must pay simply for existing, and capitations are&para;<br>expressly contemplated by the Constitution. The Court&para;<br>today holds that our Constitution protects us from federal&para;<br>&para;<br>42&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>&para;<br>, C. J.&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>of of&para;<br>ROBERTS&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>regulation under the Commerce Clause so long as we abstain from the regulated activity. But from its creation,&para;<br>the Constitution has made no such promise with respect to&para;<br>taxes. See Letter from Benjamin Franklin to M. Le Roy&para;<br>(Nov. 13, 1789) (“Our new Constitution is now established&para;<br>. . . but in this world nothing can be said to be certain,&para;<br>except death and taxes”).&para;<br>Whether the mandate can be upheld under the Commerce Clause is a question about the scope of federal&para;<br>authority. Its answer depends on whether Congress can&para;<br>exercise what all acknowledge to be the novel course of&para;<br>directing individuals to purchase insurance. Congress’s&para;<br>use of the Taxing Clause to encourage buying something&para;<br>is, by contrast, not new. Tax incentives already promote,&para;<br>for example, purchasing homes and professional educations. See 26 U. S. C. §§163(h), 25A. Sustaining the&para;<br>mandate as a tax depends only on whether Congress has&para;<br>properly exercised its taxing power to encourage purchasing health insurance, not whether it can. Upholding the&para;<br>individual mandate under the Taxing Clause thus does&para;<br>not recognize any new federal power. It determines that&para;<br>Congress has used an existing one.&para;<br>Second, Congress’s ability to use its taxing power to&para;<br>influence conduct is not without limits. A few of our cases&para;<br>policed these limits aggressively, invalidating punitive&para;<br>exactions obviously designed to regulate behavior otherwise regarded at the time as beyond federal authority.&para;<br>See, e.g., United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1 (1936); Drexel&para;<br>Furniture, 259 U. S. 20. More often and more recently&para;<br>we have declined to closely examine the regulatory motive&para;<br>or effect of revenue-raising measures. See Kahriger, 345&para;<br>U. S., at 27–31 (collecting cases). We have nonetheless&para;<br>maintained that “ ‘there comes a time in the extension of&para;<br>the penalizing features of the so-called tax when it loses&para;<br>its character as such and becomes a mere penalty with the&para;<br>characteristics of regulation and punishment.’ ” Kurth&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>43&para;<br>&para;<br>, C. J.&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>of of&para;<br>ROBERTS&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Ranch, 511 U. S., at 779 (quoting Drexel Furniture, supra,&para;<br>at 38).&para;<br>We have already explained that the shared responsibility payment’s practical characteristics pass muster as a&para;<br>tax under our narrowest interpretations of the taxing&para;<br>power. Supra, at 35–36. Because the tax at hand is&para;<br>within even those strict limits, we need not here decide the&para;<br>precise point at which an exaction becomes so punitive&para;<br>that the taxing power does not authorize it. It remains&para;<br>true, however, that the “ ‘power to tax is not the power to&para;<br>destroy while this Court sits.’ ” Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v.&para;<br>Texas Co., 336 U. S. 342, 364 (1949) (quoting Panhandle&para;<br>Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 277 U. S. 218, 223&para;<br>(1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting)).&para;<br>Third, although the breadth of Congress’s power to tax&para;<br>is greater than its power to regulate commerce, the taxing&para;<br>power does not give Congress the same degree of control&para;<br>over individual behavior. Once we recognize that Congress may regulate a particular decision under the Commerce Clause, the Federal Government can bring its full&para;<br>weight to bear. Congress may simply command individuals to do as it directs. An individual who disobeys may&para;<br>be subjected to criminal sanctions. Those sanctions can&para;<br>include not only fines and imprisonment, but all the attendant consequences of being branded a criminal: deprivation of otherwise protected civil rights, such as the right&para;<br>to bear arms or vote in elections; loss of employment opportunities; social stigma; and severe disabilities in other&para;<br>controversies, such as custody or immigration disputes.&para;<br>By contrast, Congress’s authority under the taxing&para;<br>power is limited to requiring an individual to pay money&para;<br>into the Federal Treasury, no more. If a tax is properly&para;<br>paid, the Government has no power to compel or punish&para;<br>individuals subject to it. We do not make light of the severe burden that taxation—especially taxation motivated&para;<br>by a regulatory purpose—can impose. But imposition&para;<br>&para;<br>44&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>of a tax nonetheless leaves an individual with a lawful&para;<br>choice to do or not do a certain act, so long as he is willing&para;<br>to pay a tax levied on that choice.11&para;<br>The Affordable Care Act’s requirement that certain individuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health&para;<br>insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax. Because the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role&para;<br>to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.&para;<br>D&para;<br>JUSTICE GINSBURG questions the necessity of rejecting&para;<br>the Government’s commerce power argument, given that&para;<br>§5000A can be upheld under the taxing power. Post, at 37.&para;<br>But the statute reads more naturally as a command to buy&para;<br>insurance than as a tax, and I would uphold it as a command if the Constitution allowed it. It is only because the&para;<br>Commerce Clause does not authorize such a command&para;<br>that it is necessary to reach the taxing power question.&para;<br>And it is only because we have a duty to construe a statute to save it, if fairly possible, that §5000A can be interpreted as a tax. Without deciding the Commerce Clause&para;<br>question, I would find no basis to adopt such a saving&para;<br>construction.&para;<br>The Federal Government does not have the power to&para;<br>order people to buy health insurance. Section 5000A&para;<br>would therefore be unconstitutional if read as a command.&para;<br>The Federal Government does have the power to impose a&para;<br>tax on those without health insurance. Section 5000A is&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 Of course, individuals do not have a lawful choice not to pay a tax&para;<br>due, and may sometimes face prosecution for failing to do so (although&para;<br>not for declining to make the shared responsibility payment, see 26&para;<br>U. S. C. §5000A(g)(2)). But that does not show that the tax restricts the&para;<br>lawful choice whether to undertake or forgo the activity on which the tax&para;<br>is predicated. Those subject to the individual mandate may lawfully&para;<br>forgo health insurance and pay higher taxes, or buy health insurance&para;<br>and pay lower taxes.

This, they argue, violates the basic principle&para;<br>that the “Federal Government may not compel the States&para;<br>to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.” New&para;<br>York, 505 U. S., at 188.&para;<br>There is no doubt that the Act dramatically increases&para;<br>state obligations under Medicaid. The current Medicaid&para;<br>program requires States to cover only certain discrete&para;<br>categories of needy individuals—pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the elderly, and the disabled. 42 U. S. C. §1396a(a)(10). There is no mandatory&para;<br>coverage for most childless adults, and the States typically&para;<br>do not offer any such coverage. The States also enjoy&para;<br>considerable flexibility with respect to the coverage levels&para;<br>for parents of needy families. §1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii). On&para;<br>average States cover only those unemployed parents who&para;<br>make less than 37 percent of the federal poverty level, and&para;<br>only those employed parents who make less than 63 percent of the poverty line. Kaiser Comm’n on Medicaid and&para;<br>the Uninsured, Performing Under Pressure 11, and fig. 11&para;<br>(2012).&para;<br>The Medicaid provisions of the Affordable Care Act, in&para;<br>contrast, require States to expand their Medicaid programs by 2014 to cover all individuals under the age of 65&para;<br>with incomes below 133 percent of the federal poverty line.&para;<br>§1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII). The Act also establishes a new&para;<br>&para;<br>46&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>“[e]ssential health benefits” package, which States must&para;<br>provide to all new Medicaid recipients—a level sufficient&para;<br>to satisfy a recipient’s obligations under the individual mandate. §§1396a(k)(1), 1396u–7(b)(5), 18022(b). The Affordable Care Act provides that the Federal Government&para;<br>will pay 100 percent of the costs of covering these newly&para;<br>eligible individuals through 2016. §1396d(y)(1). In the&para;<br>following years, the federal payment level gradually decreases, to a minimum of 90 percent. Ibid. In light of&para;<br>the expansion in coverage mandated by the Act, the Federal&para;<br>Government estimates that its Medicaid spending will increase by approximately $100 billion per year, nearly 40&para;<br>percent above current levels. Statement of Douglas W.&para;<br>Elmendorf, CBO’s Analysis of the Major Health Care&para;<br>Legislation Enacted in March 2010, p. 14, Table 2 (Mar.&para;<br>30, 2011).&para;<br>The Spending Clause grants Congress the power “to pay&para;<br>the Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of the&para;<br>United States.” U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1. We have&para;<br>long recognized that Congress may use this power to grant&para;<br>federal funds to the States, and may condition such a&para;<br>grant upon the States’ “taking certain actions that Congress could not require them to take.” College Savings Bank,&para;<br>527 U. S., at 686. Such measures “encourage a State&para;<br>to regulate in a particular way, [and] influenc[e] a State’s&para;<br>policy choices.” New York, supra, at 166. The conditions imposed by Congress ensure that the funds are&para;<br>used by the States to “provide for the . . . general Welfare”&para;<br>in the manner Congress intended.&para;<br>At the same time, our cases have recognized limits on&para;<br>Congress’s power under the Spending Clause to secure&para;<br>state compliance with federal objectives. “We have repeatedly characterized . . . Spending Clause legislation as&para;<br>‘much in the nature of a contract.’ ” Barnes v. Gorman,&para;<br>536 U. S. 181, 186 (2002) (quoting Pennhurst State School&para;<br>and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981)). The&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>47&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>legitimacy of Congress’s exercise of the spending power&para;<br>“thus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly&para;<br>accepts the terms of the ‘contract.’ ” Pennhurst, supra,&para;<br>at 17. Respecting this limitation is critical to ensuring&para;<br>that Spending Clause legislation does not undermine the&para;<br>status of the States as independent sovereigns in our federal system. That system “rests on what might at first&para;<br>seem a counterintuitive insight, that ‘freedom is enhanced&para;<br>by the creation of two governments, not one.’ ” Bond, 564&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (quoting Alden v. Maine, 527&para;<br>U. S. 706, 758 (1999)). For this reason, “the Constitution&para;<br>has never been understood to confer upon Congress the&para;<br>ability to require the States to govern according to Congress’ instructions.” New York, supra, at 162. Otherwise&para;<br>the two-government system established by the Framers&para;<br>would give way to a system that vests power in one central&para;<br>government, and individual liberty would suffer.&para;<br>That insight has led this Court to strike down federal legislation that commandeers a State’s legislative or&para;<br>administrative apparatus for federal purposes. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Printz, 521 U. S., at 933 (striking down federal legislation compelling state law enforcement officers to perform&para;<br>federally mandated background checks on handgun purchasers); New York, supra, at 174–175 (invalidating provisions of an Act that would compel a State to either take&para;<br>title to nuclear waste or enact particular state waste&para;<br>regulations). It has also led us to scrutinize Spending&para;<br>Clause legislation to ensure that Congress is not using&para;<br>financial inducements to exert a “power akin to undue&para;<br>influence.” Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S. 548,&para;<br>590 (1937). Congress may use its spending power to create incentives for States to act in accordance with federal&para;<br>policies. But when “pressure turns into compulsion,” ibid.,&para;<br>the legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism.&para;<br>“[T]he Constitution simply does not give Congress the&para;<br>authority to require the States to regulate.” New York,&para;<br>&para;<br>48&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>505 U. S., at 178. That is true whether Congress directly&para;<br>commands a State to regulate or indirectly coerces a State&para;<br>to adopt a federal regulatory system as its own.&para;<br>Permitting the Federal Government to force the States&para;<br>to implement a federal program would threaten the political accountability key to our federal system. “[W]here the&para;<br>Federal Government directs the States to regulate, it may&para;<br>be state officials who will bear the brunt of public disapproval, while the federal officials who devised the regulatory program may remain insulated from the electoral&para;<br>ramifications of their decision.” Id., at 169. Spending&para;<br>Clause programs do not pose this danger when a State has&para;<br>a legitimate choice whether to accept the federal conditions in exchange for federal funds. In such a situation,&para;<br>state officials can fairly be held politically accountable for&para;<br>choosing to accept or refuse the federal offer. But when&para;<br>the State has no choice, the Federal Government can&para;<br>achieve its objectives without accountability, just as in&para;<br>New York and Printz. Indeed, this danger is heightened&para;<br>when Congress acts under the Spending Clause, because&para;<br>Congress can use that power to implement federal policy it&para;<br>could not impose directly under its enumerated powers.&para;<br>We addressed such concerns in Steward Machine. That&para;<br>case involved a federal tax on employers that was abated&para;<br>if the businesses paid into a state unemployment plan that&para;<br>met certain federally specified conditions. An employer&para;<br>sued, alleging that the tax was impermissibly “driv[ing]&para;<br>the state legislatures under the whip of economic pressure&para;<br>into the enactment of unemployment compensation laws&para;<br>at the bidding of the central government.” 301 U. S., at&para;<br>587. We acknowledged the danger that the Federal Government might employ its taxing power to exert a “power&para;<br>akin to undue influence” upon the States. Id., at 590. But&para;<br>we observed that Congress adopted the challenged tax and&para;<br>abatement program to channel money to the States that&para;<br>would otherwise have gone into the Federal Treasury for&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>49&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>use in providing national unemployment services. Congress was willing to direct businesses to instead pay the&para;<br>money into state programs only on the condition that the&para;<br>money be used for the same purposes. Predicating tax&para;<br>abatement on a State’s adoption of a particular type of unemployment legislation was therefore a means to “safeguard [the Federal Government’s] own treasury.” Id., at&para;<br>591. We held that “[i]n such circumstances, if in no others, inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the&para;<br>bounds of power.” Ibid.&para;<br>In rejecting the argument that the federal law was a&para;<br>“weapon[ ] of coercion, destroying or impairing the autonomy of the states,” the Court noted that there was no&para;<br>reason to suppose that the State in that case acted other&para;<br>than through “her unfettered will.” Id., at 586, 590.&para;<br>Indeed, the State itself did “not offer a suggestion that in&para;<br>passing the unemployment law she was affected by duress.” Id., at 589.&para;<br>As our decision in Steward Machine confirms, Congress&para;<br>may attach appropriate conditions to federal taxing and&para;<br>spending programs to preserve its control over the use of&para;<br>federal funds. In the typical case we look to the States to&para;<br>defend their prerogatives by adopting “the simple expedient of not yielding” to federal blandishments when they&para;<br>do not want to embrace the federal policies as their own.&para;<br>Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 482 (1923). The&para;<br>States are separate and independent sovereigns. Sometimes they have to act like it.&para;<br>The States, however, argue that the Medicaid expansion&para;<br>is far from the typical case. They object that Congress has&para;<br>“crossed the line distinguishing encouragement from&para;<br>coercion,” New York, supra, at 175, in the way it has structured the funding: Instead of simply refusing to grant the&para;<br>new funds to States that will not accept the new conditions, Congress has also threatened to withhold those&para;<br>States’ existing Medicaid funds. The States claim that&para;<br>&para;<br>50&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>this threat serves no purpose other than to force unwilling&para;<br>States to sign up for the dramatic expansion in health care&para;<br>coverage effected by the Act.&para;<br>Given the nature of the threat and the programs at&para;<br>issue here, we must agree. We have upheld Congress’s&para;<br>authority to condition the receipt of funds on the States’&para;<br>complying with restrictions on the use of those funds,&para;<br>because that is the means by which Congress ensures that&para;<br>the funds are spent according to its view of the “general&para;<br>Welfare.” Conditions that do not here govern the use&para;<br>of the funds, however, cannot be justified on that basis. When, for example, such conditions take the form of&para;<br>threats to terminate other significant independent grants,&para;<br>the conditions are properly viewed as a means of pressuring the States to accept policy changes.&para;<br>In South Dakota v. Dole, we considered a challenge to a&para;<br>federal law that threatened to withhold five percent of a&para;<br>State’s federal highway funds if the State did not raise its&para;<br>drinking age to 21. The Court found that the condition&para;<br>was “directly related to one of the main purposes for which&para;<br>highway funds are expended—safe interstate travel.” 483&para;<br>U. S., at 208. At the same time, the condition was not a&para;<br>restriction on how the highway funds—set aside for specific highway improvement and maintenance efforts—were&para;<br>to be used.&para;<br>We accordingly asked whether “the financial inducement offered by Congress” was “so coercive as to pass the&para;<br>point at which ‘pressure turns into compulsion.’ ” Id., at&para;<br>211 (quoting Steward Machine, supra, at 590). By “financial inducement” the Court meant the threat of losing five&para;<br>percent of highway funds; no new money was offered to&para;<br>the States to raise their drinking ages. We found that the&para;<br>inducement was not impermissibly coercive, because&para;<br>Congress was offering only “relatively mild encouragement&para;<br>to the States.” Dole, 483 U. S., at 211. We observed that&para;<br>“all South Dakota would lose if she adheres to her chosen&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>51&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>course as to a suitable minimum drinking age is 5%” of&para;<br>her highway funds. Ibid. In fact, the federal funds at&para;<br>stake constituted less than half of one percent of South&para;<br>Dakota’s budget at the time. See Nat. Assn. of State&para;<br>Budget Officers, The State Expenditure Report 59 (1987);&para;<br>South Dakota v. Dole, 791 F. 2d 628, 630 (CA8 1986). In&para;<br>consequence, “we conclude[d] that [the] encouragement&para;<br>to state action [was] a valid use of the spending power.”&para;<br>Dole, 483 U. S., at 212. Whether to accept the drinking&para;<br>age change “remain[ed] the prerogative of the States not&para;<br>merely in theory but in fact.” Id., at 211–212.&para;<br>In this case, the financial “inducement” Congress has&para;<br>chosen is much more than “relatively mild encouragement”—it is a gun to the head. Section 1396c of the Medicaid Act provides that if a State’s Medicaid plan does&para;<br>not comply with the Act’s requirements, the Secretary of&para;<br>Health and Human Services may declare that “further&para;<br>payments will not be made to the State.” 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1396c. A State that opts out of the Affordable Care Act’s&para;<br>expansion in health care coverage thus stands to lose not&para;<br>merely “a relatively small percentage” of its existing Medicaid funding, but all of it. Dole, supra, at 211. Medicaid&para;<br>spending accounts for over 20 percent of the average&para;<br>State’s total budget, with federal funds covering 50 to 83&para;<br>percent of those costs. See Nat. Assn. of State Budget&para;<br>Officers, Fiscal Year 2010 State Expenditure Report, p. 11,&para;<br>Table 5 (2011); 42 U. S. C. §1396d(b).

Brief for United States 10,&para;<br>n. 6. In addition, the States have developed intricate&para;<br>statutory and administrative regimes over the course of&para;<br>many decades to implement their objectives under existing&para;<br>Medicaid. It is easy to see how the Dole Court could conclude that the threatened loss of less than half of one&para;<br>percent of South Dakota’s budget left that State with a&para;<br>&para;<br>52&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

The&para;<br>threatened loss of over 10 percent of a State’s overall&para;<br>budget, in contrast, is economic dragooning that leaves the&para;<br>States with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid&para;<br>expansion.12&para;<br>JUSTICE GINSBURG claims that Dole is distinguishable&para;<br>because here “Congress has not threatened to withhold&para;<br>funds earmarked for any other program.” Post, at 47. But&para;<br>that begs the question: The States contend that the expansion is in reality a new program and that Congress is&para;<br>forcing them to accept it by threatening the funds for the&para;<br>existing Medicaid program. We cannot agree that existing&para;<br>Medicaid and the expansion dictated by the Affordable&para;<br>Care Act are all one program simply because “Congress&para;<br>styled” them as such. Post, at 49. If the expansion is not&para;<br>properly viewed as a modification of the existing Medicaid&para;<br>program, Congress’s decision to so title it is irrelevant.13&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 JUSTICE&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG observes that state Medicaid spending will increase by only 0.8 percent after the expansion. Post, at 43. That not&para;<br>only ignores increased state administrative expenses, but also assumes&para;<br>that the Federal Government will continue to fund the expansion at the&para;<br>current statutorily specified levels. It is not unheard of, however, for&para;<br>the Federal Government to increase requirements in such a manner as&para;<br>to impose unfunded mandates on the States. More importantly, the&para;<br>size of the new financial burden imposed on a State is irrelevant in&para;<br>analyzing whether the State has been coerced into accepting that&para;<br>burden. “Your money or your life” is a coercive proposition, whether&para;<br>you have a single dollar in your pocket or $500.&para;<br>13 Nor, of course, can the number of pages the amendment occupies, or the extent to which the change preserves and works within&para;<br>the existing program, be dispositive. Cf. post, at 49–50 (opinion of&para;<br>GINSBURG, J.). Take, for example, the following hypothetical amendment: “All of a State’s citizens are now eligible for Medicaid.” That&para;<br>change would take up a single line and would not alter any “operational&para;<br>aspect[ ] of the program” beyond the eligibility requirements. Post, at&para;<br>49. Yet it could hardly be argued that such an amendment was a&para;<br>permissible modification of Medicaid, rather than an attempt to foist an&para;<br>entirely new health care system upon the States.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>53&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Here, the Government claims that the Medicaid expansion is properly viewed merely as a modification of the existing program because the States agreed that Congress&para;<br>could change the terms of Medicaid when they signed on&para;<br>in the first place. The Government observes that the&para;<br>Social Security Act, which includes the original Medicaid&para;<br>provisions, contains a clause expressly reserving “[t]he&para;<br>right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision” of that&para;<br>statute. 42 U. S. C. §1304. So it does. But “if Congress&para;<br>intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.” Pennhurst, 451 U. S.,&para;<br>at 17. A State confronted with statutory language reserving the right to “alter” or “amend” the pertinent provisions&para;<br>of the Social Security Act might reasonably assume that&para;<br>Congress was entitled to make adjustments to the Medicaid program as it developed. Congress has in fact done&para;<br>so, sometimes conditioning only the new funding, other&para;<br>times both old and new. See, e.g., Social Security Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 1381–1382, 1465 (extending Medicaid eligibility, but partly conditioning only the new&para;<br>funding); Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990,&para;<br>§4601, 104 Stat. 1388–166 (extending eligibility, and&para;<br>conditioning old and new funds).&para;<br>The Medicaid expansion, however, accomplishes a shift&para;<br>in kind, not merely degree. The original program was designed to cover medical services for four particular categories of the needy: the disabled, the blind, the elderly,&para;<br>and needy families with dependent children. See 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §1396a(a)(10). Previous amendments to Medicaid&para;<br>eligibility merely altered and expanded the boundaries of&para;<br>these categories. Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid&para;<br>is transformed into a program to meet the health care&para;<br>needs of the entire nonelderly population with income&para;<br>below 133 percent of the poverty level. It is no longer a&para;<br>program to care for the neediest among us, but rather an&para;<br>element of a comprehensive national plan to provide uni-&para;<br>&para;<br>54&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>versal health insurance coverage.14&para;<br>Indeed, the manner in which the expansion is structured indicates that while Congress may have styled the&para;<br>expansion a mere alteration of existing Medicaid, it recognized it was enlisting the States in a new health care&para;<br>program. Congress created a separate funding provision&para;<br>to cover the costs of providing services to any person&para;<br>made newly eligible by the expansion. While Congress pays&para;<br>50 to 83 percent of the costs of covering individuals currently enrolled in Medicaid, §1396d(b), once the expansion is&para;<br>fully implemented Congress will pay 90 percent of the&para;<br>costs for newly eligible persons, §1396d(y)(1). The conditions on use of the different funds are also distinct. Congress mandated that newly eligible persons receive a level&para;<br>of coverage that is less comprehensive than the traditional&para;<br>Medicaid benefit package. §1396a(k)(1); see Brief for&para;<br>United States 9.&para;<br>As we have explained, “[t]hough Congress’ power to&para;<br>legislate under the spending power is broad, it does not&para;<br>include surprising participating States with postacceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.” Pennhurst, supra, at&para;<br>25. A State could hardly anticipate that Congress’s reservation of the right to “alter” or “amend” the Medicaid&para;<br>program included the power to transform it so dramatically.&para;<br>JUSTICE GINSBURG claims that in fact this expansion is&para;<br>——————&para;<br>14 JUSTICE GINSBURG suggests that the States can have no objection to&para;<br>the Medicaid expansion, because “Congress could have repealed Medicaid [and,] [t]hereafter, . . . could have enacted Medicaid II, a new&para;<br>program combining the pre-2010 coverage with the expanded coverage&para;<br>required by the ACA.” Post, at 51; see also post, at 38. But it would&para;<br>certainly not be that easy. Practical constraints would plainly inhibit,&para;<br>if not preclude, the Federal Government from repealing the existing&para;<br>program and putting every feature of Medicaid on the table for political&para;<br>reconsideration. Such a massive undertaking would hardly be “ritualistic.” Ibid. The same is true of JUSTICE GINSBURG’s suggestion that&para;<br>Congress could establish Medicaid as an exclusively federal program.&para;<br>Post, at 44.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>55&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>no different from the previous changes to Medicaid, such&para;<br>that “a State would be hard put to complain that it lacked&para;<br>fair notice.” Post, at 56. But the prior change she discusses—presumably the most dramatic alteration she could&para;<br>find—does not come close to working the transformation&para;<br>the expansion accomplishes. She highlights an amendment requiring States to cover pregnant women and increasing the number of eligible children. Ibid. But this&para;<br>modification can hardly be described as a major change in&para;<br>a program that—from its inception—provided health care&para;<br>for “families with dependent children.” Previous Medicaid&para;<br>amendments simply do not fall into the same category as&para;<br>the one at stake here.&para;<br>The Court in Steward Machine did not attempt to “fix&para;<br>the outermost line” where persuasion gives way to coercion. 301 U. S., at 591. The Court found it “[e]nough for&para;<br>present purposes that wherever the line may be, this&para;<br>statute is within it.” Ibid. We have no need to fix a line&para;<br>either. It is enough for today that wherever that line may&para;<br>be, this statute is surely beyond it. Congress may not&para;<br>simply “conscript state [agencies] into the national bureaucratic army,” FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 775&para;<br>(1982) (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and&para;<br>dissenting in part), and that is what it is attempting to do&para;<br>with the Medicaid expansion.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering&para;<br>funds under the Affordable Care Act to expand the availability of health care, and requiring that States accepting&para;<br>such funds comply with the conditions on their use. What&para;<br>Congress is not free to do is to penalize States that choose&para;<br>not to participate in that new program by taking away&para;<br>their existing Medicaid funding. Section 1396c gives the&para;<br>Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to&para;<br>&para;<br>56&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.&para;<br>&para;<br>do just that. It allows her to withhold all “further [Medicaid] payments . . . to the State” if she determines that the&para;<br>State is out of compliance with any Medicaid requirement,&para;<br>including those contained in the expansion. 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1396c. In light of the Court’s holding, the Secretary&para;<br>cannot apply §1396c to withdraw existing Medicaid funds&para;<br>for failure to comply with the requirements set out in the&para;<br>expansion.&para;<br>That fully remedies the constitutional violation we have&para;<br>identified. The chapter of the United States Code that&para;<br>contains §1396c includes a severability clause confirming&para;<br>that we need go no further. That clause specifies that “[i]f&para;<br>any provision of this chapter, or the application thereof to&para;<br>any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder&para;<br>of the chapter, and the application of such provision to&para;<br>other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.”&para;<br>§1303. Today’s holding does not affect the continued application of §1396c to the existing Medicaid program. Nor&para;<br>does it affect the Secretary’s ability to withdraw funds provided under the Affordable Care Act if a State that has&para;<br>chosen to participate in the expansion fails to comply with&para;<br>the requirements of that Act.&para;<br>This is not to say, as the joint dissent suggests, that we&para;<br>are “rewriting the Medicaid Expansion.” Post, at 48.&para;<br>Instead, we determine, first, that §1396c is unconstitutional when applied to withdraw existing Medicaid funds&para;<br>from States that decline to comply with the expansion.&para;<br>We then follow Congress’s explicit textual instruction to&para;<br>leave unaffected “the remainder of the chapter, and the&para;<br>application of [the challenged] provision to other persons&para;<br>or circumstances.” §1303. When we invalidate an application of a statute because that application is unconstitutional, we are not “rewriting” the statute; we are merely&para;<br>enforcing the Constitution.&para;<br>The question remains whether today’s holding affects&para;<br>other provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In considering&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>57&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ROBERTS, C.

Planned&para;<br>Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 330&para;<br>(2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). The question&para;<br>here is whether Congress would have wanted the rest of&para;<br>the Act to stand, had it known that States would have a&para;<br>genuine choice whether to participate in the new Medicaid&para;<br>expansion. Unless it is “evident” that the answer is no, we&para;<br>must leave the rest of the Act intact. Champlin Refining&para;<br>Co. v. Corporation Comm’n of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234&para;<br>(1932).&para;<br>We are confident that Congress would have wanted to&para;<br>preserve the rest of the Act. It is fair to say that Congress&para;<br>assumed that every State would participate in the Medicaid expansion, given that States had no real choice but to&para;<br>do so. The States contend that Congress enacted the rest&para;<br>of the Act with such full participation in mind; they point&para;<br>out that Congress made Medicaid a means for satisfying&para;<br>the mandate, 26 U. S. C. §5000A(f)(1)(A)(ii), and enacted&para;<br>no other plan for providing coverage to many low-income&para;<br>individuals. According to the States, this means that the&para;<br>entire Act must fall.&para;<br>We disagree. The Court today limits the financial pressure the Secretary may apply to induce States to accept&para;<br>the terms of the Medicaid expansion. As a practical matter, that means States may now choose to reject the expansion; that is the whole point. But that does not mean&para;<br>all or even any will. Some States may indeed decline to&para;<br>participate, either because they are unsure they will be&para;<br>able to afford their share of the new funding obligations,&para;<br>or because they are unwilling to commit the administra-&para;<br>&para;<br>58&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

Other&para;<br>States, however, may voluntarily sign up, finding the idea&para;<br>of expanding Medicaid coverage attractive, particularly&para;<br>given the level of federal funding the Act offers at the&para;<br>outset.&para;<br>We have no way of knowing how many States will accept the terms of the expansion, but we do not believe&para;<br>Congress would have wanted the whole Act to fall, simply&para;<br>because some may choose not to participate. The other&para;<br>reforms Congress enacted, after all, will remain “fully&para;<br>operative as a law,” Champlin, supra, at 234, and will still&para;<br>function in a way “consistent with Congress’ basic objectives in enacting the statute,” Booker, supra, at 259.&para;<br>Confident that Congress would not have intended anything different, we conclude that the rest of the Act need&para;<br>not fall in light of our constitutional holding.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The Affordable Care Act is constitutional in part and&para;<br>unconstitutional in part. The individual mandate cannot&para;<br>be upheld as an exercise of Congress’s power under the&para;<br>Commerce Clause. That Clause authorizes Congress to&para;<br>regulate interstate commerce, not to order individuals to&para;<br>engage in it. In this case, however, it is reasonable to construe what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those&para;<br>who have a certain amount of income, but choose to go&para;<br>without health insurance. Such legislation is within Congress’s power to tax.&para;<br>As for the Medicaid expansion, that portion of the Affordable Care Act violates the Constitution by threatening&para;<br>existing Medicaid funding. Congress has no authority to&para;<br>order the States to regulate according to its instructions.&para;<br>Congress may offer the States grants and require the&para;<br>States to comply with accompanying conditions, but the&para;<br>States must have a genuine choice whether to accept the&para;<br>offer.

In the Social Security Act, Congress installed a federal system to provide&para;<br>monthly benefits to retired wage earners and, eventually,&para;<br>to their survivors. Beyond question, Congress could have&para;<br>adopted a similar scheme for health care. Congress chose,&para;<br>instead, to preserve a central role for private insurers and&para;<br>state governments. According to THE CHIEF JUSTICE, the&para;<br>Commerce Clause does not permit that preservation. This&para;<br>rigid reading of the Clause makes scant sense and is&para;<br>stunningly retrogressive.&para;<br>Since 1937, our precedent has recognized Congress’&para;<br>large authority to set the Nation’s course in the economic&para;<br>and social welfare realm.

Unlike markets for most products,&para;<br>however, the inability to pay for care does not mean that&para;<br>an uninsured individual will receive no care. Federal and&para;<br>state law, as well as professional obligations and embed­&para;<br>ded social norms, require hospitals and physicians to&para;<br>provide care when it is most needed, regardless of the&para;<br>patient’s ability to pay.

S. residents. See 42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(C)&para;<br>and (I) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). The minimum coverage&para;<br>provision advances this objective by giving potential recip­&para;<br>ients of health care a financial incentive to acquire insur­&para;<br>ance. Per the minimum coverage provision, an individual&para;<br>must either obtain insurance or pay a toll constructed as a&para;<br>tax penalty. See 26 U. S.

Congress knew that encouraging individuals to&para;<br>purchase insurance would not suffice to solve the problem,&para;<br>because most of the uninsured are not uninsured by&para;<br>choice.1 Of particular concern to Congress were people&para;<br>who, though desperately in need of insurance, often cannot&para;<br>acquire it: persons who suffer from preexisting medical&para;<br>conditions.&para;<br>Before the ACA’s enactment, private insurance compa­&para;<br>nies took an applicant’s medical history into account when&para;<br>setting insurance rates or deciding whether to insure an&para;<br>individual.

First, Congress imposed a “guaranteed is­&para;<br>sue” requirement, which bars insurers from denying&para;<br>coverage to any person on account of that person’s medical&para;<br>condition or history. See 42 U. S. C. §§300gg–1, 300gg–3,&para;<br>300gg–4(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). Second, Congress required&para;<br>insurers to use “community rating” to price their insurance&para;<br>policies. See §300gg. Community rating, in effect, bars&para;<br>insurance companies from charging higher premiums&para;<br>to those with preexisting conditions.&para;<br>But these two provisions, Congress comprehended, could&para;<br>not work effectively unless individuals were given a pow­&para;<br>erful incentive to obtain insurance. See Hearings before&para;<br>the House Ways and Means Committee, 111th Cong., 1st&para;<br>Sess., 10, 13 (2009) (statement of Uwe Reinhardt) (“[I]mposition of community-rated premiums and guaranteed&para;<br>issue on a market of competing private health insurers&para;<br>will inexorably drive that market into extinction, unless&para;<br>these two features are coupled with . . . a mandate on&para;<br>individual[s] to be insured.” (emphasis in original)).&para;<br>In the 1990’s, several States—including New York, New&para;<br>Jersey, Washington, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire,&para;<br>and Vermont—enacted guaranteed-issue and community­&para;<br>rating laws without requiring universal acquisition of&para;<br>insurance coverage.

See supra, at 7–8.&para;<br>Not only do those without insurance consume a large&para;<br>amount of health care each year; critically, as earlier&para;<br>explained, their inability to pay for a significant portion of&para;<br>that consumption drives up market prices, foists costs on&para;<br>other consumers, and reduces market efficiency and sta­&para;<br>bility. See supra, at 5–7. Given these far-reaching effects&para;<br>on interstate commerce, the decision to forgo insurance is&para;<br>hardly inconsequential or equivalent to “doing nothing,”&para;<br>ante, at 20; it is, instead, an economic decision Congress&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

By requiring those who&para;<br>do not carry insurance to pay a toll, the minimum cover­&para;<br>age provision gives individuals a strong incentive to in­&para;<br>sure. This incentive, Congress had good reason to believe,&para;<br>would reduce the number of uninsured and, correspond­&para;<br>ingly, mitigate the adverse impact the uninsured have on&para;<br>the national health-care market.&para;<br>Congress also acted reasonably in requiring uninsured&para;<br>individuals, whether sick or healthy, either to obtain&para;<br>insurance or to pay the specified penalty. As earlier ob­&para;<br>served, because every person is at risk of needing care at&para;<br>any moment, all those who lack insurance, regardless of&para;<br>their current health status, adversely affect the price of&para;<br>health care and health insurance. See supra, at 6–7.&para;<br>Moreover, an insurance-purchase requirement limited to&para;<br>those in need of immediate care simply could not work.&para;<br>Insurance companies would either charge these individu­&para;<br>als prohibitively expensive premiums, or, if community­&para;<br>rating regulations were in place, close up shop.

Congress’ enactment&para;<br>of the minimum coverage provision, which addresses a&para;<br>specific interstate problem in a practical, experience­&para;<br>informed manner, easily meets this criterion.&para;<br>D&para;<br>Rather than evaluating the constitutionality of the&para;<br>minimum coverage provision in the manner established by&para;<br>our precedents, THE CHIEF JUSTICE relies on a newly&para;<br>minted constitutional doctrine. The commerce power does&para;<br>not, THE CHIEF JUSTICE announces, permit Congress&para;<br>to “compe[l] individuals to become active in commerce&para;<br>by purchasing a product.” Ante, at 20 (emphasis deleted).&para;<br>1&para;<br>a&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s novel constraint on Congress’&para;<br>commerce power gains no force from our precedent and for&para;<br>that reason alone warrants disapprobation. See infra, at&para;<br>23–27. But even assuming, for the moment, that Congress&para;<br>lacks authority under the Commerce Clause to “compel&para;<br>individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an&para;<br>unwanted product,” ante, at 18, such a limitation would be&para;<br>inapplicable here. Everyone will, at some point, consume&para;<br>health-care products and services. See supra, at 3. Thus,&para;<br>if THE CHIEF JUSTICE is correct that an insurance­&para;<br>purchase requirement can be applied only to those who&para;<br>“actively” consume health care, the minimum coverage&para;<br>provision fits the bill.&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE does not dispute that all U. S. resi­&para;<br>dents participate in the market for health services over&para;<br>the course of their lives. See ante, at 16 (“Everyone will&para;<br>eventually need health care at a time and to an extent&para;<br>they cannot predict.”). But, THE CHIEF JUSTICE insists,&para;<br>the uninsured cannot be considered active in the market&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

First, more than&para;<br>60% of those without insurance visit a hospital or doctor’s&para;<br>office each year. See supra, at 5. Nearly 90% will within&para;<br>five years.4 An uninsured’s consumption of health care is&para;<br>thus quite proximate: It is virtually certain to occur in the&para;<br>next five years and more likely than not to occur this year.&para;<br>Equally evident, Congress has no way of separating&para;<br>those uninsured individuals who will need emergency medical care today (surely their consumption of medical care&para;<br>is sufficiently imminent) from those who will not need&para;<br>medical services for years to come. No one knows when an&para;<br>emergency will occur, yet emergencies involving the unin­&para;<br>sured arise daily. To capture individuals who unexpectedly will obtain medical care in the very near future, then,&para;<br>Congress needed to include individuals who will not go to&para;<br>a doctor anytime soon. Congress, our decisions instruct,&para;<br>has authority to cast its net that wide. See Perez v. United&para;<br>States, 402 U. S. 146, 154 (1971) (“[W]hen it is necessary&para;<br>in order to prevent an evil to make the law embrace more&para;<br>than the precise thing to be prevented it may do so.” (in­&para;<br>ternal quotation marks omitted)).5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 See Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Center for&para;<br>Health Statistics, Summary Health Statistics for U.

This criticism&para;<br>ignores the reality that a healthy young person may be a day away&para;<br>from needing health care. See supra, at 4.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE defines the health-care market as including only those transactions that will occur&para;<br>either in the next instant or within some (unspecified)&para;<br>proximity to the next instant. But Congress could reason­&para;<br>ably have viewed the market from a long-term perspective,&para;<br>encompassing all transactions virtually certain to occur&para;<br>over the next decade, see supra, at 19, not just those oc­&para;<br>curring here and now.&para;<br>Third, contrary to THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s contention, our&para;<br>precedent does indeed support “[t]he proposition that&para;<br>Congress may dictate the conduct of an individual today&para;<br>because of prophesied future activity.” Ante, at 26. In&para;<br>Wickard, the Court upheld a penalty the Federal Govern­&para;<br>ment imposed on a farmer who grew more wheat than he&para;<br>was permitted to grow under the Agricultural Adjustment&para;<br>Act of 1938 (AAA). 317 U. S., at 114–115. He could not&para;<br>be penalized, the farmer argued, as he was growing the&para;<br>wheat for home consumption, not for sale on the open&para;<br>market. Id., at 119. The Court rejected this argument.&para;<br>Id., at 127–129. Wheat intended for home consumption,&para;<br>the Court noted, “overhangs the market, and if induced by&para;<br>rising prices, tends to flow into the market and check price&para;<br>increases [intended by the AAA].” Id., at 128.&para;<br>Similar reasoning supported the Court’s judgment in&para;<br>Raich, which upheld Congress’ authority to regulate mari­&para;<br>juana grown for personal use. 545 U. S., at 19. Home­&para;<br>grown marijuana substantially affects the interstate market for marijuana, we observed, for “the high demand in&para;<br>the interstate market will [likely] draw such marijuana&para;<br>into that market.” Ibid.&para;<br>Our decisions thus acknowledge Congress’ authority,&para;<br>under the Commerce Clause, to direct the conduct of an&para;<br>individual today (the farmer in Wickard, stopped from&para;<br>growing excess wheat; the plaintiff in Raich, ordered to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

Congress’ actions&para;<br>are even more rational in this case, where the future&para;<br>activity (the consumption of medical care) is certain to&para;<br>occur, the sole uncertainty being the time the activity will&para;<br>take place.&para;<br>Maintaining that the uninsured are not active in the&para;<br>health-care market, THE CHIEF JUSTICE draws an analogy&para;<br>to the car market. An individual “is not ‘active in the car&para;<br>market,’ ” THE CHIEF JUSTICE observes, simply because he&para;<br>or she may someday buy a car. Ante, at 25. The analogy&para;<br>is inapt. The inevitable yet unpredictable need for medi­&para;<br>cal care and the guarantee that emergency care will be&para;<br>provided when required are conditions nonexistent in&para;<br>other markets. That is so of the market for cars, and of&para;<br>the market for broccoli as well. Although an individual&para;<br>might buy a car or a crown of broccoli one day, there is no&para;<br>certainty she will ever do so. And if she eventually wants&para;<br>a car or has a craving for broccoli, she will be obliged to&para;<br>pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nour­&para;<br>ishment. She will get no free ride or food, at the expense&para;<br>of another consumer forced to pay an inflated price. See&para;<br>Thomas More Law Center v. Obama, 651 F. 3d 529, 565&para;<br>(CA6 2011) (Sutton, J., concurring in part) (“Regulating&para;<br>how citizens pay for what they already receive (health&para;<br>care), never quite know when they will need, and in the&para;<br>case of severe illnesses or emergencies generally will not&para;<br>be able to afford, has few (if any) parallels in modern&para;<br>life.”). Upholding the minimum coverage provision on the&para;<br>ground that all are participants or will be participants in&para;<br>the health-care market would therefore carry no implica­&para;<br>tion that Congress may justify under the Commerce&para;<br>Clause a mandate to buy other products and services.&para;<br>Nor is it accurate to say that the minimum coverage&para;<br>provision “compel[s] individuals . . . to purchase an un­&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

If unwanted today, medical service secured by&para;<br>insurance may be desperately needed tomorrow. Virtually&para;<br>everyone, I reiterate, consumes health care at some point&para;<br>in his or her life. See supra, at 3. Health insurance is a&para;<br>means of paying for this care, nothing more. In requiring&para;<br>individuals to obtain insurance, Congress is therefore not&para;<br>mandating the purchase of a discrete, unwanted product.&para;<br>Rather, Congress is merely defining the terms on which&para;<br>individuals pay for an interstate good they consume:&para;<br>Persons subject to the mandate must now pay for medical&para;<br>care in advance (instead of at the point of service) and&para;<br>through insurance (instead of out of pocket). Establishing&para;<br>payment terms for goods in or affecting interstate com­&para;<br>merce is quintessential economic regulation well within&para;<br>Congress’ domain. See, e.g., United States v. Wrightwood&para;<br>Dairy Co., 315 U. S. 110, 118 (1942). Cf. post, at 13 (joint&para;<br>opinion of SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ.)&para;<br>(recognizing that “the Federal Government can prescribe&para;<br>[a commodity’s] quality . . . and even [its price]”).&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE also calls the minimum coverage&para;<br>provision an illegitimate effort to make young, healthy&para;<br>individuals subsidize insurance premiums paid by the less&para;<br>hale and hardy. See ante, at 17, 25–26. This complaint,&para;<br>too, is spurious. Under the current health-care system,&para;<br>healthy persons who lack insurance receive a benefit for&para;<br>which they do not pay: They are assured that, if they need&para;<br>it, emergency medical care will be available, although they&para;<br>cannot afford it. See supra, at 5–6. Those who have in­&para;<br>surance bear the cost of this guarantee. See ibid. By&para;<br>requiring the healthy uninsured to obtain insurance or&para;<br>pay a penalty structured as a tax, the minimum coverage&para;<br>provision ends the free ride these individuals currently&para;<br>enjoy.&para;<br>In the fullness of time, moreover, today’s young and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

Viewed over&para;<br>a lifespan, the costs and benefits even out: The young who&para;<br>pay more than their fair share currently will pay less than&para;<br>their fair share when they become senior citizens. And&para;<br>even if, as undoubtedly will be the case, some individuals,&para;<br>over their lifespans, will pay more for health insurance&para;<br>than they receive in health services, they have little to&para;<br>complain about, for that is how insurance works. Every&para;<br>insured person receives protection against a catastrophic&para;<br>loss, even though only a subset of the covered class will&para;<br>ultimately need that protection.&para;<br>b&para;<br>In any event, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s limitation of the&para;<br>commerce power to the regulation of those actively en­&para;<br>gaged in commerce finds no home in the text of the Consti­&para;<br>tution or our decisions. Article I, §8, of the Constitution&para;<br>grants Congress the power “[t]o regulate Commerce . . .&para;<br>among the several States.” Nothing in this language implies that Congress’ commerce power is limited to regulating those actively engaged in commercial transactions.&para;<br>Indeed, as the D. C. Circuit observed, “[a]t the time the&para;<br>Constitution was [framed], to ‘regulate’ meant,” among&para;<br>other things, “to require action.” See Seven-Sky v. Holder,&para;<br>661 F. 3d 1, 16 (2011).&para;<br>Arguing to the contrary, THE CHIEF JUSTICE notes that&para;<br>“the Constitution gives Congress the power to ‘coin&para;<br>Money,’ in addition to the power to ‘regulate the Value&para;<br>thereof,’ ” and similarly “gives Congress the power to ‘raise&para;<br>and support Armies’ and to ‘provide and maintain a Navy,’ in&para;<br>addition to the power to ‘make Rules for the Government&para;<br>and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.’ ” Ante, at&para;<br>18–19 (citing Art. I, §8, cls. 5, 12–14). In separating the&para;<br>power to regulate from the power to bring the subject of&para;<br>the regulation into existence, THE CHIEF JUSTICE asserts,&para;<br>“[t]he language of the Constitution reflects the natural&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of GINSBURG, J. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>understanding that the power to regulate assumes there is&para;<br>already something to be regulated.” Ante, at 19.&para;<br>This argument is difficult to fathom. Requiring individ­&para;<br>uals to obtain insurance unquestionably regulates the inter­&para;<br>state health-insurance and health-care markets, both of&para;<br>them in existence well before the enactment of the ACA.&para;<br>See Wickard, 317 U. S., at 128 (“The stimulation of com­&para;<br>merce is a use of the regulatory function quite as definitely&para;<br>as prohibitions or restrictions thereon.”). Thus, the “some­&para;<br>thing to be regulated” was surely there when Congress&para;<br>created the minimum coverage provision.6&para;<br>Nor does our case law toe the activity versus inactiv­&para;<br>ity line. In Wickard, for example, we upheld the penalty&para;<br>imposed on a farmer who grew too much wheat, even&para;<br>though the regulation had the effect of compelling farmers&para;<br>to purchase wheat in the open market. Id., at 127–129.&para;<br>“[F]orcing some farmers into the market to buy what they&para;<br>could provide for themselves” was, the Court held, a valid&para;<br>means of regulating commerce. Id., at 128–129. In another context, this Court similarly upheld Congress’ author­&para;<br>ity under the commerce power to compel an “inactive” land­&para;<br>holder to submit to an unwanted sale. See Monongahela&para;<br>Nav. Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 312, 335–337 (1893)&para;<br>(“[U]pon the [great] power to regulate commerce[,]” Con­&para;<br>gress has the authority to mandate the sale of real property to the Government, where the sale is essential to the&para;<br>improvement of a navigable waterway (emphasis added));&para;<br>Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. Co., 135 U. S. 641,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 THE&para;<br>&para;<br>CHIEF JUSTICE’s reliance on the quoted passages of the Consti­&para;<br>tution, see ante, at 18–19, is also dubious on other grounds. The power&para;<br>to “regulate the Value” of the national currency presumably includes&para;<br>the power to increase the currency’s worth—i.e., to create value where&para;<br>none previously existed. And if the power to “[r]egulat[e] . . . the land&para;<br>and naval Forces” presupposes “there is already [in existence] some­&para;<br>thing to be regulated,” i.e., an Army and a Navy, does Congress lack&para;<br>authority to create an Air Force?&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

Wickard,&para;<br>317 U. S., at 122 (internal quotation marks omitted). See&para;<br>also supra, at 14–16. This Court’s former endeavors to&para;<br>impose categorical limits on the commerce power have not&para;<br>fared well. In several pre-New Deal cases, the Court&para;<br>attempted to cabin Congress’ Commerce Clause authority&para;<br>by distinguishing “commerce” from activity once conceived&para;<br>to be noncommercial, notably, “production,” “mining,” and&para;<br>“manufacturing.” See, e.g., United States v. E. C. Knight&para;<br>Co., 156 U. S. 1, 12 (1895) (“Commerce succeeds to manu­&para;<br>facture, and is not a part of it.”); Carter v. Carter Coal Co.,&para;<br>298 U. S. 238, 304 (1936) (“Mining brings the subject&para;<br>matter of commerce into existence. Commerce disposes of&para;<br>it.”). The Court also sought to distinguish activities hav­&para;<br>ing a “direct” effect on interstate commerce, and for that&para;<br>reason, subject to federal regulation, from those having&para;<br>only an “indirect” effect, and therefore not amenable to&para;<br>federal control. See, e.g., A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp.&para;<br>v. United States, 295 U. S. 495, 548 (1935) (“[T]he distinction between direct and indirect effects of intrastate&para;<br>transactions upon interstate commerce must be recognized&para;<br>as a fundamental one.”).&para;<br>These line-drawing exercises were untenable, and the&para;<br>Court long ago abandoned them. “[Q]uestions of the power&para;<br>of Congress [under the Commerce Clause],” we held in&para;<br>Wickard, “are not to be decided by reference to any formula which would give controlling force to nomenclature such&para;<br>as ‘production’ and ‘indirect’ and foreclose consideration of&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

See also Morrison,&para;<br>529 U. S., at 641–644 (Souter, J., dissenting) (recounting&para;<br>the Court’s “nearly disastrous experiment” with formalis­&para;<br>tic limits on Congress’ commerce power). Failing to learn&para;<br>from this history, THE CHIEF JUSTICE plows ahead with&para;<br>his formalistic distinction between those who are “active&para;<br>in commerce,” ante, at 20, and those who are not.&para;<br>It is not hard to show the difficulty courts (and Con­&para;<br>gress) would encounter in distinguishing statutes that reg­&para;<br>ulate “activity” from those that regulate “inactivity.” As&para;<br>Judge Easterbrook noted, “it is possible to restate most&para;<br>actions as corresponding inactions with the same effect.”&para;<br>Archie v. Racine, 847 F. 2d 1211, 1213 (CA7 1988) (en&para;<br>banc). Take this case as an example. An individual who&para;<br>opts not to purchase insurance from a private insurer can&para;<br>be seen as actively selecting another form of insurance:&para;<br>self-insurance. See Thomas More Law Center, 651 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 561 (Sutton, J., concurring in part) (“No one is in­&para;<br>active when deciding how to pay for health care, as self­&para;<br>insurance and private insurance are two forms of action&para;<br>for addressing the same risk.”). The minimum coverage&para;<br>provision could therefore be described as regulating activ­&para;<br>ists in the self-insurance market.7 Wickard is another&para;<br>example. Did the statute there at issue target activity&para;<br>(the growing of too much wheat) or inactivity (the farmer’s&para;<br>failure to purchase wheat in the marketplace)? If any­&para;<br>thing, the Court’s analysis suggested the latter. See 317&para;<br>U. S., at 127–129.&para;<br>At bottom, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s and the joint dissent­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s characterization of individuals who choose not&para;<br>to purchase private insurance as “doing nothing,” ante, at 20, is simi­&para;<br>larly questionable. A person who self-insures opts against prepayment for&para;<br>a product the person will in time consume. When aggregated, exercise&para;<br>of that option has a substantial impact on the health-care market. See&para;<br>supra, at 5–7, 16–17.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

See Lopez, 514 U. S., at&para;<br>567; Morrison, 529 U. S., at 617–619. In Lopez, for&para;<br>example, the Court held that the Federal Government&para;<br>lacked power, under the Commerce Clause, to criminalize&para;<br>the possession of a gun in a local school zone. Possessing&para;<br>a gun near a school, the Court reasoned, “is in no sense&para;<br>an economic activity that might, through repetition else­&para;<br>where, substantially affect any sort of interstate com­&para;<br>merce.” 514 U.

As an example of the type of regulation he&para;<br>fears, THE CHIEF JUSTICE cites a Government mandate to&para;<br>purchase green vegetables. Ante, at 22–23. One could call&para;<br>this concern “the broccoli horrible.” Congress, THE CHIEF&para;<br>JUSTICE posits, might adopt such a mandate, reasoning&para;<br>that an individual’s failure to eat a healthy diet, like the&para;<br>failure to purchase health insurance, imposes costs on&para;<br>others. See ibid.&para;<br>Consider the chain of inferences the Court would have&para;<br>to accept to conclude that a vegetable-purchase mandate&para;<br>was likely to have a substantial effect on the health-care&para;<br>costs borne by lithe Americans. The Court would have to&para;<br>believe that individuals forced to buy vegetables would&para;<br>then eat them (instead of throwing or giving them away),&para;<br>would prepare the vegetables in a healthy way (steamed&para;<br>or raw, not deep-fried), would cut back on unhealthy foods,&para;<br>and would not allow other factors (such as lack of exercise&para;<br>or little sleep) to trump the improved diet.9 Such “pil[ing&para;<br>of] inference upon inference” is just what the Court re­&para;<br>fused to do in Lopez and Morrison.&para;<br>Other provisions of the Constitution also check congres­&para;<br>sional overreaching. A mandate to purchase a particular product would be unconstitutional if, for example, the&para;<br>edict impermissibly abridged the freedom of speech, inter­&para;<br>fered with the free exercise of religion, or infringed on a&para;<br>liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The failure to purchase vegetables in THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s hypothet­&para;<br>ical, then, is not what leads to higher health-care costs for others;&para;<br>rather, it is the failure of individuals to maintain a healthy diet, and&para;<br>the resulting obesity, that creates the cost-shifting problem. See ante,&para;<br>at 22–23. Requiring individuals to purchase vegetables is thus&para;<br>several steps removed from solving the problem. The failure to obtain&para;<br>health insurance, by contrast, is the immediate cause of the cost-shifting&para;<br>Congress sought to address through the ACA.

To receive federal Medicaid funds,&para;<br>States must provide health benefits to specified categories&para;<br>of needy persons, including pregnant women, children,&para;<br>parents, and adults with disabilities. Guaranteed eligibil­&para;<br>ity varies by category: for some it is tied to the federal&para;<br>poverty level (incomes up to 100% or 133%); for others it&para;<br>depends on criteria such as eligibility for designated state&para;<br>or federal assistance programs. The ACA enlarges the&para;<br>population of needy people States must cover to include&para;<br>adults under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The spending power conferred by the&para;<br>Constitution, the Court has never doubted, permits Con­&para;<br>gress to define the contours of programs financed with&para;<br>federal funds. See, e.g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981). And to expand&para;<br>coverage, Congress could have recalled the existing legis­&para;<br>lation, and replaced it with a new law making Medicaid as&para;<br>embracive of the poor as Congress chose.&para;<br>The question posed by the 2010 Medicaid expansion,&para;<br>then, is essentially this: To cover a notably larger popula­&para;<br>tion, must Congress take the repeal/reenact route, or may&para;<br>it achieve the same result by amending existing law? The&para;<br>answer should be that Congress may expand by amend­&para;<br>ment the classes of needy persons entitled to Medicaid&para;<br>benefits. A ritualistic requirement that Congress repeal&para;<br>and reenact spending legislation in order to enlarge the&para;<br>population served by a federally funded program would&para;<br>advance no constitutional principle and would scarcely&para;<br>serve the interests of federalism.

Rather&para;<br>than authorizing a federal agency to administer a uniform national health-care system for the poor, Congress offered States the opportunity to tailor Medicaid&para;<br>grants to their particular needs, so long as they remain&para;<br>within bounds set by federal law. In shaping Medicaid,&para;<br>Congress did not endeavor to fix permanently the terms&para;<br>participating states must meet; instead, Congress re­&para;<br>served the “right to alter, amend, or repeal” any provision&para;<br>of the Medicaid Act. 42 U. S. C. §1304. States, for their&para;<br>part, agreed to amend their own Medicaid plans consistent&para;<br>with changes from time to time made in the federal law.&para;<br>See 42 CFR §430.12(c)(i) (2011). And from 1965 to the&para;<br>present, States have regularly conformed to Congress’&para;<br>alterations of the Medicaid Act.&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE acknowledges that Congress may&para;<br>“condition the receipt of [federal] funds on the States’&para;<br>complying with restrictions on the use of those funds,”&para;<br>ante, at 50, but nevertheless concludes that the 2010&para;<br>expansion is unduly coercive. His conclusion rests on&para;<br>three premises, each of them essential to his theory. First,&para;<br>the Medicaid expansion is, in THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s view, a&para;<br>new grant program, not an addition to the Medicaid pro­&para;<br>gram existing before the ACA’s enactment. Congress, THE&para;<br>CHIEF JUSTICE maintains, has threatened States with the&para;<br>loss of funds from an old program in an effort to get them&para;<br>to adopt a new one. Second, the expansion was unforesee­&para;<br>able by the States when they first signed on to Medicaid.&para;<br>Third, the threatened loss of funding is so large that the&para;<br>States have no real choice but to participate in the Medi­&para;<br>caid expansion. THE CHIEF JUSTICE therefore—for the&para;<br>first time ever—finds an exercise of Congress’ spending&para;<br>power unconstitutionally coercive.&para;<br>Medicaid, as amended by the ACA, however, is not two&para;<br>spending programs; it is a single program with a constant&para;<br>aim—to enable poor persons to receive basic health care&para;<br>&para;<br>40&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of GINSBURG, J. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>when they need it. Given past expansions, plus express&para;<br>statutory warning that Congress may change the re­&para;<br>quirements participating States must meet, there can be&para;<br>no tenable claim that the ACA fails for lack of notice.&para;<br>Moreover, States have no entitlement to receive any Medi­&para;<br>caid funds; they enjoy only the opportunity to accept funds&para;<br>on Congress’ terms. Future Congresses are not bound&para;<br>by their predecessors’ dispositions; they have authority to&para;<br>spend federal revenue as they see fit. The Federal Gov­&para;<br>ernment, therefore, is not, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE charges,&para;<br>threatening States with the loss of “existing” funds from&para;<br>one spending program in order to induce them to opt into&para;<br>another program. Congress is simply requiring States to&para;<br>do what States have long been required to do to receive&para;<br>Medicaid funding: comply with the conditions Congress&para;<br>prescribes for participation.&para;<br>A majority of the Court, however, buys the argument&para;<br>that prospective withholding of funds formerly available&para;<br>exceeds Congress’ spending power. Given that holding, I&para;<br>entirely agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE as to the appropri­&para;<br>ate remedy. It is to bar the withholding found impermis­&para;<br>sible—not, as the joint dissenters would have it, to scrap&para;<br>the expansion altogether, see post, at 46–48. The dissent­&para;<br>ers’ view that the ACA must fall in its entirety is a radical&para;<br>departure from the Court’s normal course. When a consti­&para;<br>tutional infirmity mars a statute, the Court ordinarily&para;<br>removes the infirmity. It undertakes a salvage operation;&para;<br>it does not demolish the legislation. See, e.g., Brockett v.&para;<br>Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 504 (1985) (Court’s&para;<br>normal course is to declare a statute invalid “to the extent&para;<br>that it reaches too far, but otherwise [to leave the statute]&para;<br>intact”). That course is plainly in order where, as in this&para;<br>case, Congress has expressly instructed courts to leave&para;<br>untouched every provision not found invalid. See 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §1303. Because THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds the&para;<br>withholding—not the granting—of federal funds incom­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

But if they did, the&para;<br>Federal Government paid at least half the costs. To qualify for these grants, States had to offer a minimum level of&para;<br>health coverage to beneficiaries of four federally funded,&para;<br>state-administered welfare programs: Aid to Families with&para;<br>Dependent Children; Old Age Assistance; Aid to the Blind;&para;<br>and Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled.

That Act directed the&para;<br>Secretary of Transportation to withhold 5% of the federal&para;<br>highway funds otherwise payable to a State if the State&para;<br>permitted purchase of alcoholic beverages by persons&para;<br>less than 21 years old. Drinking age was not within the&para;<br>authority of Congress to regulate, South Dakota argued,&para;<br>because the Twenty-First Amendment gave the States&para;<br>exclusive power to control the manufacture, transporta­&para;<br>tion, and consumption of alcoholic beverages. The small&para;<br>percentage of highway-construction funds South Dakota&para;<br>stood to lose by adhering to 19 as the age of eligibility to&para;<br>purchase 3.2% beer, however, was not enough to qualify as&para;<br>coercion, the Court concluded.&para;<br>This case does not present the concerns that led the&para;<br>Court in Dole even to consider the prospect of coercion.

See supra, at 44.&para;<br>That is what makes this such a simple case, and the&para;<br>Court’s decision so unsettling. Congress, aiming to assist&para;<br>the needy, has appropriated federal money to subsidize&para;<br>state health-insurance programs that meet federal stand­&para;<br>ards. The principal standard the ACA sets is that the&para;<br>state program cover adults earning no more than 133% of&para;<br>the federal poverty line. Enforcing that prescription en­&para;<br>sures that federal funds will be spent on health care for&para;<br>the poor in furtherance of Congress’ present perception of&para;<br>the general welfare.&para;<br>C&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE asserts that the Medicaid expan­&para;<br>sion creates a “new health care program.” Ante, at 54.&para;<br>Moreover, States could “hardly anticipate” that Congress&para;<br>would “transform [the program] so dramatically.” Ante,&para;<br>at 55. Therefore, THE CHIEF JUSTICE maintains, Congress’&para;<br>threat to withhold “old” Medicaid funds based on a State’s&para;<br>refusal to participate in the “new” program is a “threa[t] to&para;<br>terminate [an]other . . . independent gran[t].” Ante, at 50,&para;<br>52–53. And because the threat to withhold a large amount&para;<br>of funds from one program “leaves the States with no real&para;<br>option but to acquiesce [in a newly created program],” THE&para;<br>CHIEF JUSTICE concludes, the Medicaid expansion is un­&para;<br>constitutionally coercive. Ante, at 52.&para;<br>1&para;<br>The starting premise on which THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s&para;<br>coercion analysis rests is that the ACA did not really&para;<br>“extend” Medicaid; instead, Congress created an entirely&para;<br>new program to co-exist with the old. THE CHIEF JUSTICE&para;<br>calls the ACA new, but in truth, it simply reaches more of&para;<br>America’s poor than Congress originally covered.&para;<br>Medicaid was created to enable States to provide medi­&para;<br>cal assistance to “needy persons.” See S.

The Medicaid expansion leaves unchanged the vast&para;<br>majority of these provisions; it adds beneficiaries to the&para;<br>existing program and specifies the rate at which States&para;<br>will be reimbursed for services provided to the added beneficiaries.

Ibid. But the rate differs only in its&para;<br>generosity to participating States.

Id., at 17–18.

Ibid.&para;<br>Beginning in the late 1970’s, States increasingly exer­&para;<br>cised the option to withdraw. Id., at 46. Concerned that&para;<br>withdrawals were threatening the integrity of Social&para;<br>Security, Congress repealed the termination provision.&para;<br>Congress thereby changed Social Security from a program&para;<br>voluntary for the States to one from which they could not&para;<br>escape.

We unanimously&para;<br>rejected California’s argument. Id., at 51–53. By includ­&para;<br>ing in the Act “a clause expressly reserving to it ‘[t]he&para;<br>right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision’ of the Act,”&para;<br>we held, Congress put States on notice that the Act&para;<br>“created no contractual rights.” Id., at 51–52. The States&para;<br>therefore had no law-based ground on which to complain&para;<br>about the amendment, despite the significant character of&para;<br>the change.&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE nevertheless would rewrite §1304&para;<br>to countenance only the “right to alter somewhat,” or&para;<br>“amend, but not too much.” Congress, however, did not so&para;<br>qualify §1304. Indeed, Congress retained discretion to&para;<br>“repeal” Medicaid, wiping it out entirely. Cf. Delta Air&para;<br>Lines, Inc. v. August, 450 U. S. 346, 368 (1981) (Rehnquist,&para;<br>J., dissenting) (invoking “the common-sense maxim that&para;<br>the greater includes the lesser”). As Bowen indicates, no&para;<br>State could reasonably have read §1304 as reserving to&para;<br>Congress authority to make adjustments only if modestly&para;<br>sized.&para;<br>In fact, no State proceeded on that understanding. In com­&para;<br>pliance with Medicaid regulations, each State expressly&para;<br>undertook to abide by future Medicaid changes. See 42&para;<br>CFR §430.12(c)(1) (2011) (“The [state Medicaid] plan must&para;<br>provide that it will be amended whenever necessary to&para;<br>reflect . . .

Whenever a State&para;<br>notifies the Federal Government of a change in its own&para;<br>Medicaid program, the State certifies both that it knows&para;<br>the federally set terms of participation may change, and&para;<br>that it will abide by those changes as a condition of con­&para;<br>tinued participation. See, e.g., Florida Agency for Health&para;<br>Care Admin., State Plan Under Title XIX of the Social&para;<br>Security Act Medical Assistance Program §7.1, p. 86 (Oct.&para;<br>6, 1992).&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE insists that the most recent expan­&para;<br>sion, in contrast to its predecessors, “accomplishes a shift&para;<br>in kind, not merely degree.” Ante, at 53. But why was&para;<br>Medicaid altered only in degree, not in kind, when Con­&para;<br>gress required States to cover millions of children and&para;<br>pregnant women? See supra, at 41–42.

In short, given §1304, this Court’s con­&para;<br>struction of §1304’s language in Bowen, and the enlarge­&para;<br>ment of Medicaid in the years since 1965,23 a State would&para;<br>be hard put to complain that it lacked fair notice when,&para;<br>in 2010, Congress altered Medicaid to embrace a larger&para;<br>portion of the Nation’s poor.&para;<br>3&para;<br>THE CHIEF JUSTICE ultimately asks whether “the finan­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>23 Note, in this regard, the extension of Social Security, which began&para;<br>in 1935 as an old-age pension program, then expanded to include survivor benefits in 1939 and disability benefits in 1956.

We should not lightly&para;<br>ascribe to Congress an intent to violate the Constitution (at least as my&para;<br>colleagues read it). This is particularly true when the ACA could just&para;<br>as well be comprehended as demonstrating Congress’ mere expectation,&para;<br>in light of the uniformity of past participation and the generosity of the&para;<br>federal contribution, that States would not withdraw.

This, in turn,&para;<br>could limit a State’s capacity to replace a federal program with an&para;<br>“equivalent” state-funded analog. Post, at 40. But it cannot be true&para;<br>that “the amount of the federal taxes extracted from the taxpayers of a&para;<br>State to pay for the program in question is relevant in determining&para;<br>whether there is impermissible coercion.” Post, at 37.

It can assuredly do that, by exercising the powers accorded to it under the Constitution. The&para;<br>question in this case, however, is whether the complex&para;<br>structures and provisions of the Patient Protection and&para;<br>Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act or ACA) go beyond those powers. We conclude that they do.&para;<br>This case is in one respect difficult: it presents two&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>questions of first impression. The first of those is whether&para;<br>failure to engage in economic activity (the purchase of&para;<br>health insurance) is subject to regulation under the Commerce Clause. Failure to act does result in an effect&para;<br>on commerce, and hence might be said to come under&para;<br>this Court’s “affecting commerce” criterion of Commerce&para;<br>Clause jurisprudence. But in none of its decisions has this&para;<br>Court extended the Clause that far. The second question&para;<br>is whether the congressional power to tax and spend,&para;<br>U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1, permits the conditioning of&para;<br>a State’s continued receipt of all funds under a massive&para;<br>state-administered federal welfare program upon its acceptance of an expansion to that program. Several of our&para;<br>opinions have suggested that the power to tax and spend&para;<br>cannot be used to coerce state administration of a federal&para;<br>program, but we have never found a law enacted under&para;<br>the spending power to be coercive. Those questions are&para;<br>difficult.&para;<br>The case is easy and straightforward, however, in another respect. What is absolutely clear, affirmed by the&para;<br>text of the 1789 Constitution, by the Tenth Amendment&para;<br>ratified in 1791, and by innumerable cases of ours in the&para;<br>220 years since, is that there are structural limits upon&para;<br>federal power—upon what it can prescribe with respect to&para;<br>private conduct, and upon what it can impose upon the&para;<br>sovereign States. Whatever may be the conceptual limits&para;<br>upon the Commerce Clause and upon the power to tax&para;<br>and spend, they cannot be such as will enable the Federal&para;<br>Government to regulate all private conduct and to compel the States to function as administrators of federal&para;<br>programs.&para;<br>That clear principle carries the day here. The striking&para;<br>case of Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942), which&para;<br>held that the economic activity of growing wheat, even&para;<br>for one’s own consumption, affected commerce sufficiently&para;<br>that it could be regulated, always has been regarded as&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the ne plus ultra of expansive Commerce Clause jurisprudence. To go beyond that, and to say the failure to grow&para;<br>wheat (which is not an economic activity, or any activity&para;<br>at all) nonetheless affects commerce and therefore can be&para;<br>federally regulated, is to make mere breathing in and out&para;<br>the basis for federal prescription and to extend federal&para;<br>power to virtually all human activity.&para;<br>As for the constitutional power to tax and spend for&para;<br>the general welfare: The Court has long since expanded&para;<br>that beyond (what Madison thought it meant) taxing and&para;<br>spending for those aspects of the general welfare that were&para;<br>within the Federal Government’s enumerated powers,&para;<br>see United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 65–66 (1936).&para;<br>Thus, we now have sizable federal Departments devoted&para;<br>to subjects not mentioned among Congress’ enumerated&para;<br>powers, and only marginally related to commerce: the Department of Education, the Department of Health and&para;<br>Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban&para;<br>Development. The principal practical obstacle that prevents Congress from using the tax-and-spend power to&para;<br>assume all the general-welfare responsibilities traditionally exercised by the States is the sheer impossibility of&para;<br>managing a Federal Government large enough to administer such a system. That obstacle can be overcome by&para;<br>granting funds to the States, allowing them to administer&para;<br>the program. That is fair and constitutional enough when&para;<br>the States freely agree to have their powers employed and&para;<br>their employees enlisted in the federal scheme. But it is a&para;<br>blatant violation of the constitutional structure when the&para;<br>States have no choice.&para;<br>The Act before us here exceeds federal power both in&para;<br>mandating the purchase of health insurance and in denying nonconsenting States all Medicaid funding. These&para;<br>parts of the Act are central to its design and operation,&para;<br>and all the Act’s other provisions would not have been&para;<br>enacted without them. In our view it must follow that the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>entire statute is inoperative.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Individual Mandate&para;<br>Article I, §8, of the Constitution gives Congress the&para;<br>power to “regulate Commerce . . . among the several&para;<br>States.” The Individual Mandate in the Act commands&para;<br>that every “applicable individual shall for each month&para;<br>beginning after 2013 ensure that the individual, and any&para;<br>dependent of the individual who is an applicable individual, is covered under minimum essential coverage.” 26&para;<br>U. S. C. §5000A(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). If this provision&para;<br>“regulates” anything, it is the failure to maintain minimum essential coverage. One might argue that it regulates that failure by requiring it to be accompanied by&para;<br>payment of a penalty. But that failure—that abstention&para;<br>from commerce—is not “Commerce.” To be sure, purchasing insurance is ”Commerce”; but one does not regulate&para;<br>commerce that does not exist by compelling its existence.&para;<br>In Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196 (1824), Chief&para;<br>Justice Marshall wrote that the power to regulate commerce is the power “to prescribe the rule by which&para;<br>commerce is to be governed.” That understanding is consistent with the original meaning of “regulate” at the time&para;<br>of the Constitution’s ratification, when “to regulate” meant&para;<br>“[t]o adjust by rule, method or established mode,” 2 N.&para;<br>Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828); “[t]o adjust by rule or method,” 2 S.

There is no instance in which this Court or Congress (or anyone else, to our knowledge) has used “regulate”&para;<br>in that peculiar fashion. If the word bore that meaning,&para;<br>Congress’ authority “[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces,” U. S.&para;<br>Const., Art.

But when Congress provides that&para;<br>(nearly) all citizens must buy an insurance contract, it&para;<br>goes beyond “adjust[ing] by rule or method,” Johnson,&para;<br>supra, or “direct[ing] according to rule,” Ash, supra; it&para;<br>directs the creation of commerce.&para;<br>In response, the Government offers two theories as to&para;<br>why the Individual Mandate is nevertheless constitutional. Neither theory suffices to sustain its validity.&para;<br>A&para;<br>First, the Government submits that §5000A is “integral&para;<br>to the Affordable Care Act’s insurance reforms” and “necessary to make effective the Act’s core reforms.” Brief&para;<br>for Petitioners in No. 11–398 (Minimum Coverage Provision) 24 (hereinafter Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage Brief).&para;<br>Congress included a “finding” to similar effect in the Act&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The most authoritative legal dictionaries of the founding era lack&para;<br>any definition for “regulate” or “regulation,” suggesting that the term&para;<br>bears its ordinary meaning (rather than some specialized legal meaning) in the constitutional text.

C. §18091(2)(H).&para;<br>As discussed in more detail in Part V, infra, the Act&para;<br>contains numerous health insurance reforms, but most&para;<br>notable for present purposes are the “guaranteed issue”&para;<br>and “community rating” provisions, §§300gg to 300gg–4.&para;<br>The former provides that, with a few exceptions, “each&para;<br>health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the individual or group market in a State must&para;<br>accept every employer and individual in the State that&para;<br>applies for such coverage.” §300gg–1(a). That is, an insurer may not deny coverage on the basis of, among other&para;<br>things, any pre-existing medical condition that the applicant may have, and the resulting insurance must cover&para;<br>that condition. See §300gg–3.&para;<br>Under ordinary circumstances, of course, insurers would&para;<br>respond by charging high premiums to individuals with&para;<br>pre-existing conditions. The Act seeks to prevent this&para;<br>through the community-rating provision. Simply put, the&para;<br>community-rating provision requires insurers to calculate&para;<br>an individual’s insurance premium based on only four&para;<br>factors: (i) whether the individual’s plan covers just&para;<br>the individual or his family also, (ii) the “rating area” in&para;<br>which the individual lives, (iii) the individual’s age, and&para;<br>(iv) whether the individual uses tobacco. §300gg(a)(1)(A).&para;<br>Aside from the rough proxies of age and tobacco use (and&para;<br>possibly rating area), the Act does not allow an insurer to&para;<br>factor the individual’s health characteristics into the price&para;<br>of his insurance premium. This creates a new incentive&para;<br>for young and healthy individuals without pre-existing&para;<br>conditions. The insurance premiums for those in this&para;<br>group will not reflect their own low actuarial risks but will&para;<br>subsidize insurance for others in the pool. Many of them&para;<br>may decide that purchasing health insurance is not an economically sound decision—especially since the guaranteedissue provision will enable them to purchase it at the&para;<br>same cost in later years and even if they have developed a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

But without the contribution of&para;<br>above-risk premiums from the young and healthy, the&para;<br>community-rating provision will not enable insurers to&para;<br>take on high-risk individuals without a massive increase&para;<br>in premiums.&para;<br>The Government presents the Individual Mandate as a&para;<br>unique feature of a complicated regulatory scheme governing many parties with countervailing incentives that must&para;<br>be carefully balanced. Congress has imposed an extensive&para;<br>set of regulations on the health insurance industry, and&para;<br>compliance with those regulations will likely cost the industry a great deal. If the industry does not respond by&para;<br>increasing premiums, it is not likely to survive. And if&para;<br>the industry does increase premiums, then there is a serious risk that its products—insurance plans—will become&para;<br>economically undesirable for many and prohibitively expensive for the rest.&para;<br>This is not a dilemma unique to regulation of the healthinsurance industry.&para;<br>Government regulation typically&para;<br>imposes costs on the regulated industry—especially regulation that prohibits economic behavior in which most&para;<br>market participants are already engaging, such as “piecing out” the market by selling the product to different&para;<br>classes of people at different prices (in the present context,&para;<br>providing much lower insurance rates to young and&para;<br>healthy buyers). And many industries so regulated face&para;<br>the reality that, without an artificial increase in demand,&para;<br>they cannot continue on. When Congress is regulating&para;<br>these industries directly, it enjoys the broad power to&para;<br>enact “ ‘all appropriate legislation’ ” to “ ‘protec[t]’ ” and&para;<br>“ ‘advanc[e]’ ” commerce, NLRB v.

Congress’ desire to&para;<br>force these individuals to purchase insurance is motivated&para;<br>by the fact that they are further removed from the market&para;<br>than unhealthy individuals with pre-existing conditions,&para;<br>because they are less likely to need extensive care in&para;<br>the near future.

And&para;<br>the last two of these cases show that the scope of the&para;<br>Necessary and Proper Clause is exceeded not only when&para;<br>the congressional action directly violates the sovereignty&para;<br>of the States but also when it violates the background&para;<br>principle of enumerated (and hence limited) federal power.&para;<br>The case upon which the Government principally relies&para;<br>to sustain the Individual Mandate under the Necessary&para;<br>and Proper Clause is Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1 (2005).&para;<br>That case held that Congress could, in an effort to restrain&para;<br>the interstate market in marijuana, ban the local cultivation and possession of that drug. Id., at 15–22. Raich&para;<br>is no precedent for what Congress has done here. That&para;<br>case’s prohibition of growing (cf. Wickard, 317 U. S. 111),&para;<br>and of possession (cf. innumerable federal statutes) did not&para;<br>represent the expansion of the federal power to direct into&para;<br>a broad new field. The mandating of economic activity&para;<br>does, and since it is a field so limitless that it converts the&para;<br>Commerce Clause into a general authority to direct the&para;<br>economy, that mandating is not “consist[ent] with the&para;<br>letter and spirit of the constitution.” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819).&para;<br>Moreover, Raich is far different from the Individual&para;<br>Mandate in another respect.

It is true enough that&para;<br>everyone consumes “health care,” if the term is taken to&para;<br>include the purchase of a bottle of aspirin.

And one is not now purchasing&para;<br>the health care covered by the insurance mandate simply&para;<br>because one is likely to be purchasing it in the future. Our&para;<br>test’s premise of regulated activity is not invented out of&para;<br>whole cloth, but rests upon the Constitution’s requirement&para;<br>that it be commerce which is regulated.

Those differences make a very good argument&para;<br>by the dissent’s own lights, since they show that the failure to purchase health insurance, unlike the failure to&para;<br>purchase cars or broccoli, creates a national, social-welfare&para;<br>problem that is (in the dissent’s view) included among the&para;<br>unenumerated “problems” that the Constitution authorizes the Federal Government to solve. But those differences&para;<br>do not show that the failure to enter the health-insurance&para;<br>market, unlike the failure to buy cars and broccoli, is&para;<br>an activity that Congress can “regulate.” (Of course one&para;<br>day the failure of some of the public to purchase American cars may endanger the existence of domestic automobile manufacturers; or the failure of some to eat broccoli&para;<br>may be found to deprive them of a newly discovered cancerfighting chemical which only that food contains, producing&para;<br>health-care costs that are a burden on the rest of us—in&para;<br>which case, under the theory of JUSTICE GINSBURG’s dissent, moving against those inactivities will also come&para;<br>within the Federal Government’s unenumerated problemsolving powers.)&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Taxing Power&para;<br>As far as §5000A is concerned, we would stop there.&para;<br>Congress has attempted to regulate beyond the scope of its&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

The phrase “independently authorized”&para;<br>suggests the existence of a creature never hitherto seen&para;<br>in the United States Reports: A penalty for constitutional&para;<br>purposes that is also a tax for constitutional purposes. In&para;<br>all our cases the two are mutually exclusive. The provision challenged under the Constitution is either a penalty&para;<br>or else a tax. Of course in many cases what was a regulatory mandate enforced by a penalty could have been&para;<br>imposed as a tax upon permissible action; or what was imposed as a tax upon permissible action could have been a&para;<br>regulatory mandate enforced by a penalty. But we know&para;<br>of no case, and the Government cites none, in which the&para;<br>imposition was, for constitutional purposes, both.5 The&para;<br>two are mutually exclusive. Thus, what the Government’s&para;<br>caption should have read was “ALTERNATIVELY, THE&para;<br>MINIMUM COVERAGE PROVISION IS NOT A MANDATE-WITHPENALTY BUT A TAX.” It is important to bear this in mind&para;<br>in evaluating the tax argument of the Government and of&para;<br>those who support it: The issue is not whether Congress&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 No&para;<br>&para;<br>one seriously contends that any of Congress’ other enumerated&para;<br>powers gives it the authority to enact §5000A as a regulation.&para;<br>5 Of course it can be both for statutory purposes, since Congress can&para;<br>define “tax” and “penalty” in its enactments any way it wishes. That is&para;<br>why United States v. Sotelo, 436 U. S. 268 (1978), does not disprove our&para;<br>statement. That case held that a “penalty” for willful failure to pay&para;<br>one’s taxes was included among the “taxes” made non-dischargeable&para;<br>under the Bankruptcy Code. 436 U. S., at 273–275. Whether the&para;<br>“penalty” was a “tax” within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code had&para;<br>absolutely no bearing on whether it escaped the constitutional limitations on penalties.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

But we&para;<br>cannot rewrite the statute to be what it is not. “ ‘ “[A]lthough this Court will often strain to construe legislation so as to save it against constitutional attack, it&para;<br>must not and will not carry this to the point of perverting&para;<br>the purpose of a statute . . .” or judicially rewriting it.’ ”&para;<br>Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v.

In this case, there is&para;<br>simply no way, “without doing violence to the fair meaning&para;<br>of the words used,” Grenada County Supervisors v. Brogden, 112 U.

Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U. S. 20, 38&para;<br>(1922).&para;<br>So the question is, quite simply, whether the exaction&para;<br>here is imposed for violation of the law. It unquestionably is. The minimum-coverage provision is found in 26&para;<br>U. S. C. §5000A, entitled “Requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.” (Emphasis added.) It commands&para;<br>that every “applicable individual shall . . . ensure that the&para;<br>individual . . . is covered under minimum essential coverage.” Ibid. (emphasis added). And the immediately following provision states that, “[i]f . . . an applicable&para;<br>individual . . . fails to meet the requirement of subsection&para;<br>(a) . . . there is hereby imposed . . . a penalty.” §5000A(b)&para;<br>(emphasis added). And several of Congress’ legislative&para;<br>“findings” with regard to §5000A confirm that it sets forth&para;<br>a legal requirement and constitutes the assertion of regulatory power, not mere taxing power. See 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§18091(2)(A) (“The requirement regulates activity . . .”);&para;<br>§18091(2)(C) (“The requirement . . . will add millions of&para;<br>new consumers to the health insurance market . . .”);&para;<br>§18091(2)(D) (“The requirement achieves near-universal&para;<br>coverage”); §18091(2)(H) (“The requirement is an essential&para;<br>part of this larger regulation of economic activity, and the&para;<br>absence of the requirement would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance market”); §18091(3) (“[T]he&para;<br>Supreme Court of the United States ruled that insurance&para;<br>is interstate commerce subject to Federal regulation”).&para;<br>The Government and those who support its view on the&para;<br>tax point rely on New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144,&para;<br>to justify reading “shall” to mean “may.” The “shall” in&para;<br>that case was contained in an introductory provision—a&para;<br>recital that provided for no legal consequences—which&para;<br>said that “[e]ach State shall be responsible for providing&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

C. §2021c(a)(1)(A). The Court did not hold that&para;<br>“shall” could be construed to mean “may,” but rather that&para;<br>this preliminary provision could not impose upon the operative provisions of the Act a mandate that they did not&para;<br>contain: “We . . . decline petitioners’ invitation to construe §2021c(a)(1)(A), alone and in isolation, as a command to the States independent of the remainder of the&para;<br>Act.” New York, 505 U. S., at 170. Our opinion then&para;<br>proceeded to “consider each [of the three operative provisions] in turn.” Ibid. Here the mandate—the “shall”—is&para;<br>contained not in an inoperative preliminary recital, but in&para;<br>the dispositive operative provision itself. New York provides no support for reading it to be permissive.&para;<br>Quite separately, the fact that Congress (in its own&para;<br>words) “imposed . . . a penalty,” 26 U. S. C. §5000A(b)(1),&para;<br>for failure to buy insurance is alone sufficient to render&para;<br>that failure unlawful. It is one of the canons of interpretation that a statute that penalizes an act makes it unlawful: “[W]here the statute inflicts a penalty for doing an act,&para;<br>although the act itself is not expressly prohibited, yet to do&para;<br>the act is unlawful, because it cannot be supposed that the&para;<br>Legislature intended that a penalty should be inflicted for&para;<br>a lawful act.” Powhatan Steamboat Co. v. Appomattox R.&para;<br>Co., 24 How. 247, 252 (1861).

Kent, Commentaries on American Law 436 (1826).&para;<br>We never have classified as a tax an exaction imposed&para;<br>for violation of the law, and so too, we never have classified as a tax an exaction described in the legislation itself&para;<br>as a penalty. To be sure, we have sometimes treated as a&para;<br>tax a statutory exaction (imposed for something other&para;<br>than a violation of law) which bore an agnostic label that&para;<br>does not entail the significant constitutional consequences&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

United States,&para;<br>supra.). But we have never—never—treated as a tax an&para;<br>exaction which faces up to the critical difference between&para;<br>a tax and a penalty, and explicitly denominates the exaction a “penalty.” Eighteen times in §5000A itself and elsewhere throughout the Act, Congress called the exaction in&para;<br>§5000A(b) a “penalty.”&para;<br>That §5000A imposes not a simple tax but a mandate to&para;<br>which a penalty is attached is demonstrated by the fact&para;<br>that some are exempt from the tax who are not exempt from the mandate—a distinction that would make&para;<br>no sense if the mandate were not a mandate. Section&para;<br>5000A(d) exempts three classes of people from the definition of “applicable individual” subject to the minimum&para;<br>coverage requirement: Those with religious objections or&para;<br>who participate in a “health care sharing ministry,”&para;<br>§5000A(d)(2); those who are “not lawfully present” in the&para;<br>United States, §5000A(d)(3); and those who are incarcerated, §5000A(d)(4). Section 5000A(e) then creates a separate set of exemptions, excusing from liability for the&para;<br>penalty certain individuals who are subject to the minimum coverage requirement: Those who cannot afford&para;<br>coverage, §5000A(e)(1); who earn too little income to require filing a tax return, §5000A(e)(2); who are members&para;<br>of an Indian tribe, §5000A(e)(3); who experience only short&para;<br>gaps in coverage, §5000A(e)(4); and who, in the judgment&para;<br>of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, “have&para;<br>suffered a hardship with respect to the capability to obtain&para;<br>coverage,” §5000A(e)(5). If §5000A were a tax, these two&para;<br>classes of exemption would make no sense; there being no&para;<br>requirement, all the exemptions would attach to the penalty (renamed tax) alone.&para;<br>In the face of all these indications of a regulatory requirement accompanied by a penalty, the Solicitor General&para;<br>assures us that “neither the Treasury Department nor the&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

It&para;<br>notes that “[t]he minimum coverage provision amends the&para;<br>Internal Revenue Code to provide that a non-exempted&para;<br>individual . . . will owe a monetary penalty, in addition to&para;<br>the income tax itself,” and that “[t]he [Internal Revenue&para;<br>Service (IRS)] will assess and collect the penalty in the&para;<br>same manner as assessable penalties under the Internal&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

See also Lipke v. Lederer,&para;<br>259 U. S. 557 (1922) (same). Moreover, while the penalty&para;<br>is assessed and collected by the IRS, §5000A is administered both by that agency and by the Department of&para;<br>Health and Human Services (and also the Secretary of&para;<br>Veteran Affairs), see §5000A(e)(1)(D), (e)(5), (f)(1)(A)(v),&para;<br>(f)(1)(E) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), which is responsible for&para;<br>defining its substantive scope—a feature that would be&para;<br>quite extraordinary for taxes.&para;<br>The Government points out that “[t]he amount of the&para;<br>penalty will be calculated as a percentage of household&para;<br>income for federal income tax purposes, subject to a floor&para;<br>and [a] ca[p],” and that individuals who earn so little&para;<br>money that they “are not required to file income tax returns for the taxable year are not subject to the penalty”&para;<br>(though they are, as we discussed earlier, subject to the&para;<br>mandate).

C. §2716a(a).&para;<br>The last of the feeble arguments in favor of petitioners that we will address is the contention that what this&para;<br>statute repeatedly calls a penalty is in fact a tax because it&para;<br>contains no scienter requirement. The presence of such a&para;<br>requirement suggests a penalty—though one can imagine&para;<br>a tax imposed only on willful action; but the absence of&para;<br>such a requirement does not suggest a tax. Penalties for&para;<br>absolute-liability offenses are commonplace. And where a&para;<br>statute is silent as to scienter, we traditionally presume&para;<br>a mens rea requirement if the statute imposes a “severe&para;<br>penalty.” Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 618&para;<br>(1994). Since we have an entire jurisprudence addressing&para;<br>when it is that a scienter requirement should be inferred&para;<br>from a penalty, it is quite illogical to suggest that a&para;<br>penalty is not a penalty for want of an express scienter&para;<br>requirement.&para;<br>And the nail in the coffin is that the mandate and penalty are located in Title I of the Act, its operative core,&para;<br>rather than where a tax would be found—in Title IX,&para;<br>containing the Act’s “Revenue Provisions.” In sum, “the&para;<br>terms of [the] act rende[r] it unavoidable,” Parsons v.&para;<br>Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 448 (1830), that Congress imposed a&para;<br>regulatory penalty, not a tax.&para;<br>For all these reasons, to say that the Individual Mandate merely imposes a tax is not to interpret the statute&para;<br>but to rewrite it. Judicial tax-writing is particularly troubling. Taxes have never been popular, see, e.g., Stamp Act&para;<br>of 1765, and in part for that reason, the Constitution&para;<br>requires tax increases to originate in the House of Representatives. See Art. I, §7, cl. 1. That is to say, they must&para;<br>originate in the legislative body most accountable to the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012) &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>people, where legislators must weigh the need for the tax&para;<br>against the terrible price they might pay at their next&para;<br>election, which is never more than two years off. The&para;<br>Federalist No. 58 “defend[ed] the decision to give the&para;<br>origination power to the House on the ground that the&para;<br>Chamber that is more accountable to the people should&para;<br>have the primary role in raising revenue.” United States&para;<br>v. Munoz-Flores, 495 U. S. 385, 395 (1990). We have no&para;<br>doubt that Congress knew precisely what it was doing&para;<br>when it rejected an earlier version of this legislation that&para;<br>imposed a tax instead of a requirement-with-penalty. See&para;<br>Affordable Health Care for America Act, H. R. 3962, 111th&para;<br>Cong., 1st Sess., §501 (2009); America’s Healthy Future&para;<br>Act of 2009, S. 1796, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., §1301. Imposing a tax through judicial legislation inverts the constitutional scheme, and places the power to tax in the branch of&para;<br>government least accountable to the citizenry.&para;<br>Finally, we must observe that rewriting §5000A as a tax&para;<br>in order to sustain its constitutionality would force us to&para;<br>confront a difficult constitutional question: whether this is&para;<br>a direct tax that must be apportioned among the States&para;<br>according to their population. Art. I, §9, cl. 4. Perhaps it&para;<br>is not (we have no need to address the point); but the&para;<br>meaning of the Direct Tax Clause is famously unclear, and&para;<br>its application here is a question of first impression that&para;<br>deserves more thoughtful consideration than the lick-anda-promise accorded by the Government and its supporters.&para;<br>The Government’s opening brief did not even address the&para;<br>question—perhaps because, until today, no federal court&para;<br>has accepted the implausible argument that §5000A is&para;<br>an exercise of the tax power.

S. C. §7421(a) (2006 ed.).&para;<br>We have left the question to this point because it&para;<br>seemed to us that the dispositive question whether the&para;<br>minimum-coverage provision is a tax is more appropriately&para;<br>addressed in the significant constitutional context of&para;<br>whether it is an exercise of Congress’ taxing power. Having found that it is not, we have no difficulty in deciding&para;<br>that these suits do not have “the purpose of restraining&para;<br>the assessment or collection of any tax.”6&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The amicus appointed to defend the proposition that the AntiInjunction Act deprives us of jurisdiction stresses that the penalty for&para;<br>failing to comply with the mandate “shall be assessed and collected&para;<br>in the same manner as an assessable penalty under subchapter B of&para;<br>chapter 68,” 26 U. S. C. §5000A(g)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), and that&para;<br>such penalties “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner&para;<br>as taxes,” §6671(a) (2006 ed.). But that point seems to us to confirm&para;<br>the inapplicability of the Anti-Injunction Act. That the penalty is to&para;<br>be “assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes” refutes the&para;<br>proposition that it is a tax for all statutory purposes, including with&para;<br>respect to the Anti-Injunction Act. Moreover, elsewhere in the Internal&para;<br>Revenue Code, Congress has provided both that a particular payment&para;<br>shall be “assessed and collected” in the same manner as a tax and that&para;<br>no suit shall be maintained to restrain the assessment or collection of&para;<br>the payment. See, e.g., §§7421(b)(1), §6901(a); §6305(a), (b). The&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

The rhetorical device that&para;<br>tries to cloak this argument in superficial plausibility is&para;<br>the same device employed in arguing that for constitutional purposes the minimum-coverage provision is a tax:&para;<br>confusing the question of what Congress did with the&para;<br>question of what Congress could have done. What qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, unlike&para;<br>what qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Constitution, is&para;<br>entirely within the control of Congress. Compare Bailey v.&para;<br>George, 259 U. S. 16, 20 (1922) (Anti-Injunction Act barred&para;<br>suit to restrain collections under the Child Labor Tax&para;<br>Law), with Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U. S., at 36–41&para;<br>(holding the same law unconstitutional as exceeding Congress’ taxing power). Congress could have defined “tax”&para;<br>for purposes of that statute in such fashion as to exclude&para;<br>some exactions that in fact are “taxes.” It might have&para;<br>prescribed, for example, that a particular exercise of the&para;<br>taxing power “shall not be regarded as a tax for purposes&para;<br>of the Anti-Injunction Act.” But there is no such prescription here. What the Government would have us believe in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>latter directive would be superfluous if the former invoked the AntiInjunction Act.&para;<br>Amicus also suggests that the penalty should be treated as a tax&para;<br>because it is an assessable penalty, and the Code’s assessment provision authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to assess “all taxes (including interest, additional amounts, additions to the tax, and assessable penalties) imposed by this title.” §6201(a) (2006 ed., Supp.&para;<br>IV). But the fact that such items are included as “taxes” for purposes of&para;<br>assessment does not establish that they are included as “taxes” for&para;<br>purposes of other sections of the Code, such as the Anti-Injunction Act,&para;<br>that do not contain similar “including” language.&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

That carries verbal wizardry too far, deep into the forbidden land of the&para;<br>sophists.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The Medicaid Expansion&para;<br>We now consider respondents’ second challenge to the&para;<br>constitutionality of the ACA, namely, that the Act’s dramatic expansion of the Medicaid program exceeds Congress’ power to attach conditions to federal grants to the&para;<br>States.&para;<br>The ACA does not legally compel the States to participate in the expanded Medicaid program, but the Act authorizes a severe sanction for any State that refuses to go&para;<br>along: termination of all the State’s Medicaid funding. For&para;<br>the average State, the annual federal Medicaid subsidy is&para;<br>equal to more than one-fifth of the State’s expenditures.7&para;<br>A State forced out of the program would not only lose this&para;<br>huge sum but would almost certainly find it necessary to&para;<br>increase its own health-care expenditures substantially,&para;<br>requiring either a drastic reduction in funding for other&para;<br>programs or a large increase in state taxes. And these&para;<br>new taxes would come on top of the federal taxes already&para;<br>paid by the State’s citizens to fund the Medicaid program&para;<br>in other States.&para;<br>The States challenging the constitutionality of the ACA’s&para;<br>Medicaid Expansion contend that, for these practical&para;<br>reasons, the Act really does not give them any choice at&para;<br>all. As proof of this, they point to the goal and the struc——————&para;<br>7 “State expenditures” is used here to mean annual expenditures from&para;<br>the States’ own funding sources, and it excludes federal grants unless&para;<br>otherwise noted.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

The goal of the Act is to provide nearuniversal medical coverage, 42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(D), and&para;<br>without 100% State participation in the Medicaid program, attainment of this goal would be thwarted. Even if&para;<br>States could elect to remain in the old Medicaid program,&para;<br>while declining to participate in the Expansion, there&para;<br>would be a gaping hole in coverage. And if a substantial&para;<br>number of States were entirely expelled from the program,&para;<br>the number of persons without coverage would be even&para;<br>higher.&para;<br>In light of the ACA’s goal of near-universal coverage,&para;<br>petitioners argue, if Congress had thought that anything&para;<br>less than 100% state participation was a realistic possibility, Congress would have provided a backup scheme. But&para;<br>no such scheme is to be found anywhere in the more than&para;<br>900 pages of the Act. This shows, they maintain, that&para;<br>Congress was certain that the ACA’s Medicaid offer was&para;<br>one that no State could refuse.&para;<br>In response to this argument, the Government contends&para;<br>that any congressional assumption about uniform state&para;<br>participation was based on the simple fact that the offer&para;<br>of federal funds associated with the expanded coverage is&para;<br>such a generous gift that no State would want to turn it&para;<br>down.&para;<br>To evaluate these arguments, we consider the extent of&para;<br>the Federal Government’s power to spend money and to&para;<br>attach conditions to money granted to the States.&para;<br>A&para;<br>No one has ever doubted that the Constitution authorizes the Federal Government to spend money, but for&para;<br>many years the scope of this power was unsettled. The&para;<br>Constitution grants Congress the power to collect taxes “to&para;<br>. . . provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United&para;<br>States,” Art.

And just as a contract&para;<br>is voidable if coerced, “[t]he legitimacy of Congress’ power&para;<br>to legislate under the spending power . . . rests on whether&para;<br>the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms&para;<br>of the ‘contract.’ ” Ibid.

They note that Congress, instead of&para;<br>expanding Medicaid, could have established an entirely&para;<br>federal program to provide coverage for the same group of&para;<br>people. By choosing to structure Medicaid as a cooperative&para;<br>federal-state program, they contend, Congress allows for&para;<br>more state control. Ibid.&para;<br>This argument reflects a view of federalism that our&para;<br>cases have rejected—and with good reason. When Congress compels the States to do its bidding, it blurs the&para;<br>lines of political accountability. If the Federal Government makes a controversial decision while acting on its&para;<br>own, “it is the Federal Government that makes the decision in full view of the public, and it will be federal officials that suffer the consequences if the decision turns out&para;<br>to be detrimental or unpopular.” New York, 505 U.

But when the Federal Government compels the&para;<br>States to take unpopular actions, “it may be state officials&para;<br>who will bear the brunt of public disapproval, while the&para;<br>federal officials who devised the regulatory program may&para;<br>remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of their&para;<br>decision.” Id., at 169; see Printz, supra, at 930. For this&para;<br>reason, federal officeholders may view this “departur[e]&para;<br>from the federal structure to be in their personal interests&para;<br>. . . as a means of shifting responsibility for the eventual&para;<br>decision.” New York, 505 U. S., at 182–183. And even state&para;<br>officials may favor such a “departure from the constitutional plan,” since uncertainty concerning responsibility&para;<br>may also permit them to escape accountability. Id., at&para;<br>182. If a program is popular, state officials may claim&para;<br>credit; if it is unpopular, they may protest that they were&para;<br>merely responding to a federal directive.&para;<br>Once it is recognized that spending-power legislation&para;<br>cannot coerce state participation, two questions remain:&para;<br>(1) What is the meaning of coercion in this context? (2) Is&para;<br>the ACA’s expanded Medicaid coverage coercive? We now&para;<br>turn to those questions.&para;<br>D&para;<br>1&para;<br>The answer to the first of these questions—the meaning&para;<br>of coercion in the present context—is straightforward. As&para;<br>we have explained, the legitimacy of attaching conditions&para;<br>to federal grants to the States depends on the voluntariness of the States’ choice to accept or decline the offered&para;<br>package. Therefore, if States really have no choice other&para;<br>than to accept the package, the offer is coercive, and the&para;<br>conditions cannot be sustained under the spending power.&para;<br>And as our decision in South Dakota v. Dole makes clear,&para;<br>theoretical voluntariness is not enough.&para;<br>In South Dakota v. Dole, we considered whether the&para;<br>spending power permitted Congress to condition 5% of the&para;<br>&para;<br>36&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

South Dakota argued that the program was impermissibly coercive, but we&para;<br>disagreed, reasoning that “Congress ha[d] directed only&para;<br>that a State desiring to establish a minimum drinking age&para;<br>lower than 21 lose a relatively small percentage of certain&para;<br>federal highway funds.” 483 U. S., at 211. Because “all&para;<br>South Dakota would lose if she adhere[d] to her chosen&para;<br>course as to a suitable minimum drinking age [was] 5%&para;<br>of the funds otherwise obtainable under specified highway grant programs,” we found that “Congress ha[d] offered relatively mild encouragement to the States to enact&para;<br>higher minimum drinking ages than they would otherwise&para;<br>choose.” Ibid. Thus, the decision whether to comply with&para;<br>the federal condition “remain[ed] the prerogative of the&para;<br>States not merely in theory but in fact,” and so the program at issue did not exceed Congress’ power. Id., at 211–&para;<br>212 (emphasis added).&para;<br>The question whether a law enacted under the spending&para;<br>power is coercive in fact will sometimes be difficult, but&para;<br>where Congress has plainly “crossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion,” New York, supra, at&para;<br>175, a federal program that coopts the States’ political&para;<br>processes must be declared unconstitutional. “[T]he federal balance is too essential a part of our constitutional&para;<br>structure and plays too vital a role in securing freedom for&para;<br>us to admit inability to intervene.” Lopez, 514 U. S., at&para;<br>578 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).&para;<br>2&para;<br>The Federal Government’s argument in this case at best&para;<br>pays lip service to the anticoercion principle. The Federal&para;<br>Government suggests that it is sufficient if States are&para;<br>“free, as a matter of law, to turn down” federal funds.&para;<br>Brief for Respondents in No. 11–400, p. 17 (emphasis&para;<br>added); see also id., at 25. According to the Federal Gov-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>37&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ernment, neither the amount of the offered federal funds&para;<br>nor the amount of the federal taxes extracted from the&para;<br>taxpayers of a State to pay for the program in question is&para;<br>relevant in determining whether there is impermissible&para;<br>coercion. Id., at 41–46.&para;<br>This argument ignores reality. When a heavy federal&para;<br>tax is levied to support a federal program that offers large&para;<br>grants to the States, States may, as a practical matter, be&para;<br>unable to refuse to participate in the federal program and&para;<br>to substitute a state alternative. Even if a State believes&para;<br>that the federal program is ineffective and inefficient,&para;<br>withdrawal would likely force the State to impose a huge&para;<br>tax increase on its residents, and this new state tax would&para;<br>come on top of the federal taxes already paid by residents&para;<br>to support subsidies to participating States.13&para;<br>Acceptance of the Federal Government’s interpretation of the anticoercion rule would permit Congress to dictate policy in areas traditionally governed primarily at the&para;<br>state or local level. Suppose, for example, that Congress&para;<br>enacted legislation offering each State a grant equal to the&para;<br>State’s entire annual expenditures for primary and secondary education. Suppose also that this funding came&para;<br>with conditions governing such things as school curriculum, the hiring and tenure of teachers, the drawing of&para;<br>school districts, the length and hours of the school day, the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 JUSTICE GINSBURG argues that “[a] State . . . has no claim on the&para;<br>money its residents pay in federal taxes.” Ante, at 59, n. 26. This is&para;<br>true as a formal matter. “When the United States Government taxes&para;<br>United States citizens, it taxes them ‘in their individual capacities’ as&para;<br>‘the people of America’—not as residents of a particular State.” Ante, at&para;<br>58, n. 26 (quoting U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779,&para;<br>839 (1995) (KENNEDY, J., concurring)). But unless JUSTICE GINSBURG&para;<br>thinks that there is no limit to the amount of money that can be&para;<br>squeezed out of taxpayers, heavy federal taxation diminishes the&para;<br>practical ability of States to collect their own taxes.&para;<br>&para;<br>38&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

As a matter of law, a State could turn&para;<br>down that offer, but if it did so, its residents would not&para;<br>only be required to pay the federal taxes needed to support&para;<br>this expensive new program, but they would also be forced&para;<br>to pay an equivalent amount in state taxes. And if the&para;<br>State gave in to the federal law, the State and its subdivisions would surrender their traditional authority in the&para;<br>field of education.

In this case, however, there&para;<br>can be no doubt. In structuring the ACA, Congress unambiguously signaled its belief that every State would have&para;<br>no real choice but to go along with the Medicaid Expansion. If the anticoercion rule does not apply in this case,&para;<br>then there is no such rule.&para;<br>1&para;<br>The dimensions of the Medicaid program lend strong&para;<br>support to the petitioner States’ argument that refusing to&para;<br>accede to the conditions set out in the ACA is not a realistic option.

In that Fiscal Year, total&para;<br>federal outlays for grants to state and local governments amounted to&para;<br>over $608 billion, see Table 12.1, and state and local government&para;<br>expenditures from their own sources amounted to $1.6 trillion, see&para;<br>Table 15.2. Using these numbers, 44.8% of all federal outlays to both&para;<br>state and local governments was allocated to Medicaid, amounting to&para;<br>16.8% of all state and local expenditures from their own sources.&para;<br>&para;<br>40&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>$5 billion, NASBO Report 47. These federal dollars total&para;<br>nearly two thirds—64.6%—of all Medicaid expenditures&para;<br>nationwide.15 Id., at 46.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals concluded that the States failed to&para;<br>establish coercion in this case in part because the “states&para;<br>have the power to tax and raise revenue, and therefore can&para;<br>create and fund programs of their own if they do not like&para;<br>Congress’s terms.” 648 F. 3d 1235, 1268 (CA11 2011); see&para;<br>Brief for Sen. Harry Reid et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11–&para;<br>400, p. 21 (“States may always choose to decrease expenditures on other programs or to raise revenues”). But the&para;<br>sheer size of this federal spending program in relation to&para;<br>state expenditures means that a State would be very hard&para;<br>pressed to compensate for the loss of federal funds by&para;<br>cutting other spending or raising additional revenue.&para;<br>Arizona, for example, commits 12% of its state expenditures to Medicaid, and relies on the Federal Government&para;<br>to provide the rest: $5.6 billion, equaling roughly one-third&para;<br>of Arizona’s annual state expenditures of $17 billion. See&para;<br>NASBO Report 7, 47. Therefore, if Arizona lost federal&para;<br>Medicaid funding, the State would have to commit an&para;<br>additional 33% of all its state expenditures to fund an&para;<br>equivalent state program along the lines of pre-expansion&para;<br>Medicaid. This means that the State would have to allocate 45% of its annual expenditures for that one purpose.&para;<br>See ibid.&para;<br>The States are far less reliant on federal funding for any&para;<br>other program.

See ibid. In Arizona,&para;<br>for example, although federal Medicaid expenditures are&para;<br>equal to 33% of all state expenditures, federal education&para;<br>funds amount to only 9.8% of all state expenditures. See&para;<br>ibid. And even in States with less than average federal&para;<br>Medicaid funding, that funding is at least twice the size of&para;<br>federal education funding as a percentage of state expenditures. Id., at 7, 16, 47.&para;<br>A State forced out of the Medicaid program would face&para;<br>burdens in addition to the loss of federal Medicaid funding. For example, a nonparticipating State might be found&para;<br>to be ineligible for other major federal funding sources,&para;<br>such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF),&para;<br>which is premised on the expectation that States will&para;<br>participate in Medicaid. See 42 U. S. C. §602(a)(3) (2006&para;<br>ed.) (requiring that certain beneficiaries of TANF funds be&para;<br>“eligible for medical assistance under the State[’s Medicaid] plan”). And withdrawal or expulsion from the Medicaid program would not relieve a State’s hospitals of their&para;<br>obligation under federal law to provide care for patients&para;<br>who are unable to pay for medical services. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, §1395dd,&para;<br>requires hospitals that receive any federal funding to&para;<br>provide stabilization care for indigent patients but does&para;<br>not offer federal funding to assist facilities in carrying out&para;<br>its mandate. Many of these patients are now covered by&para;<br>Medicaid. If providers could not look to the Medicaid&para;<br>program to pay for this care, they would find it exceedingly difficult to comply with federal law unless they were&para;<br>given substantial state support. See, e.g., Brief for Economists as Amici Curiae in No 11–400, p. 11.&para;<br>For these reasons, the offer that the ACA makes to the&para;<br>States—go along with a dramatic expansion of Medicaid or&para;<br>&para;<br>42&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

In South Dakota v. Dole, the total amount&para;<br>that the States would have lost if every single State&para;<br>had refused to comply with the 21-year-old drinking&para;<br>age was approximately $614.7 million—or about 0.19%&para;<br>of all state expenditures combined.&para;<br>See Nat. Assn.&para;<br>of State Budget Officers, 1989 (Fiscal Years 1987–&para;<br>1989 Data) State Expenditure Report 10, 84 (1989),&para;<br>http://www.nasbo.org/publications-data/state-expenditurereport/archives. South Dakota stood to lose, at most,&para;<br>funding that amounted to less than 1% of its annual state&para;<br>expenditures. See ibid. Under the ACA, by contrast, the&para;<br>Federal Government has threatened to withhold 42.3% of&para;<br>all federal outlays to the states, or approximately $233&para;<br>billion. See NASBO Report 7, 10, 47. South Dakota&para;<br>stands to lose federal funding equaling 28.9% of its annual&para;<br>state expenditures. See id., at 7, 47. Withholding $614.7&para;<br>million, equaling only 0.19% of all state expenditures&para;<br>combined, is aptly characterized as “relatively mild encouragement,” but threatening to withhold $233 billion,&para;<br>equaling 21.86% of all state expenditures combined, is a&para;<br>different matter.&para;<br>2&para;<br>What the statistics suggest is confirmed by the goal&para;<br>and structure of the ACA. In crafting the ACA, Congress&para;<br>clearly expressed its informed view that no State could&para;<br>possibly refuse the offer that the ACA extends.&para;<br>The stated goal of the ACA is near-universal health care&para;<br>coverage. To achieve this goal, the ACA mandates that&para;<br>every person obtain a minimum level of coverage. It attempts to reach this goal in several different ways. The&para;<br>guaranteed issue and community-rating provisions are&para;<br>designed to make qualifying insurance available and&para;<br>affordable for persons with medical conditions that may&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>43&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>require expensive care. Other ACA provisions seek to&para;<br>make such policies more affordable for people of modest&para;<br>means.&para;<br>Finally, for low-income individuals who are&para;<br>simply not able to obtain insurance, Congress expanded&para;<br>Medicaid, transforming it from a program covering only&para;<br>members of a limited list of vulnerable groups into a program that provides at least the requisite minimum level&para;<br>of coverage for the poor. See 42 U. S. C. §§1396a(a)&para;<br>(10)(A)(i)(VIII) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), 1396u–7(a), (b)(5),&para;<br>18022(a). This design was intended to provide at least&para;<br>a specified minimum level of coverage for all Americans,&para;<br>but the achievement of that goal obviously depends on&para;<br>participation by every single State. If any State—not&para;<br>to mention all of the 26 States that brought this suit—&para;<br>chose to decline the federal offer, there would be a gaping&para;<br>hole in the ACA’s coverage.&para;<br>It is true that some persons who are eligible for Medicaid coverage under the ACA may be able to secure private&para;<br>insurance, either through their employers or by obtaining subsidized insurance through an exchange. See 26&para;<br>U. S. C. §36B(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); Brief for Respondents in No. 11–400, at 12. But the new federal subsidies&para;<br>are not available to those whose income is below the federal poverty level, and the ACA provides no means, other&para;<br>than Medicaid, for these individuals to obtain coverage&para;<br>and comply with the Mandate. The Government counters&para;<br>that these people will not have to pay the penalty, see, e.g.,&para;<br>Tr. of Oral Arg. 68 (Mar. 28, 2012); Brief for Respondents&para;<br>in No. 11–400, at 49–50, but that argument misses the&para;<br>point: Without Medicaid, these individuals will not have&para;<br>coverage and the ACA’s goal of near-universal coverage&para;<br>will be severely frustrated.&para;<br>If Congress had thought that States might actually&para;<br>refuse to go along with the expansion of Medicaid, Congress would surely have devised a backup scheme so that&para;<br>the most vulnerable groups in our society, those previously&para;<br>&para;<br>44&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>eligible for Medicaid, would not be left out in the cold. But&para;<br>nowhere in the over 900-page Act is such a scheme to be&para;<br>found. By contrast, because Congress thought that some&para;<br>States might decline federal funding for the operation of&para;<br>a “health benefit exchange,” Congress provided a backup&para;<br>scheme; if a State declines to participate in the operation&para;<br>of an exchange, the Federal Government will step in&para;<br>and operate an exchange in that State. See 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§18041(c)(1). Likewise, knowing that States would not&para;<br>necessarily provide affordable health insurance for aliens&para;<br>lawfully present in the United States—because Medicaid&para;<br>does not require States to provide such coverage—Congress extended the availability of the new federal insurance subsidies to all aliens. See 26 U. S. C. §36B(c)&para;<br>(1)(B)(ii) (excepting from the income limit individuals&para;<br>who are “not eligible for the medicaid program . . . by&para;<br>reason of [their] alien status”). Congress did not make&para;<br>these subsidies available for citizens with incomes below&para;<br>the poverty level because Congress obviously assumed&para;<br>that they would be covered by Medicaid. If Congress had&para;<br>contemplated that some of these citizens would be left&para;<br>without Medicaid coverage as a result of a State’s withdrawal or expulsion from the program, Congress surely&para;<br>would have made them eligible for the tax subsidies provided for low-income aliens.&para;<br>These features of the ACA convey an unmistakable&para;<br>message: Congress never dreamed that any State would&para;<br>refuse to go along with the expansion of Medicaid. Congress well understood that refusal was not a practical&para;<br>option.&para;<br>The Federal Government does not dispute the inference&para;<br>that Congress anticipated 100% state participation, but it&para;<br>argues that this assumption was based on the fact that&para;<br>ACA’s offer was an “exceedingly generous” gift.

Just as this benefactor&para;<br>might assume that all of these 50 individuals would snap&para;<br>up his offer, so Congress assumed that every State would&para;<br>gratefully accept the federal funds (and conditions) to go&para;<br>with the expansion of Medicaid.&para;<br>This characterization of the ACA’s offer raises obvious&para;<br>questions. If that offer is “exceedingly generous,” as the&para;<br>Federal Government maintains, why have more than half&para;<br>the States brought this lawsuit, contending that the offer&para;<br>is coercive? And why did Congress find it necessary to&para;<br>threaten that any State refusing to accept this “exceedingly generous” gift would risk losing all Medicaid funds?&para;<br>Congress could have made just the new funding provided&para;<br>under the ACA contingent on acceptance of the terms of&para;<br>the Medicaid Expansion. Congress took such an approach&para;<br>in some earlier amendments to Medicaid, separating new&para;<br>coverage requirements and funding from the rest of the&para;<br>program so that only new funding was conditioned on new&para;<br>eligibility extensions. See, e.g., Social Security Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 1465.&para;<br>Congress’ decision to do otherwise here reflects its understanding that the ACA offer is not an “exceedingly&para;<br>generous” gift that no State in its right mind would decline. Instead, acceptance of the offer will impose very&para;<br>substantial costs on participating States. It is true that&para;<br>the Federal Government will bear most of the initial costs&para;<br>associated with the Medicaid Expansion, first paying&para;<br>100% of the costs of covering newly eligible individuals&para;<br>between 2014 and 2016. 42 U. S. C. §1396d(y). But that&para;<br>is just part of the picture. Participating States will be&para;<br>forced to shoulder substantial costs as well, because after&para;<br>2019 the Federal Government will cover only 90% of the&para;<br>costs associated with the Expansion, see ibid., with state&para;<br>spending projected to increase by at least $20 billion by&para;<br>2020 as a consequence.

J., joined by BREYER and KAGAN,&para;<br>JJ.). Because the Medicaid Expansion is unconstitutional,&para;<br>the question of remedy arises. The most natural remedy&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>47&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>would be to invalidate the Medicaid Expansion. However,&para;<br>the Government proposes—in two cursory sentences at&para;<br>the very end of its brief—preserving the Expansion. Under&para;<br>its proposal, States would receive the additional Medicaid funds if they expand eligibility, but States would&para;<br>keep their pre-existing Medicaid funds if they do not&para;<br>expand eligibility. We cannot accept the Government’s&para;<br>suggestion.&para;<br>The reality that States were given no real choice but to&para;<br>expand Medicaid was not an accident. Congress assumed&para;<br>States would have no choice, and the ACA depends on&para;<br>States’ having no choice, because its Mandate requires&para;<br>low-income individuals to obtain insurance many of them&para;<br>can afford only through the Medicaid Expansion. Furthermore, a State’s withdrawal might subject everyone in&para;<br>the State to much higher insurance premiums. That is&para;<br>because the Medicaid Expansion will no longer offset the&para;<br>cost to the insurance industry imposed by the ACA’s insurance regulations and taxes, a point that is explained in&para;<br>more detail in the severability section below. To make the&para;<br>Medicaid Expansion optional despite the ACA’s structure&para;<br>and design “ ‘would be to make a new law, not to enforce&para;<br>an old one. This is no part of our duty.’ ” Trade-Mark&para;<br>Cases, 100 U. S. 82, 99 (1879).&para;<br>Worse, the Government’s proposed remedy introduces a&para;<br>new dynamic: States must choose between expanding&para;<br>Medicaid or paying huge tax sums to the federal fisc for&para;<br>the sole benefit of expanding Medicaid in other States. If&para;<br>this divisive dynamic between and among States can be&para;<br>introduced at all, it should be by conscious congressional&para;<br>choice, not by Court-invented interpretation. We do not&para;<br>doubt that States are capable of making decisions when&para;<br>put in a tight spot. We do doubt the authority of this&para;<br>Court to put them there.&para;<br>The Government cites a severability clause codified with&para;<br>Medicaid in Chapter 7 of the United States Code stating&para;<br>&para;<br>48&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

S. C. §1303 (2006 ed.). But that&para;<br>clause tells us only that other provisions in Chapter 7&para;<br>should not be invalidated if §1396c, the authorization for&para;<br>the cut-off of all Medicaid funds, is unconstitutional. It&para;<br>does not tell us that §1396c can be judicially revised, to&para;<br>say what it does not say. Such a judicial power would&para;<br>not be called the doctrine of severability but perhaps&para;<br>the doctrine of amendatory invalidation—similar to the&para;<br>amendatory veto that permits the Governors of some&para;<br>States to reduce the amounts appropriated in legislation.&para;<br>The proof that such a power does not exist is the fact that&para;<br>it would not preserve other congressional dispositions, but&para;<br>would leave it up to the Court what the “validated” legislation will contain. The Court today opts for permitting&para;<br>the cut-off of only incremental Medicaid funding, but it&para;<br>might just as well have permitted, say, the cut-off of funds&para;<br>that represent no more than x percent of the State’s budget. The Court severs nothing, but simply revises §1396c to&para;<br>read as the Court would desire.&para;<br>We should not accept the Government’s invitation to&para;<br>attempt to solve a constitutional problem by rewriting the&para;<br>Medicaid Expansion so as to allow States that reject it&para;<br>to retain their pre-existing Medicaid funds. Worse, the&para;<br>Government’s remedy, now adopted by the Court, takes&para;<br>the ACA and this Nation in a new direction and charts a&para;<br>course for federalism that the Court, not the Congress, has&para;<br>chosen; but under the Constitution, that power and authority do not rest with this Court.&para;<br>V&para;<br>Severability&para;<br>The Affordable Care Act seeks to achieve “near-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

The two pillars of the Act are the Individual Mandate and the expansion of coverage under Medicaid.&para;<br>In our view, both these central provisions of the Act—the&para;<br>Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion—are invalid.&para;<br>It follows, as some of the parties urge, that all other provisions of the Act must fall as well. The following section&para;<br>explains the severability principles that require this conclusion. This analysis also shows how closely interrelated&para;<br>the Act is, and this is all the more reason why it is judicial&para;<br>usurpation to impose an entirely new mechanism for&para;<br>withdrawal of Medicaid funding, see Part IV–F, supra,&para;<br>which is one of many examples of how rewriting the Act&para;<br>alters its dynamics.&para;<br>A&para;<br>When an unconstitutional provision is but a part of a&para;<br>more comprehensive statute, the question arises as to the&para;<br>validity of the remaining provisions. The Court’s authority to declare a statute partially unconstitutional has been&para;<br>well established since Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137&para;<br>(1803), when the Court severed an unconstitutional provision from the Judiciary Act of 1789. And while the Court&para;<br>has sometimes applied “at least a modest presumption in&para;<br>favor of . . . severability,” C. Nelson, Statutory Interpretation 144 (2010), it has not always done so, see, e.g., Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U. S.&para;<br>172, 190–195 (1999).&para;<br>An automatic or too cursory severance of statutory&para;<br>provisions risks “rewrit[ing] a statute and giv[ing] it an&para;<br>effect altogether different from that sought by the measure viewed as a whole.” Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Alton&para;<br>R. Co., 295 U. S. 330, 362 (1935). The Judiciary, if it&para;<br>orders uncritical severance, then assumes the legislative&para;<br>function; for it imposes on the Nation, by the Court’s&para;<br>decree, its own new statutory regime, consisting of poli-&para;<br>&para;<br>50&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>cies, risks, and duties that Congress did not enact. That&para;<br>can be a more extreme exercise of the judicial power than&para;<br>striking the whole statute and allowing Congress to address the conditions that pertained when the statute was&para;<br>considered at the outset.&para;<br>The Court has applied a two-part guide as the framework for severability analysis. The test has been deemed&para;<br>“well established.” Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480&para;<br>U. S. 678, 684 (1987). First, if the Court holds a statutory&para;<br>provision unconstitutional, it then determines whether&para;<br>the now truncated statute will operate in the manner Congress intended. If not, the remaining provisions must be&para;<br>invalidated. See id., at 685. In Alaska Airlines, the Court&para;<br>clarified that this first inquiry requires more than asking whether “the balance of the legislation is incapable of&para;<br>functioning independently.” Id., at 684. Even if the remaining provisions will operate in some coherent way,&para;<br>that alone does not save the statute. The question is&para;<br>whether the provisions will work as Congress intended.&para;<br>The “relevant inquiry in evaluating severability is whether&para;<br>the statute will function in a manner consistent with&para;<br>the intent of Congress.” Id., at 685 (emphasis in original).&para;<br>See also Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at&para;<br>28) (the Act “remains fully operative as a law with these&para;<br>tenure restrictions excised”) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted); United States v.

S. 727, 767 (1996) (plurality opinion) (“Would Congress still have passed §10(a) had&para;<br>it known that the remaining provisions were invalid”&para;<br>(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).&para;<br>The two inquiries—whether the remaining provisions&para;<br>will operate as Congress designed them, and whether&para;<br>Congress would have enacted the remaining provisions&para;<br>standing alone—often are interrelated. In the ordinary&para;<br>course, if the remaining provisions cannot operate according to the congressional design (the first inquiry), it almost&para;<br>necessarily follows that Congress would not have enacted&para;<br>them (the second inquiry). This close interaction may&para;<br>explain why the Court has not always been precise in&para;<br>distinguishing between the two. There are, however,&para;<br>occasions in which the severability standard’s first inquiry&para;<br>(statutory functionality) is not a proxy for the second&para;<br>inquiry (whether the Legislature intended the remaining&para;<br>provisions to stand alone).&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Act was passed to enable affordable, “near-universal”&para;<br>health insurance coverage.&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(D).&para;<br>The resulting, complex statute consists of mandates and&para;<br>&para;<br>52&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>other requirements; comprehensive regulation and penalties; some undoubted taxes; and increases in some governmental expenditures, decreases in others. Under the&para;<br>severability test set out above, it must be determined if&para;<br>those provisions function in a coherent way and as Congress would have intended, even when the major provisions establishing the Individual Mandate and Medicaid&para;<br>Expansion are themselves invalid.&para;<br>Congress did not intend to establish the goal of nearuniversal coverage without regard to fiscal consequences.&para;<br>See, e.g., ACA §1563, 124 Stat. 270 (“[T]his Act will reduce&para;<br>the Federal deficit between 2010 and 2019”). And it did&para;<br>not intend to impose the inevitable costs on any one industry or group of individuals. The whole design of the Act&para;<br>is to balance the costs and benefits affecting each set&para;<br>of regulated parties. Thus, individuals are required to&para;<br>obtain health insurance. See 26 U. S. C. §5000A(a). Insurance companies are required to sell them insurance regardless of patients’ pre-existing conditions and to comply&para;<br>with a host of other regulations. And the companies must&para;<br>pay new taxes. See §4980I (high-cost insurance plans);&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §§300gg(a)(1), 300gg–4(b) (community rating);&para;<br>§§300gg–1, 300gg–3, 300gg–4(a) (guaranteed issue);&para;<br>§300gg–11 (elimination of coverage limits); §300gg–14(a)&para;<br>(dependent children up to age 26); ACA §§9010, 10905,&para;<br>124 Stat. 865, 1017 (excise tax); Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA) §1401, 124 Stat.&para;<br>1059 (excise tax). States are expected to expand Medicaid&para;<br>eligibility and to create regulated marketplaces called exchanges where individuals can purchase insurance. See&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §§1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) (2006 ed., Supp. IV)&para;<br>(Medicaid Expansion), 18031 (exchanges). Some persons&para;<br>who cannot afford insurance are provided it through the&para;<br>Medicaid Expansion, and others are aided in their purchase of insurance through federal subsidies available on&para;<br>health-insurance exchanges. See 26 U. S. C. §36B (2006&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>53&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ed., Supp. IV), 42 U. S. C. §18071 (2006 ed., Supp. IV)&para;<br>(federal subsidies). The Federal Government’s increased&para;<br>spending is offset by new taxes and cuts in other federal&para;<br>expenditures, including reductions in Medicare and in&para;<br>federal payments to hospitals. See, e.g., §1395ww(r) (Medicare cuts); ACA Title IX, Subtitle A, 124 Stat. 847 (“Revenue Offset Provisions”). Employers with at least 50&para;<br>employees must either provide employees with adequate&para;<br>health benefits or pay a financial exaction if an employee&para;<br>who qualifies for federal subsidies purchases insurance&para;<br>through an exchange. See 26 U. S. C. §4980H (2006 ed.,&para;<br>Supp. IV).&para;<br>In short, the Act attempts to achieve near-universal&para;<br>health insurance coverage by spreading its costs to individuals, insurers, governments, hospitals, and employers—&para;<br>while, at the same time, offsetting significant portions&para;<br>of those costs with new benefits to each group. For example, the Federal Government bears the burden of paying billions for the new entitlements mandated by the&para;<br>Medicaid Expansion and federal subsidies for insurance&para;<br>purchases on the exchanges; but it benefits from reductions in the reimbursements it pays to hospitals. Hospitals lose those reimbursements; but they benefit from the&para;<br>decrease in uncompensated care, for under the insurance&para;<br>regulations it is easier for individuals with pre-existing&para;<br>conditions to purchase coverage that increases payments&para;<br>to hospitals. Insurance companies bear new costs imposed&para;<br>by a collection of insurance regulations and taxes, including&para;<br>“guaranteed issue” and “community rating” requirements&para;<br>to give coverage regardless of the insured’s pre-existing&para;<br>conditions; but the insurers benefit from the new, healthy&para;<br>purchasers who are forced by the Individual Mandate&para;<br>to buy the insurers’ product and from the new lowincome Medicaid recipients who will enroll in insurance&para;<br>companies’ Medicaid-funded managed care programs. In&para;<br>summary, the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expan-&para;<br>&para;<br>54&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>sion offset insurance regulations and taxes, which offset&para;<br>reduced reimbursements to hospitals, which offset increases in federal spending. So, the Act’s major provisions&para;<br>are interdependent.&para;<br>The Act then refers to these interdependencies as&para;<br>“shared responsibility.” See ACA Subtitle F, Title I, 124&para;<br>Stat. 242 (“Shared Responsibility”); ACA §1501, ibid.&para;<br>(same); ACA §1513, id., at 253 (same); ACA §4980H, ibid.&para;<br>(same). In at least six places, the Act describes the Individual Mandate as working “together with the other provisions of this Act.” 42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(C) (2006 ed.,&para;<br>Supp. IV) (working “together” to “add millions of new&para;<br>consumers to the health insurance market”); §18091(2)(E)&para;<br>(working “together” to “significantly reduce” the economic&para;<br>cost of the poorer health and shorter lifespan of the uninsured); §18091(2)(F) (working “together” to “lower health&para;<br>insurance premiums”); §18091(2)(G) (working “together” to&para;<br>“improve financial security for families”); §18091(2)(I)&para;<br>(working “together” to minimize “adverse selection and&para;<br>broaden the health insurance risk pool to include healthy&para;<br>individuals”); §18091(2)(J) (working “together” to “significantly reduce administrative costs and lower health&para;<br>insurance premiums”). The Act calls the Individual Mandate “an essential part” of federal regulation of health&para;<br>insurance and warns that “the absence of the requirement&para;<br>would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance&para;<br>market.” §18091(2)(H).&para;<br>C&para;<br>One preliminary point should be noted before applying&para;<br>severability principles to the Act. To be sure, an argument&para;<br>can be made that those portions of the Act that none of the&para;<br>parties has standing to challenge cannot be held nonseverable. The response to this argument is that our cases&para;<br>do not support it. See, e.g., Williams v. Standard Oil Co.&para;<br>of La., 278 U. S. 235, 242–244 (1929) (holding nonsever-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

It would take years, perhaps&para;<br>decades, for each of its provisions to be adjudicated separately—and for some of them (those simply expending&para;<br>federal funds) no one may have separate standing. The&para;<br>Federal Government, the States, and private parties ought&para;<br>to know at once whether the entire legislation fails.&para;<br>The opinion now explains in Part V–C–1, infra, why the&para;<br>Act’s major provisions are not severable from the Mandate&para;<br>and Medicaid Expansion. It proceeds from the insurance&para;<br>regulations and taxes (C–1–a), to the reductions in reimbursements to hospitals and other Medicare reductions&para;<br>(C–1–b), the exchanges and their federal subsidies (C–1–c),&para;<br>and the employer responsibility assessment (C–1–d).&para;<br>Part V–C–2, infra, explains why the Act’s minor provisions also are not severable.&para;<br>1&para;<br>The Act’s Major Provisions&para;<br>Major provisions of the Affordable Care Act—i.e., the&para;<br>insurance regulations and taxes, the reductions in federal&para;<br>reimbursements to hospitals and other Medicare spending reductions, the exchanges and their federal subsidies,&para;<br>and the employer responsibility assessment—cannot remain&para;<br>once the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion are&para;<br>invalid. That result follows from the undoubted inability&para;<br>of the other major provisions to operate as Congress intended without the Individual Mandate and Medicaid&para;<br>Expansion. Absent the invalid portions, the other major&para;<br>provisions could impose enormous risks of unexpected burdens on patients, the health-care community, and the&para;<br>federal budget. That consequence would be in absolute&para;<br>conflict with the ACA’s design of “shared responsibility,”&para;<br>and would pose a threat to the Nation that Congress did&para;<br>&para;<br>56&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

What is known, however, is&para;<br>that severing other provisions from the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion necessarily would impose&para;<br>significant risks and real uncertainties on insurance companies, their customers, all other major actors in the system, and the government treasury. And what also is&para;<br>known is this: Unnecessary risks and avoidable uncertainties are hostile to economic progress and fiscal stability&para;<br>and thus to the safety and welfare of the Nation and the&para;<br>Nation’s freedom. If those risks and uncertainties are to&para;<br>be imposed, it must not be by the Judiciary.&para;<br>b&para;<br>Reductions in Reimbursements to Hospitals and&para;<br>Other Reductions in Medicare Expenditures&para;<br>The Affordable Care Act reduces payments by the Federal Government to hospitals by more than $200 billion&para;<br>over 10 years. See 42 U. S. C. §1395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)–(xii)&para;<br>(2006 ed., Supp. IV); §1395ww(q); §1395ww(r); §1396r–&para;<br>4(f)(7).&para;<br>The concept is straightforward: Near-universal coverage&para;<br>will reduce uncompensated care, which will increase hospitals’ revenues, which will offset the government’s reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to&para;<br>hospitals. Responsibility will be shared, as burdens and&para;<br>benefits balance each other. This is typical of the whole&para;<br>dynamic of the Act.&para;<br>Invalidating the key mechanisms for expanding insurance coverage, such as community rating and the Medicaid Expansion, without invalidating the reductions in&para;<br>Medicare and Medicaid, distorts the ACA’s design of&para;<br>“shared responsibility.” Some hospitals may be forced to&para;<br>raise the cost of care in order to offset the reductions in&para;<br>reimbursements, which could raise the cost of insurance&para;<br>premiums, in contravention of the Act’s goal of “lower[ing]&para;<br>&para;<br>58&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>health insurance premiums.” 42 U. S. C. §18091(2)(F)&para;<br>(2006 ed., Supp. IV). See also §18091(2)(I) (goal of&para;<br>“lower[ing] health insurance premiums”); §18091(2)(J)&para;<br>(same). Other hospitals, particularly safety-net hospitals that&para;<br>serve a large number of uninsured patients, may be forced&para;<br>to shut down. Cf. National Assn. of Public Hospitals, 2009&para;<br>Annual Survey: Safety Net Hospitals and Health Systems&para;<br>Fulfill Mission in Uncertain Times 5–6 (Feb. 2011). Like&para;<br>the effect of preserving the insurance regulations and&para;<br>taxes, the precise degree of risk to hospitals is unknowable. It is not the proper role of the Court, by severing&para;<br>part of a statute and allowing the rest to stand, to impose&para;<br>unknowable risks that Congress could neither measure&para;<br>nor predict. And Congress could not have intended that&para;<br>result in any event.&para;<br>There is a second, independent reason why the reductions in reimbursements to hospitals and the ACA’s other&para;<br>Medicare cuts must be invalidated. The ACA’s $455 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings offset the $434billion cost of the Medicaid Expansion. See CBO Estimate, Table 2 (Mar. 20, 2010). The reductions allowed&para;<br>Congress to find that the ACA “will reduce the Federal&para;<br>deficit between 2010 and 2019” and “will continue to&para;<br>reduce budget deficits after 2019.” ACA §§1563(a)(1), (2),&para;<br>124 Stat. 270.&para;<br>That finding was critical to the ACA. The Act’s “shared&para;<br>responsibility” concept extends to the federal budget.&para;<br>Congress chose to offset new federal expenditures with&para;<br>budget cuts and tax increases. That is why the United&para;<br>States has explained in the course of this litigation that&para;<br>“[w]hen Congress passed the ACA, it was careful to ensure&para;<br>that any increased spending, including on Medicaid, was&para;<br>offset by other revenue-raising and cost-saving provisions.” Memorandum in Support of Government’s Motion&para;<br>for Summary Judgment in No. 3–10–cv–91, p. 41.&para;<br>If the Medicare and Medicaid reductions would no longer&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

They would lose their justification and&para;<br>foundation. In addition, to preserve them would be “to&para;<br>eliminate a significant quid pro quo of the legislative compromise” and create a statute Congress did not enact.&para;<br>Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533,&para;<br>561 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). It is no secret that&para;<br>cutting Medicare is unpopular; and it is most improbable&para;<br>Congress would have done so without at least the assurance that it would render the ACA deficit-neutral. See&para;<br>ACA §§1563(a)(1), (2), 124 Stat. 270.&para;<br>c&para;<br>Health Insurance Exchanges and Their Federal&para;<br>Subsidies&para;<br>The ACA requires each State to establish a healthinsurance “exchange.” Each exchange is a one-stop marketplace for individuals and small businesses to compare&para;<br>community-rated health insurance and purchase the&para;<br>policy of their choice. The exchanges cannot operate in the&para;<br>manner Congress intended if the Individual Mandate,&para;<br>Medicaid Expansion, and insurance regulations cannot&para;<br>remain in force.&para;<br>The Act’s design is to allocate billions of federal dollars&para;<br>to subsidize individuals’ purchases on the exchanges. Individuals with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of&para;<br>the poverty level receive tax credits to offset the cost of&para;<br>insurance to the individual purchaser. 26 U. S. C. §36B&para;<br>(2006 ed., Supp. IV); 42 U. S. C. §18071 (2006 ed., Supp.&para;<br>IV). By 2019, 20 million of the 24 million people who will&para;<br>obtain insurance through an exchange are expected to&para;<br>receive an average federal subsidy of $6,460 per person.&para;<br>See CBO, Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation&para;<br>Enacted in March 2010, pp. 18–19 (Mar. 30, 2011). Without the community-rating insurance regulation, however,&para;<br>&para;<br>60&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>the average federal subsidy could be much higher; for&para;<br>community rating greatly lowers the enormous premiums&para;<br>unhealthy individuals would otherwise pay.&para;<br>Federal&para;<br>subsidies would make up much of the difference.&para;<br>The result would be an unintended boon to insurance&para;<br>companies, an unintended harm to the federal fisc, and&para;<br>a corresponding breakdown of the “shared responsibility” between the industry and the federal budget that&para;<br>Congress intended. Thus, the federal subsidies must be&para;<br>invalidated.&para;<br>In the absence of federal subsidies to purchasers, insurance companies will have little incentive to sell insurance&para;<br>on the exchanges. Under the ACA’s scheme, few, if any,&para;<br>individuals would want to buy individual insurance policies outside of an exchange, because federal subsidies&para;<br>would be unavailable outside of an exchange. Difficulty in&para;<br>attracting individuals outside of the exchange would in&para;<br>turn motivate insurers to enter exchanges, despite the&para;<br>exchanges’ onerous regulations. See 42 U. S. C. §18031.&para;<br>That system of incentives collapses if the federal subsidies&para;<br>are invalidated. Without the federal subsidies, individuals would lose the main incentive to purchase insurance&para;<br>inside the exchanges, and some insurers may be unwilling&para;<br>to offer insurance inside of exchanges. With fewer buyers&para;<br>and even fewer sellers, the exchanges would not operate&para;<br>as Congress intended and may not operate at all.&para;<br>There is a second reason why, if community rating is&para;<br>invalidated by the Mandate and Medicaid Expansion’s&para;<br>invalidity, exchanges cannot be implemented in a manner&para;<br>consistent with the Act’s design. A key purpose of an&para;<br>exchange is to provide a marketplace of insurance options&para;<br>where prices are standardized regardless of the buyer’s pre-existing conditions. See ibid. An individual who&para;<br>shops for insurance through an exchange will evaluate&para;<br>different insurance products. The products will offer&para;<br>different benefits and prices. Congress designed the ex-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012) &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>61&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>changes so the shopper can compare benefits and prices.&para;<br>But the comparison cannot be made in the way Congress&para;<br>designed if the prices depend on the shopper’s pre-existing&para;<br>health conditions. The prices would vary from person to&para;<br>person. So without community rating—which prohibits&para;<br>insurers from basing the price of insurance on pre-existing&para;<br>conditions—the exchanges cannot operate in the manner&para;<br>Congress intended.&para;<br>d&para;<br>Employer-Responsibility Assessment&para;<br>The employer responsibility assessment provides an&para;<br>incentive for employers with at least 50 employees to&para;<br>provide their employees with health insurance options&para;<br>that meet minimum criteria. See 26 U. S. C. §4980H&para;<br>(2006 ed., Supp. IV). Unlike the Individual Mandate,&para;<br>the employer-responsibility assessment does not require&para;<br>employers to provide an insurance option. Instead, it requires them to make a payment to the Federal Government if they do not offer insurance to employees and if&para;<br>insurance is bought on an exchange by an employee who&para;<br>qualifies for the exchange’s federal subsidies. See ibid.&para;<br>For two reasons, the employer-responsibility assessment&para;<br>must be invalidated. First, the ACA makes a direct link&para;<br>between the employer-responsibility assessment and the&para;<br>exchanges. The financial assessment against employers&para;<br>occurs only under certain conditions. One of them is the&para;<br>purchase of insurance by an employee on an exchange.&para;<br>With no exchanges, there are no purchases on the exchanges; and with no purchases on the exchanges, there is&para;<br>nothing to trigger the employer-responsibility assessment.&para;<br>Second, after the invalidation of burdens on individuals&para;<br>(the Individual Mandate), insurers (the insurance regulations and taxes), States (the Medicaid Expansion), the&para;<br>Federal Government (the federal subsidies for exchanges&para;<br>and for the Medicaid Expansion), and hospitals (the reduc-&para;<br>&para;<br>62&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>tions in reimbursements), the preservation of the employerresponsibility assessment would upset the ACA’s design&para;<br>of “shared responsibility.” It would leave employers as the&para;<br>only parties bearing any significant responsibility. That&para;<br>was not the congressional intent.&para;<br>2&para;<br>The Act’s Minor Provisions&para;<br>The next question is whether the invalidation of the&para;<br>ACA’s major provisions requires the Court to invalidate&para;<br>the ACA’s other provisions. It does.&para;<br>The ACA is over 900 pages long. Its regulations include&para;<br>requirements ranging from a break time and secluded&para;<br>place at work for nursing mothers, see 29 U. S. C. §207(r)(1)&para;<br>(2006 ed., Supp. IV), to displays of nutritional content&para;<br>at chain restaurants, see 21 U. S. C. §343(q)(5)(H).&para;<br>The Act raises billions of dollars in taxes and fees, including exactions imposed on high-income taxpayers, see ACA&para;<br>§§9015, 10906; HCERA §1402, medical devices, see 26&para;<br>U. S. C. §4191 (2006 ed., Supp. IV), and tanning booths,&para;<br>see §5000B. It spends government money on, among other&para;<br>things, the study of how to spend less government money.&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §1315a. And it includes a number of provisions&para;<br>that provide benefits to the State of a particular legislator.&para;<br>For example, §10323, 124 Stat. 954, extends Medicare&para;<br>coverage to individuals exposed to asbestos from a mine in&para;<br>Libby, Montana. Another provision, §2006, id., at 284,&para;<br>increases Medicaid payments only in Louisiana.&para;<br>Such provisions validate the Senate Majority Leader’s&para;<br>statement, “ ‘I don’t know if there is a senator that doesn’t&para;<br>have something in this bill that was important to them.&para;<br>. . . [And] if they don’t have something in it important to&para;<br>them, then it doesn’t speak well of them. That’s what this&para;<br>legislation is all about: It’s the art of compromise.’ ” Pear,&para;<br>In Health Bill for Everyone, Provisions for a Few, N. Y.&para;<br>Times, Jan. 4, 2010, p.

So, if the major provision were unconstitutional, Congress would not have passed the minor one.&para;<br>Without the ACA’s major provisions, many of these&para;<br>minor provisions will not operate in the manner Congress&para;<br>intended. For example, the tax increases are “Revenue&para;<br>Offset Provisions” designed to help offset the cost to the&para;<br>Federal Government of programs like the Medicaid Expansion and the exchanges’ federal subsidies. See Title&para;<br>IX, Subtitle A—Revenue Offset Provisions, 124 Stat. 847.&para;<br>With the Medicaid Expansion and the exchanges invalidated, the tax increases no longer operate to offset costs,&para;<br>and they no longer serve the purpose in the Act’s scheme&para;<br>of “shared responsibility” that Congress intended.&para;<br>Some provisions, such as requiring chain restaurants to&para;<br>display nutritional content, appear likely to operate as&para;<br>Congress intended, but they fail the second test for severability. There is no reason to believe that Congress would&para;<br>have enacted them independently. The Court has not&para;<br>previously had occasion to consider severability in the context of an omnibus enactment like the ACA, which includes not only many provisions that are ancillary to its&para;<br>central provisions but also many that are entirely unrelated—hitched on because it was a quick way to get them&para;<br>passed despite opposition, or because their proponents&para;<br>could exact their enactment as the quid pro quo for their&para;<br>needed support. When we are confronted with such a socalled “Christmas tree,” a law to which many nongermane&para;<br>ornaments have been attached, we think the proper rule&para;<br>must be that when the tree no longer exists the ornaments&para;<br>are superfluous. We have no reliable basis for knowing&para;<br>which pieces of the Act would have passed on their own. It&para;<br>is certain that many of them would not have, and it is not&para;<br>a proper function of this Court to guess which. To sever&para;<br>the statute in that manner “ ‘would be to make a new law,&para;<br>not to enforce an old one. This is not part of our duty.’ ”&para;<br>&para;<br>64&para;<br>&para;<br>NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT &para;<br>&para;<br>BUSINESS v.

For those reasons, the unconstitutionality of both the Individual Mandate and the Medicaid&para;<br>Expansion requires the invalidation of the Affordable Care&para;<br>Act’s other provisions.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The Court today decides to save a statute Congress did&para;<br>not write. It rules that what the statute declares to be a&para;<br>requirement with a penalty is instead an option subject&para;<br>to a tax. And it changes the intentionally coercive sanction of a total cut-off of Medicaid funds to a supposedly&para;<br>noncoercive cut-off of only the incremental funds that the&para;<br>Act makes available.&para;<br>The Court regards its strained statutory interpretation&para;<br>as judicial modesty. It is not. It amounts instead to a vast&para;<br>judicial overreaching. It creates a debilitated, inoperable&para;<br>version of health-care regulation that Congress did not&para;<br>enact and the public does not expect. It makes enactment&para;<br>of sensible health-care regulation more difficult, since&para;<br>Congress cannot start afresh but must take as its point of&para;<br>departure a jumble of now senseless provisions, provisions&para;<br>that certain interests favored under the Court’s new design will struggle to retain. And it leaves the public and&para;<br>the States to expend vast sums of money on requirements&para;<br>that may or may not survive the necessary congressional&para;<br>revision.&para;<br>The Court’s disposition, invented and atextual as it is,&para;<br>does not even have the merit of avoiding constitutional&para;<br>difficulties. It creates them.
