Title 18 U. S. C. §3582(c)(2) per&para;<br>mits a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment&para;<br>“based on” a Guidelines sentencing range that has subsequently been&para;<br>lowered by retroactive amendment to move for a sentence reduction.&para;<br>This case concerns §3582(c)(2)’s application to cases in which the de&para;<br>fendant and the Government have entered into a plea agreement un&para;<br>der Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), which permits&para;<br>the parties to “agree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is&para;<br>the appropriate disposition of the case,” and “binds the court [to the&para;<br>agreed-upon sentence] once [it] accepts the plea agreement.”&para;<br>Petitioner Freeman was indicted for various crimes, including pos&para;<br>sessing with intent to distribute cocaine base. 21 U. S. C. §841(a)(1).&para;<br>He entered into an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement to plead guilty to all&para;<br>charges; in return the Government agreed to a 106-month sentence.&para;<br>The agreement states that the parties independently reviewed the&para;<br>applicable Guidelines, noted that Freeman agreed to have his sen&para;<br>tence determined under the Guidelines, and reflected the parties’ un&para;<br>derstanding that the agreed-to sentence corresponded with the&para;<br>minimum sentence suggested by the applicable Guidelines range of&para;<br>46 to 57 months, along with a consecutive mandatory minimum of 60&para;<br>months for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking&para;<br>crime under 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A). Three years after the District&para;<br>Court accepted the plea agreement, the Commission issued a retroac&para;<br>tive Guidelines amendment to remedy the significant disparity be&para;<br>tween the penalties for cocaine base and powder cocaine offenses.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Because the amendment’s effect was to reduce Freeman’s applicable&para;<br>sentencing range to 37 to 46 months plus the consecutive 60-month&para;<br>mandatory minimum, he moved for a sentence reduction under&para;<br>§3582(c)(2). However, the District Court denied the motion, and the&para;<br>Sixth Circuit affirmed because its precedent rendered defendants&para;<br>sentenced pursuant to 11(c)(1)(C) agreements ineligible for&para;<br>§3582(c)(2) relief, barring a miscarriage of justice or mutual mistake.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.&para;<br>355 Fed. Appx. 1, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER,&para;<br>and JUSTICE KAGAN, concluded that defendants who enter into&para;<br>11(c)(1)(C) agreements that specify a particular sentence as a condi&para;<br>tion of the guilty plea may be eligible for relief under §3582(c)(2). Pp.&para;<br>5–10.&para;<br>(a) The text and purpose of the statute, Rule 11(c)(1)(C), and the&para;<br>governing Guidelines policy statements compel the conclusion that&para;<br>the district court has authority to entertain §3582(c)(2) motions when&para;<br>sentences are imposed in light of the Guidelines, even if the defen&para;<br>dant enters into an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement. The district judge must,&para;<br>in every case, impose “a sentence sufficient, but not greater than nec&para;<br>essary, to comply with” the purposes of federal sentencing, in light of&para;<br>the Guidelines and other relevant factors. §3553(a). The Guidelines&para;<br>provide a framework or starting point—a basis, in the term’s com&para;<br>monsense meaning—for the judge’s exercise of discretion. Rule&para;<br>11(c)(1)(C) permits the defendant and the prosecutor to agree on a&para;<br>specific sentence, but that agreement does not discharge the district&para;<br>court’s independent obligation to exercise its discretion. In the usual&para;<br>sentencing, whether following trial or plea, the judge’s reliance on the&para;<br>Guidelines will be apparent when the judge uses the Guidelines&para;<br>range as the starting point in the analysis and imposes a sentence&para;<br>within the range. Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49. Even&para;<br>where the judge varies from the recommended range, id., at 50, if the&para;<br>judge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point to explain the&para;<br>deviation, then the Guidelines are in a real sense a basis for the sen&para;<br>tence. The parties’ recommended sentence binds the court “once the&para;<br>court accepts the plea agreement,” Rule 11(c)(1)(C), but the relevant&para;<br>policy statement forbids the judge to accept an agreement without&para;<br>first giving due consideration to the applicable Guidelines sentencing&para;<br>range, even if the parties recommend a specific sentence as a condi&para;<br>tion of the guilty plea, see U. S. Sentencing Commission, Guidelines&para;<br>Manual §6B1.2. This approach finds further support in the policy&para;<br>statement applicable to §3582(c)(2) motions, which instructs the dis&para;<br>trict court in modifying a sentence to substitute the retroactive&para;<br>amendment, but to leave all original Guidelines determinations in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>place, §1B1.10(b)(1). Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>(b) Petitioner’s sentencing hearing transcript reveals that the Dis&para;<br>trict Court expressed its independent judgment that the sentence&para;<br>was appropriate in light of the applicable Guidelines range. Its deci&para;<br>sion was therefore “based on” that range within §3582(c)(2)’s mean&para;<br>ing. P. 7.&para;<br>(c) The Government’s argument that sentences that follow an&para;<br>11(c)(1)(C) agreement are based only on the agreement itself and not&para;<br>the Guidelines, and are therefore ineligible for §3582(c)(2) reduction,&para;<br>must be rejected. Even when a defendant enters into an 11(c)(1)(C)&para;<br>agreement, the judge’s decision to accept the plea and impose the&para;<br>recommended sentence is likely to be based on the Guidelines; and&para;<br>when it is, the defendant should be eligible to seek §3582(c)(2) relief.&para;<br>Pp. 7–10.&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR concluded that if an agreement under Federal&para;<br>Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) ((C) agreement) expressly uses&para;<br>a Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the charged offense to es&para;<br>tablish the term of imprisonment, and that range is subsequently&para;<br>lowered by the Sentencing Commission, the prison term is “based on”&para;<br>the range employed and the defendant is eligible for sentence reduc&para;<br>tion under 18 U. S. C. §3582(c)(2). Pp. 1–11.&para;<br>(a) The term of imprisonment imposed by a district court pursuant&para;<br>to a (C) agreement is “based on” the agreement itself, not on the&para;<br>judge’s calculation of the Guidelines sentencing range. To hold oth&para;<br>erwise would be to contravene the very purpose of (C) agreements—to&para;<br>bind the district court and allow the Government and the defendant&para;<br>to determine what sentence he will receive. Pp. 1–5.&para;<br>(b) This does not mean, however, that a term of imprisonment im&para;<br>posed under a (C) agreement can never be reduced under §3582(c)(2).&para;<br>Because the very purpose of a (C) agreement is to allow the parties to&para;<br>determine the defendant’s sentence, when the agreement itself em&para;<br>ploys a particular Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the&para;<br>charged offenses in establishing the term of imprisonment imposed&para;<br>by the district court, the defendant is eligible to have his sentence re&para;<br>duced under §3582(c)(2). Pp. 5–9.&para;<br>(c) Freeman is eligible. The offense level and criminal history cate&para;<br>gory set forth in his (C) agreement produce a sentencing range of 46&para;<br>to 57 months; it is evident that the parties combined the 46-month&para;<br>figure at the low end of the range with the 60-month mandatory&para;<br>minimum sentence under §924(c)(1)(A) to establish the 106-month&para;<br>sentence called for in the agreement. Under the amended Guide&para;<br>lines, however, the applicable sentencing range is now 37 to 46&para;<br>months. Therefore, Freeman’s prison term is “based on” a sentencing&para;<br>range that “has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Com&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>mission,” rendering him eligible for sentence reduction.

S. C. §3551&para;<br>et seq., calls for the creation of Sentencing Guidelines to&para;<br>inform judicial discretion in order to reduce unwarranted&para;<br>disparities in federal sentencing. The Act allows retro&para;<br>active amendments to the Guidelines for cases where&para;<br>the Guidelines become a cause of inequality, not a bulwark&para;<br>against it. When a retroactive Guideline amendment is&para;<br>adopted, §3582(c)(2) permits defendants sentenced based&para;<br>on a sentencing range that has been modified to move for&para;<br>a reduced sentence.&para;<br>The question here is whether defendants who enter into&para;<br>plea agreements that recommend a particular sentence&para;<br>as a condition of the guilty plea may be eligible for relief&para;<br>under §3582(c)(2). See Fed. R. Crim. Proc. 11(c)(1)(C)&para;<br>(authorizing such plea agreements). The Court of Appeals&para;<br>for the Sixth Circuit held that, barring a miscarriage of&para;<br>justice or mutual mistake, defendants who enter into&para;<br>11(c)(1)(C) agreements cannot benefit from retroactive&para;<br>Guideline amendments.&para;<br>Five Members of the Court agree that this judgment&para;<br>must be reversed. The Justices who join this plurality&para;<br>opinion conclude that the categorical bar enacted by the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Court of Appeals finds no support in §3582(c)(2), Rule&para;<br>11(c)(1)(C), or the relevant Guidelines policy statements.&para;<br>In every case the judge must exercise discretion to im&para;<br>pose an appropriate sentence. This discretion, in turn, is&para;<br>framed by the Guidelines. And the Guidelines must be&para;<br>consulted, in the regular course, whether the case is one in&para;<br>which the conviction was after a trial or after a plea,&para;<br>including a plea pursuant to an agreement that recom&para;<br>mends a particular sentence. The district judge’s decision&para;<br>to impose a sentence may therefore be based on the Guide&para;<br>lines even if the defendant agrees to plead guilty under&para;<br>Rule 11(c)(1)(C). Where the decision to impose a sentence&para;<br>is based on a range later subject to retroactive amend&para;<br>ment, §3582(c)(2) permits a sentence reduction.&para;<br>Section 3582(c)(2) empowers district judges to correct sen&para;<br>tences that depend on frameworks that later prove un&para;<br>justified. There is no reason to deny §3582(c)(2) relief to&para;<br>defendants who linger in prison pursuant to sentences&para;<br>that would not have been imposed but for a since-rejected,&para;<br>excessive range.&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would reverse the judgment on a&para;<br>different ground set out in the opinion concurring in the&para;<br>judgment. That opinion, like the dissent, would hold that&para;<br>sentences following 11(c)(1)(C) agreement are based on the&para;<br>agreement rather than the Guidelines, and therefore that&para;<br>§3582(c)(2) relief is not available in the typical case. But&para;<br>unlike the dissent she would permit the petitioner here to&para;<br>seek a sentence reduction because his plea agreement in&para;<br>express terms ties the recommended sentence to the&para;<br>Guidelines sentencing range.&para;<br>The reasons that lead those Members of the Court who&para;<br>join this plurality opinion may be set forth as follows.&para;<br>I&para;<br>A&para;<br>Federal courts are forbidden, as a general matter, to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

C. §3582(c); but the rule of finality is subject to a&para;<br>few narrow exceptions. Here, the exception is contained in&para;<br>a statutory provision enacted to permit defendants whose&para;<br>Guidelines sentencing range has been lowered by retro&para;<br>active amendment to move for a sentence reduction if the&para;<br>terms of the statute are met. The statute provides:&para;<br>“In the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to&para;<br>a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range&para;<br>that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing&para;<br>Commission pursuant to 28 U. S. C. 994(o) . . . the&para;<br>court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after&para;<br>considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to&para;<br>the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction&para;<br>is consistent with applicable policy statements issued&para;<br>by the Sentencing Commission.” §3582(c)(2).&para;<br>This case concerns the application of the statute to cases&para;<br>in which defendants enter into plea agreements under&para;<br>Rule 11(c)(1)(C). That Rule permits the parties to “agree&para;<br>that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appro&para;<br>priate disposition of the case, . . . [a request which] binds&para;<br>the court once the court accepts the plea agreement.” The&para;<br>question is whether defendants who enter into 11(c)(1)(C)&para;<br>agreements that specify a particular sentence may be said&para;<br>to have been sentenced “based on” a Guidelines sentencing&para;<br>range, making them eligible for relief under §3582(c)(2).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Petitioner William Freeman was indicted in 2005 for&para;<br>various crimes, including possessing with intent to dis&para;<br>tribute cocaine base. 21 U. S. C. §§841(a)(1); (b)(1)(C). He&para;<br>entered into an agreement under Rule 11(c)(1)(C) in which&para;<br>he agreed to plead guilty to all charges. In return the&para;<br>Government “agree[d] that a sentence of 106 months’ in&para;<br>carceration is the appropriate disposition of this case.”&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>App. 26a. The agreement states that “[b]oth parties have&para;<br>independently reviewed the Sentencing Guidelines appli&para;<br>cable in this case,” and that “[Freeman] agrees to have his&para;<br>sentence determined pursuant to the Sentencing Guide&para;<br>lines.” The agreement reflects the parties’ expectation&para;<br>that Freeman would face a Guidelines range of 46 to 57&para;<br>months, id., at 27a–28a (Offense Level 19, Criminal His&para;<br>tory Category IV), along with a consecutive mandatory&para;<br>minimum of 60 months for possessing a firearm in fur&para;<br>therance of a drug-trafficking crime under 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§924(c)(1)(A). The recommended sentence of 106 months&para;<br>thus corresponded with the minimum sentence suggested&para;<br>by the Guidelines, in addition to the 60-month §924(c)&para;<br>(1)(A) sentence.&para;<br>The District Court accepted the plea agreement. At the&para;<br>sentencing hearing, the court “adopt[ed] the findings of&para;<br>the probation officer disclosed in the probation report and&para;<br>application of the guidelines as set out therein.” App. 47a.&para;<br>“[H]aving considered the advisory guidelines and 18 USC&para;<br>3553(a),” the court imposed the recommended 106-month&para;<br>sentence, which was “within the guideline ranges”—the&para;<br>46- to 57-month range the parties had anticipated plus the&para;<br>mandatory 60 months under §924(c)(1)(A)—and “sufficient&para;<br>to meet the objectives of the law.” Id. at 48a–49a.&para;<br>Three years later, the Commission issued a retroactive&para;<br>amendment to the Guidelines to remedy the significant&para;<br>disparity between the penalties for cocaine base and pow&para;<br>der cocaine offenses. See United States Sentencing Com&para;<br>mission, Guidelines Manual Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706&para;<br>(Nov. 2010) (USSG) (effective Nov. 1, 2007) (adjusting&para;<br>Guidelines); id., Amdt. 713 (effective Mar. 3, 2008) (mak&para;<br>ing Amendment 706 retroactive).

The District Court, however, denied the&para;<br>motion, and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit&para;<br>affirmed. United States v. Goins, 355 Fed. Appx. 1 (2009).&para;<br>Adhering to its decision in United States v. Peveler, 359&para;<br>F. 3d 369 (2004), the Court of Appeals held that defen&para;<br>dants sentenced following 11(c)(1)(C) agreements that&para;<br>specify a particular sentence are ineligible for §3582(c)(2)&para;<br>relief, barring a miscarriage of justice or mutual mistake.&para;<br>This Court granted certiorari. 561 U. S. __ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Federal sentencing law requires the district judge in&para;<br>every case to impose “a sentence sufficient, but not greater&para;<br>than necessary, to comply with” the purposes of federal&para;<br>sentencing, in light of the Guidelines and other §3553(a)&para;<br>factors. 18 U. S. C. §3553(a). The Guidelines provide a&para;<br>framework or starting point—a basis, in the commonsense&para;<br>meaning of the term—for the judge’s exercise of discretion.&para;<br>E.g., 1 Oxford English Dictionary 977 (2d ed. 1989). Rule&para;<br>11(c)(1)(C) permits the defendant and the prosecutor to&para;<br>agree that a specific sentence is appropriate, but that&para;<br>agreement does not discharge the district court’s inde&para;<br>pendent obligation to exercise its discretion. In the usual&para;<br>sentencing, whether following trial or plea, the judge’s&para;<br>reliance on the Guidelines will be apparent, for the judge&para;<br>will use the Guidelines range as the starting point in the&para;<br>analysis and impose a sentence within the range. Gall v.&para;<br>United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49 (2007). Even where the&para;<br>judge varies from the recommended range, id., at 50, if the&para;<br>judge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point to&para;<br>explain the decision to deviate from it, then the Guidelines&para;<br>are in a real sense a basis for the sentence.&para;<br>Rule 11(c)(1)(C) makes the parties’ recommended sen&para;<br>tence binding on the court “once the court accepts the plea&para;<br>agreement,” but the governing policy statement confirms&para;<br>that the court’s acceptance is itself based on the Guide&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>lines. See USSG §6B1.2. That policy statement forbids&para;<br>the district judge to accept an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement with&para;<br>out first evaluating the recommended sentence in light&para;<br>of the defendant’s applicable sentencing range. The com&para;<br>mentary to §6B1.2 advises that a court may accept an&para;<br>11(c)(1)(C) agreement “only if the court is satisfied either&para;<br>that such sentence is an appropriate sentence within the&para;<br>applicable guideline range or, if not, that the sentence de&para;<br>parts from the applicable guideline range for justifiable&para;<br>reasons.” Cf. Stinson v. United States, 508 U. S. 36 (1993)&para;<br>(Guidelines commentary is authoritative). Any bargain&para;<br>between the parties is contingent until the court accepts&para;<br>the agreement. The Guidelines require the district judge&para;<br>to give due consideration to the relevant sentencing range,&para;<br>even if the defendant and prosecutor recommend a specific&para;<br>sentence as a condition of the guilty plea.&para;<br>This approach finds further support in the policy state&para;<br>ment that applies to §3582(c)(2) motions. See USSG&para;<br>§1B1.10. It instructs the district court in modifying a&para;<br>sentence to substitute only the retroactive amendment&para;<br>and then leave all original Guidelines determinations in&para;<br>place. §1B1.10(b)(1). In other words, the policy statement&para;<br>seeks to isolate whatever marginal effect the since&para;<br>rejected Guideline had on the defendant’s sentence. Work&para;<br>ing backwards from this purpose, §3582(c)(2) modification&para;<br>proceedings should be available to permit the district&para;<br>court to revisit a prior sentence to whatever extent the&para;<br>sentencing range in question was a relevant part of the&para;<br>analytic framework the judge used to determine the sen&para;<br>tence or to approve the agreement. This is the only rule&para;<br>consistent with the governing policy statement, a state&para;<br>ment that rests on the premise that a Guideline range&para;<br>may be one of many factors that determine the sentence&para;<br>imposed.&para;<br>Thus, the text and purpose of the three relevant&para;<br>sources—the statute, the Rule, and the governing policy&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>statements—require the conclusion that the district court&para;<br>has authority to entertain §3582(c)(2) motions when sen&para;<br>tences are imposed in light of the Guidelines, even if the&para;<br>defendant enters into an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The transcript of petitioner’s sentencing hearing reveals&para;<br>that his original sentence was based on the Guidelines.&para;<br>The District Court first calculated the sentencing range,&para;<br>as both §3553(a)(4) and §6B1.2(c) require. App. 47a, 49a.&para;<br>It explained that it “considered the advisory guidelines&para;<br>and 18 USC 3553(a),” and that “the sentence imposed . . .&para;<br>fall[s] within the guideline rang[e] and [is] sufficient to&para;<br>meet the objectives of the law.” Id., at 48a–49a. Apart&para;<br>from the defense attorney’s initial statement that the case&para;<br>involved a “(C) plea,” id., at 47a, the hearing proceeded as&para;<br>if the agreement did not exist. The court expressed its&para;<br>independent judgment that the sentence was appropriate&para;<br>in light of the applicable Guidelines range, and its decision&para;<br>was therefore “based on” that range.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The Government asks this Court to hold that sentences&para;<br>like petitioner’s, which follow an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement,&para;<br>are based only on the agreement and not the Guidelines,&para;<br>and therefore that defendants so sentenced are ineligible&para;<br>for §3582(c)(2) relief. The Government’s position rests in&para;<br>part on the concern that the conclusion reached here will&para;<br>upset the bargain struck between prosecutor and defen&para;<br>dant. See Brief for United States 42–43. That, however,&para;<br>has nothing to do with whether a sentence is “based on”&para;<br>the Guidelines under §3582(c)(2). And in any event, the&para;<br>concern is overstated. Retroactive reductions to sentenc&para;<br>ing ranges are infrequent, so the problem will not arise&para;<br>often.

This only makes sense; plea bargain&para;<br>ing necessarily occurs in the shadow of the sentencing&para;<br>scheme to which the defendant would otherwise be sub&para;<br>ject. See United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 255&para;<br>(2005) (“[P]lea bargaining takes place in the shadow of . . .&para;<br>a potential trial” (emphasis deleted)).&para;<br>The term of imprisonment imposed by the district court,&para;<br>however, is not “based on” those background negotiations; instead, as explained above, it is based on the binding&para;<br>agreement produced by those negotiations. I therefore&para;<br>cannot agree with Freeman that §3582(c)(2) calls upon&para;<br>district courts to engage in a free-ranging search through&para;<br>the parties’ negotiating history in search of a Guidelines&para;<br>sentencing range that might have been relevant to the&para;<br>agreement or the court’s acceptance of it. Nor can I agree&para;<br>with the plurality that the district judge’s calculation of&para;<br>the Guidelines provides the basis for the term of impris&para;<br>onment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement.&para;<br>II&para;<br>These conclusions, however, do not mean that a term of&para;<br>imprisonment imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement can&para;<br>never be reduced under §3582(c)(2), as the Government&para;<br>contends. For example, Rule 11(c)(1)(C) allows the parties&para;<br>to “agree that a specific . . . sentencing range is the appro&para;<br>priate disposition of the case.” In delineating the agreed&para;<br>upon term of imprisonment, some (C) agreements may&para;<br>call for the defendant to be sentenced within a particular&para;<br>Guidelines sentencing range. In such cases, the district&para;<br>court’s acceptance of the agreement obligates the court to&para;<br>sentence the defendant accordingly, and there can be no&para;<br>doubt that the term of imprisonment the court imposes is&para;<br>“based on” the agreed-upon sentencing range within the&para;<br>meaning of §3582(c)(2). If that Guidelines range is sub&para;<br>sequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, the de&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>fendant is eligible for sentence reduction.&para;<br>Similarly, a plea agreement might provide for a specific&para;<br>term of imprisonment—such as a number of months—but&para;<br>also make clear that the basis for the specified term is&para;<br>a Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the offense&para;<br>to which the defendant pleaded guilty. As long as that&para;<br>sentencing range is evident from the agreement itself, for&para;<br>purposes of §3582(c)(2) the term of imprisonment imposed&para;<br>by the court in accordance with that agreement is “based&para;<br>on” that range. Therefore, when a (C) agreement ex&para;<br>pressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range to establish&para;<br>the term of imprisonment, and that range is subsequently&para;<br>lowered by the Commission, the defendant is eligible for&para;<br>sentence reduction under §3582(c)(2).2&para;<br>In so holding, I necessarily reject the categorical rule&para;<br>advanced by the Government and endorsed by the dissent,&para;<br>which artificially divorces a (C) agreement from its ex&para;<br>press terms.3 Because the very purpose of a (C) agreement&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent suggests that this rule results from a “mistaken shift in&para;<br>analysis” in this opinion from the actions of the judge to the intent of&para;<br>the parties. See post, at 4 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). The purpose of a&para;<br>(C) agreement, however, is to bind the sentencing court to the terms&para;<br>agreed upon by the parties. See supra, at 3–4. Therefore, to determine&para;<br>whether a sentence imposed pursuant to a (C) agreement was “based&para;<br>on” a Guidelines sentencing range, the reviewing court must necessar&para;<br>ily look to the agreement itself.&para;<br>3 The majority of the Courts of Appeals to have addressed this ques&para;<br>tion have taken approaches consistent with the one I take today. See&para;<br>United States v. Rivera-Martínez, 607 F. 3d 283, 286–287 (CA1 2010);&para;<br>United States v. Ray, 598 F. 3d 407, 409–410 (CA7 2010); United States&para;<br>v.

It appears that only the Third Circuit&para;<br>has applied the absolute rule advanced by the Government. See United&para;<br>States v. Sanchez, 562 F. 3d 275, 282, and n. 8 (2009). As noted by the&para;<br>plurality, see ante, at 1, even the Sixth Circuit allows for sentence&para;<br>reduction “to avoid a miscarriage of justice or to correct a mutual&para;<br>mistake,” United States v. Peveler, 359 F. 3d 369, 378, n. 4 (2004) (in&para;<br>ternal quotation marks omitted).

When a (C) agree&para;<br>ment explicitly employs a particular Guidelines sentenc&para;<br>ing range to establish the term of imprisonment, the&para;<br>agreement itself demonstrates the parties’ intent that&para;<br>the imposed term of imprisonment will be based on that&para;<br>range, as required for sentence reduction under the stat&para;<br>ute.5&para;<br>The Government’s concern that application of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Freeman.

See post, at 4–5 (citing USSG&para;<br>§1B1.10(b)(1) (Nov. 2010)). But in so arguing, the dissent—like the&para;<br>Government—would have courts ignore the agreement’s express terms,&para;<br>which the court “applie[s]” when imposing the term of imprisonment.&para;<br>5 The plurality asserts that “[t]here is no good reason to extend the&para;<br>benefit [of sentence reduction] only to an arbitrary subset of defendants&para;<br>. . . based on whether their plea agreements refer to the Guidelines.”&para;<br>Ante, at 10. But the “good reason” is evident: Rule 11(c)(1)(C)’s entire&para;<br>purpose is to allow the parties’ intent to determine sentencing out&para;<br>comes. See supra, at 3–4. If a (C) agreement does not indicate the&para;<br>parties’ intent to base the term of imprisonment on a particular Guide&para;<br>lines range subsequently lowered by the Commission, then §3582(c)(2)&para;<br>simply does not apply.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FREEMAN v.

Free&para;<br>man’s agreement does.&para;<br>The agreement states that Freeman “agrees to have his&para;<br>sentence determined pursuant to the Sentencing Guide&para;<br>lines,” App. 28a, and that 106 months is the total term of&para;<br>imprisonment to be imposed, id., at 26a. The agreement&para;<br>also makes clear that the §924(c)(1)(A) count to which&para;<br>Freeman agrees to plead guilty carries a minimum sen&para;<br>tence of 60 months, “which must be served consecutively&para;<br>to” any other sentence imposed. Id., at 27a. This leaves&para;<br>46 months unaccounted for. The agreement sets Free&para;<br>man’s offense level at 19, as determined by the quantity of&para;<br>drugs and his acceptance of responsibility, and states that&para;<br>the parties anticipate a criminal history category of IV.&para;<br>Id., at 27a–28a.

A (sentencing table). Therefore, contrary&para;<br>to the dissent’s curious suggestion that “there is no way&para;<br>of knowing what th[e] sentence was ‘based on,’ ” post, at 6,&para;<br>it is evident that Freeman’s agreement employed the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Because it is the parties’ agreement that controls in the (C) agree&para;<br>ment context, see supra, at 3–4, even if the District Court had calcu&para;<br>lated the range differently than the parties, see post, at 8 (ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

In this case, Freeman executed a written plea&para;<br>agreement in which the parties “agree[d] that a sentence&para;<br>of 106 months’ incarceration [was] the appropriate disposi­&para;<br>tion.” App. 26a. Because the plea agreement was entered&para;<br>pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C), that proposed sentence be­&para;<br>came binding on the District Court once it accepted the&para;<br>agreement. See Fed.

As a result,&para;<br>when determining the sentence to impose on Freeman, the&para;<br>District Court needed to consult one thing and one thing&para;<br>only—the plea agreement. See ante, at 2 (opinion of&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J.)

This&para;<br>exception is in my view as mistaken as the position of the&para;<br>plurality—and basically for the same reasons.&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR begins the departure from her&para;<br>own rule innocently enough. As she explains, “some (C)&para;<br>agreements may call for the defendant to be sentenced&para;<br>within a particular Guidelines sentencing range.” Ante, at&para;<br>5. In such a case, according to JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, there&para;<br>can be “no doubt” that the prison term the court imposes is&para;<br>“based on” the agreed-upon sentencing range, and there­&para;<br>fore the defendant is eligible for sentence reduction. Ibid.&para;<br>Whether or not that is true, it provides no support for&para;<br>the next step:&para;<br>“Similarly, a plea agreement might provide for a&para;<br>specific term of imprisonment—such as a number of&para;<br>months—but also make clear that the basis for the&para;<br>specified term is a Guidelines sentencing range appli­&para;<br>cable to the offense to which the defendant pleaded&para;<br>guilty.

It is quite another to&para;<br>conclude that an agreement providing for a specific term is&para;<br>“similarly” based on a Guidelines range, simply because&para;<br>the specified term can be said to reflect that range.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FREEMAN v.

If, however, the agreement sets forth a&para;<br>specific term but it is somehow “clear that the basis for the&para;<br>specified term is a Guidelines sentencing range,” then the&para;<br>defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction. Ante, at 6.&para;<br>This head-scratching distinction between negotiating by&para;<br>reference to the Guidelines and using them as a basis for&para;<br>the specified term makes for an unworkable test that can&para;<br>yield only arbitrary results.&para;<br>The confusion is compounded by the varying standards&para;<br>in the concurrence. Sometimes the test is whether an&para;<br>agreement “expressly uses” a Guidelines sentencing range,&para;<br>ante, at 1, 6; see ante, at 7 (“explicitly employs”). Other&para;<br>times the test is whether such use is “evident,” ante, at 6,&para;<br>9; see ante, at 10, n. 9 (“clear”). A third option is whether&para;<br>the agreement “indicate[s] the parties’ intent to base the&para;<br>term of imprisonment on a particular Guideline range.”&para;<br>Ante, at 7, n. 5 (emphasis added).&para;<br>The error in the concurring opinion is largely attribut­&para;<br>able to a mistaken shift in analysis. In the first half of the&para;<br>opinion, the inquiry properly looks to what the judge does:&para;<br>He is, after all, the one who imposes the sentence. After&para;<br>approving the agreement, the judge considers only the&para;<br>fixed term in the agreement, so the sentence he actually&para;<br>imposes is not “based on” the Guidelines.&para;<br>In the second half of the opinion, however, the analysis&para;<br>suddenly shifts, and focuses on the parties: Did they “use”&para;<br>or “employ” the Guidelines in arriving at the term in their&para;<br>agreement?&para;<br>But §3582(c)(2) is concerned only with&para;<br>whether a defendant “has been sentenced to a term of&para;<br>imprisonment based on a sentencing range.” Only a court&para;<br>can sentence a defendant, so there is no basis for examin­&para;<br>ing why the parties settled on a particular prison term.&para;<br>This conclusion dovetails with USSG §1B1.10(b)(1)—&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

United States,&para;<br>560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9). According to&para;<br>§1B1.10(b)(1), the court must first determine “the&para;<br>amended guideline range that would have been applicable&para;<br>to the defendant” if the retroactively amended provision&para;<br>had been in effect at the time of his sentencing. “In mak­&para;<br>ing such determination, the court shall substitute only&para;<br>the amendments . . . for the corresponding guideline pro­&para;<br>visions that were applied when the defendant was sen&para;<br>tenced.” USSG §1B1.10(b)(1), p. s. (emphasis added).&para;<br>As noted, the District Court sentenced Freeman pursu­&para;<br>ant to the term specified by his plea agreement; it never&para;<br>“applied” a Guidelines provision in imposing his term of&para;<br>imprisonment. The fact that the court may have “use[d]&para;<br>the Guidelines as a yardstick in deciding whether to ac­&para;<br>cept a (C) agreement does not mean that the term of im­&para;<br>prisonment imposed by the court is ‘based on’ a particular&para;<br>Guidelines sentencing range.” Ante, at 2–3 (opinion of&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J.). Even if the Guidelines were “used” or&para;<br>“employed” by the parties in arriving at the Rule&para;<br>11(c)(1)(C) sentencing term, they were not “applied when&para;<br>the defendant was sentenced.” Once the District Court&para;<br>accepted the agreement, all that was later “applied” was&para;<br>the sentence set forth in that agreement.&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR is wrong to assert that her stan­&para;<br>dard “does not rewrite the plea agreement” but rather&para;<br>“enforces the agreement’s terms.” Ante, at 7. According to&para;<br>the concurrence, “[w]hen a (C) agreement explicitly em­&para;<br>ploys a particular Guidelines sentencing range to establish&para;<br>the term of imprisonment, the agreement itself demon­&para;<br>strates the parties’ intent that the imposed term of im­&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>FREEMAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>prisonment will be based on that range,” and therefore&para;<br>subject to reduction if the Commission subsequently low­&para;<br>ers that range. Ibid. In this case, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR&para;<br>concludes that Freeman’s agreement contemplated such a&para;<br>reduction, even though the parties had “agree[d] that a&para;<br>sentence of 106 months’ incarceration is the appropriate&para;<br>disposition of this case.” App. 26a.&para;<br>There is, however, no indication whatever that the par­&para;<br>ties to the agreement contemplated the prospect of low­&para;<br>ered sentencing ranges. And it is fanciful to suppose that&para;<br>the parties would have said “106 months” if what they&para;<br>really meant was “a sentence at the lowest end of the&para;<br>applicable Guidelines range.” Cf. App. 25a (parties in this&para;<br>case recommending “a fine at the lowest end of the appli­&para;<br>cable Guideline Range”). In concluding otherwise, the&para;<br>concurrence “ignore[s] the agreement’s express terms.”&para;<br>Ante, at 7, n. 4.&para;<br>The reality is that whenever the parties choose a fixed&para;<br>term, there is no way of knowing what that sentence was&para;<br>“based on.” The prosecutor and the defendant could well&para;<br>have had quite different reasons for concluding that 106&para;<br>months was a good deal. Perhaps the prosecutor wanted&para;<br>to devote the limited resources of his office to a different&para;<br>area of criminal activity, rather than try this case. Per­&para;<br>haps the defendant had reason to question the credibility&para;<br>of one of his key witnesses, and feared a longer sentence if&para;<br>the case went to trial.&para;<br>Indeed, the fact that there may be uncertainty about&para;<br>how to calculate the appropriate Guidelines range could be&para;<br>the basis for agreement on a fixed term in a plea under&para;<br>Rule 11(c)(1)(C). Here the agreement made clear that&para;<br>there was some doubt about the Guidelines calculations.&para;<br>See App. 28a (“Both parties reserve the right to object to&para;<br>the USSG §4A1.1 calculation of defendant’s criminal&para;<br>history”); ibid.

Surely not. The concurrence tacitly concedes as&para;<br>much when it suggests that an agreement to “drop[ ] a&para;<br>charge or forgo[ ] a future charge” could ultimately be&para;<br>grounds for not reducing the defendant’s sentence.

But what this really shows is a basic flaw in the&para;<br>“based on” test adopted by that opinion.&para;<br>Finally, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s approach will foster con­&para;<br>fusion in an area in need of clarity.

In this case, what if the term&para;<br>was 53 months—exactly half the low end of the sentencing&para;<br>range anticipated by the parties?

Is a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) sentence still subject to&para;<br>reduction if the parties relied on the wrong sentencing&para;<br>range? JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s surprising answer is “yes,”&para;<br>see ante, at 9, n. 8, even though the governing Guide­&para;<br>lines provision specifies that a defendant is only eligible&para;<br>for sentence reduction if the amended Guideline has “the&para;<br>effect of lowering the defendant’s applicable guideline&para;<br>range”—presumably the correct applicable guideline&para;<br>range. See USSG §1B1.10(a)(2), p. s.
