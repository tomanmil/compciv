KEBODEAUX&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–418.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued April 17, 2013—Decided June 24, 2013&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent Kebodeaux was convicted by a special court-martial of a&para;<br>federal sex offense. After serving his sentence and receiving a bad&para;<br>conduct discharge from the Air Force, he moved to Texas where he&para;<br>registered with state authorities as a sex offender. Congress subsequently enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act&para;<br>(SORNA), which requires federal sex offenders to register in the&para;<br>States where they live, study, and work, 42 U. S. C. §16913(a), and&para;<br>which applies to offenders who, when SORNA became law, had already completed their sentences, 28 CFR §72.3. When Kebodeaux&para;<br>moved within Texas and failed to update his registration, the Federal&para;<br>Government prosecuted him under SORNA, and the District Court&para;<br>convicted him. The Fifth Circuit reversed, noting that, at the time of&para;<br>SORNA’s enactment, Kebodeaux had served his sentence and was no&para;<br>longer in any special relationship with the Federal Government. Believing that Kebodeaux was not required to register under the preSORNA Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, the court found that he had been “unconditionally” freed. That being so, the court held, the Federal Government lacked the power under Article I’s Necessary and Proper&para;<br>Clause to regulate his intrastate movements.&para;<br>Held: SORNA’s registration requirements as applied to Kebodeaux fall&para;<br>within the scope of Congress’ authority under the Necessary and&para;<br>Proper Clause. Pp. 3–12.&para;<br>(a) Contrary to the Fifth Circuit’s critical assumption that Kebodeaux’s release was unconditional, a full reading of the relevant&para;<br>statutes and regulations makes clear that at the time of his offense&para;<br>and conviction he was subject to the Wetterling Act, which imposed&para;<br>upon him registration requirements very similar to SORNA’s. See,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>e.g., 42 U. S. C. §§14072(i)(3)–(4). The fact that these federal-law requirements in part involved compliance with state-law requirements&para;<br>made them no less requirements of federal law. See generally United&para;<br>States v. Sharpnack, 355 U. S. 286, 293–294. Pp. 3–6.&para;<br>(b) Congress promulgated the Wetterling Act under authority&para;<br>granted by the Military Regulation Clause, Art. I, §8, cl. 14, and the&para;<br>Necessary and Proper Clause. The same power that authorized Congress to promulgate the Uniform Code of Military Justice and punish&para;<br>Kebodeaux’s crime also authorized Congress to make the civil registration requirement at issue here a consequence of his conviction.&para;<br>And its decision to impose a civil registration requirement that would&para;<br>apply upon the release of an offender like Kebodeaux is eminently&para;<br>reasonable. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 102–103. It was also entirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned a special role to the&para;<br>Federal Government in ensuring compliance with federal sex offender registration requirements. See Carr v. United States, 560 U. S.&para;<br>438, ___. Thus, Congress did not apply SORNA to an individual who&para;<br>had, prior to its enactment, been “unconditionally released,” but rather to an individual already subject to federal registration requirements enacted pursuant to the Military Regulation and Necessary&para;<br>and Proper Clauses. SORNA somewhat modified the applicable registration requirements to which Kebodeaux was already subject, in&para;<br>order to make more uniform what had remained “a patchwork of federal and 50 individual state registration requirements,” Reynolds v.&para;<br>United States, 565 U. S. ___, ___. No one here claims that these&para;<br>changes are unreasonable or that Congress could not reasonably have&para;<br>found them “necessary and proper” means for furthering its preexisting registration ends.

ANTHONY JAMES&para;<br>KEBODEAUX&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>[June 24, 2013]&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>In 1999 a special court-martial convicted Anthony Kebodeaux, a member of the United States Air Force, of a sex&para;<br>offense. It imposed a sentence of three months’ imprisonment and a bad conduct discharge. In 2006, several years&para;<br>after Kebodeaux had served his sentence and been discharged, Congress enacted the Sex Offender Registration&para;<br>and Notification Act (SORNA), 120 Stat. 590, 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§16901 et seq., a federal statute that requires those convicted of federal sex offenses to register in the States&para;<br>where they live, study, and work. §16913(a); 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2250(a). And, by regulation, the Federal Government&para;<br>made clear that SORNA’s registration requirements apply to federal sex offenders who, when SORNA became&para;<br>law, had already completed their sentences. 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§16913(d) (Attorney General’s authority to issue regulations); 28 CFR §72.3 (2012) (regulation specifying application to pre-SORNA offenders).&para;<br>We here must decide whether the Constitution’s Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power to&para;<br>enact SORNA’s registration requirements and apply them&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to a federal offender who had completed his sentence prior&para;<br>to the time of SORNA’s enactment. For purposes of answering this question, we assume that Congress has complied with the Constitution’s Ex Post Facto and Due&para;<br>Process Clauses. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 105–106&para;<br>(2003) (upholding a similar Alaska statute against ex post&para;<br>facto challenge); Supp. Brief for Kebodeaux on Rehearing&para;<br>En Banc in No. 08–51185 (CA5) (not raising any Due&para;<br>Process challenge); Brief for Respondent (same). We&para;<br>conclude that the Necessary and Proper Clause grants&para;<br>Congress adequate power to enact SORNA and to apply&para;<br>it here.&para;<br>I&para;<br>As we have just said, in 1999 a special court-martial&para;<br>convicted Kebodeaux, then a member of the Air Force, of a&para;<br>federal sex offense. He served his 3-month sentence; the&para;<br>Air Force released him with a bad conduct discharge. And&para;<br>then he moved to Texas. In 2004 Kebodeaux registered&para;<br>as a sex offender with Texas state authorities. Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 6–7. In 2006 Congress enacted SORNA. In&para;<br>2007 Kebodeaux moved within Texas from San Antonio to&para;<br>El Paso, updating his sex offender registration. App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 167a–168a. But later that year he returned&para;<br>to San Antonio without making the legally required sexoffender registration changes. Id., at 169a. And the Federal Government, acting under SORNA, prosecuted&para;<br>Kebodeaux for this last-mentioned SORNA registration&para;<br>failure.&para;<br>A Federal District Court convicted Kebodeaux of having&para;<br>violated SORNA. See 687 F. 3d 232, 234 (CA5 2012) (en&para;<br>banc). On appeal a panel of the United States Court of&para;<br>Appeals for the Fifth Circuit initially upheld the conviction. 647 F. 3d 137 (2011) (per curiam). But the Circuit&para;<br>then heard the appeal en banc and, by a vote of 10 to 6,&para;<br>reversed. 687 F. 3d, at 234. The court stated that, by the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>time Congress enacted SORNA, Kebodeaux had “fully&para;<br>served” his sex-offense sentence; he was “no longer in&para;<br>federal custody, in the military, under any sort of supervised release or parole, or in any other special relationship&para;<br>with the federal government.” Ibid.&para;<br>The court recognized that, even before SORNA, federal&para;<br>law required certain federal sex offenders to register. Id.,&para;<br>at 235, n. 4. See Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act,&para;<br>§170101, 108 Stat. 2038–2042. But it believed that&para;<br>the pre-SORNA federal registration requirements did not&para;<br>apply to Kebodeaux. 687 F. 3d, at 235, n. 4. Hence, in the&para;<br>Circuit’s view, Kebodeaux had been “unconditionally let&para;<br>. . . free.” Id., at 234. And, that being so, the Federal&para;<br>Government lacked the power under Article I’s Necessary&para;<br>and Proper Clause to regulate through registration Kebodeaux’s intrastate movements. Id., at 234–235. In&para;<br>particular, the court said that after “the federal government has unconditionally let a person free . . . the fact&para;<br>that he once committed a crime is not a jurisdictional&para;<br>basis for subsequent regulation and possible criminal&para;<br>prosecution.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Solicitor General sought certiorari. And, in light of&para;<br>the fact that a Federal Court of Appeals has held a federal&para;<br>statute unconstitutional, we granted the petition. See,&para;<br>e.g., United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 605 (2000);&para;<br>United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U. S. 418, 425&para;<br>(1993).&para;<br>II&para;<br>We do not agree with the Circuit’s conclusion. And, in&para;<br>explaining our reasons, we need not go much further than&para;<br>the Circuit’s critical assumption that Kebodeaux’s release&para;<br>was “unconditional,” i.e., that after Kebodeaux’s release,&para;<br>he was not in “any . . . special relationship with the federal government.” 687 F. 3d, at 234. To the contrary, the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Solicitor General, tracing through a complex set of statutory cross-references, has pointed out that at the time of&para;<br>his offense and conviction Kebodeaux was subject to the&para;<br>federal Wetterling Act, an Act that imposed upon him&para;<br>registration requirements very similar to those that&para;<br>SORNA later mandated. Brief for United States 18–29.&para;<br>Congress enacted the Wetterling Act in 1994 and updated it several times prior to Kebodeaux’s offense. Like&para;<br>SORNA, it used the federal spending power to encourage&para;<br>States to adopt sex offender registration laws. 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§14071(i) (2000 ed.); Smith, supra, at 89–90.&para;<br>Like&para;<br>SORNA, it applied to those who committed federal sex&para;<br>crimes. §14071(b)(7)(A). And like SORNA, it imposed&para;<br>federal penalties upon federal sex offenders who failed to&para;<br>register in the States in which they lived, worked, and&para;<br>studied. §§14072(i)(3)–(4).&para;<br>In particular, §14072(i)(3) imposed federal criminal&para;<br>penalties upon any “person who is . . . described in section&para;<br>4042(c)(4) of title 18, and knowingly fails to register in any&para;<br>State in which the person resides.” The cross-referenced&para;<br>§4042(c)(4) said that a “person is described in this paragraph if the person was convicted of ” certain enumerated&para;<br>offenses or “[a]ny other offense designated by the Attorney&para;<br>General as a sexual offense for purposes of this subsection.” 18 U. S. C. §4042(c)(4). In 1998 the Attorney General “delegated this authority [to designate sex offenses] to&para;<br>the Director of the Bureau of Prisons.” Dept. of Justice,&para;<br>Bureau of Prisons, Designation of Offenses Subject to Sex&para;<br>Offender Release Notification, 63 Fed. Reg. 69386. And&para;<br>that same year the Director of the Bureau of Prisons&para;<br>“designate[d]” the offense of which Kebodeaux was convicted, namely the military offense of “carnal knowledge”&para;<br>as set forth in Article 120(B) of the Code of Military Justice. Id., at 69387 See 28 CFR §571.72(b)(2) (1999). A full&para;<br>reading of these documents makes clear that, contrary&para;<br>to Kebodeaux’s contention, the relevant penalty applied to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>crimes committed by military personnel.&para;<br>Moreover, a different Wetterling Act section imposed&para;<br>federal criminal penalties upon any “person who is . . .&para;<br>sentenced by a court martial for conduct in a category&para;<br>specified by the Secretary of Defense under section&para;<br>115(a)(8)(C) of title I of Public Law 105–119, and knowingly fails to register in any State in which the person&para;<br>resides.” 42 U. S. C. §14072(i)(4) (2000 ed.). The crossreferenced section, §115(a)(8)(C), said that the “Secretary&para;<br>of Defense shall specify categories of conduct punishable&para;<br>under the Uniform Code of Military Justice which encompass a range of conduct comparable to that described in&para;<br>[certain provisions of the Violent Crime Control and Law&para;<br>Enforcement Act of 1994], and such other conduct as the&para;<br>Secretary deems appropriate.” 1998 Appropriations Act,&para;<br>§115(a)(8)(C)(i), 111 Stat. 2466. See note following 10&para;<br>U. S. C. §951 (2000 ed.). The Secretary had delegated&para;<br>certain types of authority, such as this last mentioned&para;<br>“deem[ing]” authority, to an Assistant Secretary of Defense. DoD Directive 5124.5, p. 4 (Oct. 31, 1994). And in&para;<br>December 1998 an Assistant Secretary, acting pursuant to&para;<br>this authority, published a list of military crimes that&para;<br>included the crime of which Kebodeaux was convicted,&para;<br>namely Article 120(B) of the Uniform Code of Military&para;<br>Justice. App. to Pet. for Cert. 171a–175a. The provision&para;<br>added that “[c]onvictions . . . shall trigger requirements&para;<br>to notify state and local law enforcement agencies and to&para;<br>provide information to inmates concerning sex offender&para;<br>registration requirements.” Id., at 175a. And, the provision says (contrary to Kebodeaux’s reading, Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 57), that it shall “take effect immediately.”&para;<br>It contains no expiration date. App. to Pet. for Cert. 175a.&para;<br>We are not aware of any plausible counterargument to&para;<br>the obvious conclusion, namely that as of the time of Kebodeaux’s offense, conviction and release from federal&para;<br>custody, these Wetterling Act provisions applied to Kebo-&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>deaux and imposed upon him registration requirements&para;<br>very similar to those that SORNA later imposed. Contrary to what the Court of Appeals may have believed, the&para;<br>fact that the federal law’s requirements in part involved&para;<br>compliance with state-law requirements made them no&para;<br>less requirements of federal law. See generally United&para;<br>States v. Sharpnack, 355 U. S. 286, 293–294 (1958) (Congress has the power to adopt as federal law the laws of a&para;<br>State and to apply them in federal enclaves); Gibbons v.&para;<br>Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 207–208 (1824) (“Although Congress&para;<br>cannot enable a State to legislate, Congress may adopt the&para;<br>provisions of a State on any subject. . . . The act [adopts&para;<br>state systems for regulation of pilots] and gives [them] the&para;<br>same validity as if its provisions had been specially made&para;<br>by Congress”).&para;<br>III&para;<br>Both the Court of Appeals and Kebodeaux come close to&para;<br>conceding that if, as of the time of Kebodeaux’s offense,&para;<br>he was subject to a federal registration requirement, then&para;<br>the Necessary and Proper Clause authorized Congress to&para;<br>modify the requirement as in SORNA and to apply the&para;<br>modified requirement to Kebodeaux. See 687 F. 3d, at&para;<br>234–235, and n. 4; Tr. of Oral Arg. 38–39. And we believe&para;<br>they would be right to make this concession.&para;<br>No one here claims that the Wetterling Act, as applied&para;<br>to military sex offenders like Kebodeaux, falls outside the&para;<br>scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause. And it is&para;<br>difficult to see how anyone could persuasively do so. The&para;<br>Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to&para;<br>“make Rules for the . . . Regulation of the land and naval&para;<br>Forces.” Art. I, §8, cl. 14. And, in the Necessary and&para;<br>Proper Clause itself, it grants Congress the power to&para;<br>“make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for&para;<br>carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers” and “all&para;<br>other Powers” that the Constitution vests “in the Govern-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ment of the United States, or in any Department or Officer&para;<br>thereof.” Id., cl. 18.&para;<br>The scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause is broad.&para;<br>In words that have come to define that scope Chief Justice&para;<br>Marshall long ago wrote:&para;<br>“Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of&para;<br>the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,&para;<br>which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not&para;<br>prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the&para;<br>constitution, are constitutional.” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819).&para;<br>As we have come to understand these words and the&para;<br>provision they explain, they “leav[e] to Congress a large&para;<br>discretion as to the means that may be employed in executing a given power.” Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 355&para;<br>(1903). See Morrison, 529 U. S., at 607. The Clause allows Congress to “adopt any means, appearing to it most&para;<br>eligible and appropriate, which are adapted to the end to&para;<br>be accomplished and consistent with the letter and spirit&para;<br>of the Constitution.” James Everard’s Breweries v. Day,&para;<br>265 U. S. 545, 559 (1924).&para;<br>The Constitution, for example, makes few explicit references to federal criminal law, but the Necessary and&para;<br>Proper Clause nonetheless authorizes Congress, in the implementation of other explicit powers, to create federal&para;<br>crimes, to confine offenders to prison, to hire guards and&para;<br>other prison personnel, to provide prisoners with medical&para;<br>care and educational training, to ensure the safety of those&para;<br>who may come into contact with prisoners, to ensure the&para;<br>public’s safety through systems of parole and supervised&para;<br>release, and, where a federal prisoner’s mental condition&para;<br>so requires, to confine that prisoner civilly after the expiration of his or her term of imprisonment. See United&para;<br>States v. Comstock, 560 U. S. 126, 136–137 (2010).&para;<br>Here, under the authority granted to it by the Military&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Regulation and Necessary and Proper Clauses, Congress&para;<br>could promulgate the Uniform Code of Military Justice. It&para;<br>could specify that the sex offense of which Kebodeaux was&para;<br>convicted was a military crime under that Code. It could&para;<br>punish that crime through imprisonment and by placing&para;<br>conditions upon Kebodeaux’s release. And it could make&para;<br>the civil registration requirement at issue here a consequence of Kebodeaux’s offense and conviction. This civil&para;<br>requirement, while not a specific condition of Kebodeaux’s&para;<br>release, was in place at the time Kebodeaux committed his&para;<br>offense, and was a consequence of his violation of federal&para;<br>law.&para;<br>And Congress’ decision to impose such a civil requirement that would apply upon the release of an offender like&para;<br>Kebodeaux is eminently reasonable. Congress could reasonably conclude that registration requirements applied to&para;<br>federal sex offenders after their release can help protect&para;<br>the public from those federal sex offenders and alleviate&para;<br>public safety concerns. See Smith, 538 U. S., at 102–103&para;<br>(sex offender registration has “a legitimate nonpunitive&para;<br>purpose of ‘public safety, which is advanced by alerting the&para;<br>public to the risk of sex offenders in their community’ ”).&para;<br>There is evidence that recidivism rates among sex offenders are higher than the average for other types of criminals. See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,&para;<br>P. Langan, E. Schmitt, &amp; M. Durose, Recidivism of Sex&para;<br>Offenders Released in 1994, p. 1 (Nov. 2003) (reporting&para;<br>that compared to non-sex offenders, released sex offenders&para;<br>were four times more likely to be rearrested for a sex&para;<br>crime, and that within the first three years following&para;<br>release 5.3% of released sex offenders were rearrested for&para;<br>a sex crime). There is also conflicting evidence on the&para;<br>point. Cf. R. Tewsbury, W. Jennings, &amp; K. Zgoba, Final&para;<br>Report on Sex Offenders: Recidivism and Collateral Consequences (Sept. 2011) (concluding that sex offenders have&para;<br>relatively low rates of recidivism, and that registration&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>requirements have limited observable benefits regarding&para;<br>recidivism). But the Clause gives Congress the power to&para;<br>weigh the evidence and to reach a rational conclusion, for&para;<br>example, that safety needs justify postrelease registration&para;<br>rules. See Lambert v. Yellowley, 272 U. S. 581, 594–&para;<br>595 (1926) (upholding congressional statute limiting the&para;<br>amount of spirituous liquor that may be prescribed by&para;<br>a physician, and noting that Congress’ “finding [regarding the appropriate amount], in the presence of the wellknown diverging opinions of physicians, cannot be regarded&para;<br>as arbitrary or without a reasonable basis”). See also&para;<br>Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 22 (2005) (“In assessing the&para;<br>scope of Congress’ authority under the Commerce Clause,&para;<br>we stress that the task before us is a modest one. We need&para;<br>not determine whether respondents’ activities, taken in the&para;<br>aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce in&para;<br>fact, but only whether a ‘rational basis’ exists for so concluding”). See also H. R. Rep. No. 109–218, pt. 1, pp. 22,&para;<br>23 (2005) (House Report) (citing statistics compiled by the&para;<br>Justice Department as support for SORNA’s sex offender&para;<br>registration regime).&para;<br>At the same time, “it is entirely reasonable for Congress&para;<br>to have assigned the Federal Government a special role in&para;<br>ensuring compliance with SORNA’s registration requirements by federal sex offenders—persons who typically&para;<br>would have spent time under federal criminal supervision.” Carr v. United States, 560 U. S. 438, ___ (2010) (slip&para;<br>op., at 12). The Federal Government has long kept track&para;<br>of former federal prisoners through probation, parole, and&para;<br>supervised release in part to prevent further crimes thereby protecting the public against the risk of recidivism. See&para;<br>Parole Act, 36 Stat. 819; Probation Act, ch. 521, 43 Stat.&para;<br>1259; Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, ch. II, 98 Stat. 1987.&para;<br>See also 1 N. Cohen, The Law of Probation and Parole&para;<br>§§7:3, 7:4 (2d ed. 1999) (principal purposes of postrelease&para;<br>conditions are to rehabilitate the convict, thus preventing&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>him from recidivating, and to protect the public). Neither,&para;<br>as of 1994, was registration particularly novel, for by then&para;<br>States had implemented similar requirements for close to&para;<br>half a century. See W. Logan, Knowledge as Power: Criminal Registration and Community Notification Laws in&para;<br>America 30–31 (2009). Moreover, the Wetterling Act took&para;<br>state interests into account by, for the most part, requiring&para;<br>released federal offenders to register in accordance with&para;<br>state law. At the same time, the Wetterling Act’s requirements were reasonably narrow and precise, tying&para;<br>time limits to the type of sex offense, incorporating statelaw details, and relating penalties for violations to the&para;<br>sex crime initially at issue. See 42 U. S. C. §14071(b)&para;<br>(2000 ed.).&para;<br>The upshot is that here Congress did not apply SORNA&para;<br>to an individual who had, prior to SORNA’s enactment,&para;<br>been “unconditionally released,” i.e., a person who was not&para;<br>in “any . . . special relationship with the federal government,” but rather to an individual already subject to federal registration requirements that were themselves a&para;<br>valid exercise of federal power under the Military Regulation and Necessary and Proper Clauses. But cf. post, at 1&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., dissenting).&para;<br>SORNA, enacted after Kebodeaux’s release, somewhat&para;<br>modified the applicable registration requirements. In general, SORNA provided more detailed definitions of sex&para;<br>offenses, described in greater detail the nature of the&para;<br>information registrants must provide, and imposed somewhat different limits upon the length of time that registration must continue and the frequency with which&para;<br>offenders must update their registration. 42 U. S. C. §§16911,&para;<br>16913–16916 (2006 ed. and Supp. V). But the statute, like&para;<br>the Wetterling Act, used Spending Clause grants to encourage States to adopt its uniform definitions and requirements. It did not insist that the States do so. See&para;<br>§§16925(a), (d) (2006 ed.) (“The provisions of this subchap-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

Compare 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §16913(c) with App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a–168a.&para;<br>SORNA also increased the federal penalty for a federal&para;<br>offender’s registration violation to a maximum of 10 years&para;<br>from a maximum of 1 year for a first offense. Compare&para;<br>18 U. S. C. §2250(a) with 42 U. S. C. §14072(i) (2000&para;<br>ed.). Kebodeaux was sentenced to one year and one day&para;<br>of imprisonment. For purposes of federal law, SORNA reduced the duration of Kebodeaux’s registration requirement to 25 years from the lifetime requirement imposed&para;<br>by Texas law, compare 42 U. S. C. §16915(a) (2006 ed.)&para;<br>with App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a, and reduced the frequency&para;<br>with which Kebodeaux must update his registration to&para;<br>every six months from every 90 days as imposed by Texas&para;<br>law, compare 42 U. S. C. §16916(2) with App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 167a. And as far as we can tell, while SORNA punishes violations of its requirements (instead of violations of&para;<br>state law), the Federal Government has prosecuted a sex&para;<br>offender for violating SORNA only when that offender also&para;<br>violated state-registration requirements.&para;<br>SORNA’s general changes were designed to make more&para;<br>uniform what had remained “a patchwork of federal and&para;<br>50 individual state registration systems,” Reynolds v.&para;<br>United States, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 2),&para;<br>with “loopholes and deficiencies” that had resulted in an&para;<br>estimated 100,000 sex offenders becoming “missing” or&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

The majority, having established that premise and thus resolved the case before us,&para;<br>nevertheless goes on to discuss the general public safety&para;<br>benefits of the registration requirement. Ante, at 8–10.&para;<br>Because that analysis is beside the point in this case, I concur in the judgment only.&para;<br>While serving in the Air Force, Kebodeaux violated the&para;<br>Uniform Code of Military Justice by having sexual relations with a minor. A special court-martial convicted him.&para;<br>As relevant here, that conviction had two consequences:&para;<br>First, Kebodeaux was sentenced to confinement for three&para;<br>months. And second, as the majority describes, he was&para;<br>required to register as a sex offender with the State in&para;<br>which he resided and keep that registration current; failure to do so would subject him to federal criminal penalties. Ante, at 4–6.&para;<br>In the same way that Congress undoubtedly had the authority to impose the first consequence for a violation of&para;<br>military rules, it also had the authority to impose the&para;<br>second. The Constitution gives Congress the power “[t]o&para;<br>make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>land and naval Forces.” Art. I, §8, cl. 14. And, under&para;<br>the Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress can give those&para;<br>rules force by imposing consequences on members of the&para;<br>military who disobey them. See McCulloch v. Maryland, 4&para;<br>Wheat. 316, 416 (1819) (“All admit that the government&para;<br>may, legitimately, punish any violation of its laws; and&para;<br>yet, this is not among the enumerated powers of Congress.”). A servicemember will be less likely to violate a&para;<br>relevant military regulation if he knows that, having done&para;<br>so, he will be required to register as a sex offender years&para;<br>into the future.&para;<br>It is this power, the power to regulate the conduct of&para;<br>members of the military by imposing consequences for&para;<br>their violations of military law, that supports application&para;<br>of the federal registration obligation to Kebodeaux. As the&para;<br>Court explains, the Wetterling Act was in force when&para;<br>Kebodeaux committed the original offense, and applied to&para;<br>him as soon as the special court-martial rendered its&para;<br>verdict. See ante, at 5–6. Congress later, in enacting the&para;<br>Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA),&para;<br>modified the registration regime in place under the Wetterling Act. But as applied to Kebodeaux here (the relevant inquiry in this as-applied challenge), those changes&para;<br>were insignificant; their only effect was that Kebodeaux&para;<br>received a day more than he could have received for the&para;<br>same conduct had the Wetterling Act remained in force.&para;<br>See ante, at 11 (describing SORNA’s effect on Kebodeaux’s&para;<br>registration obligations); compare post, at 10, n. 3&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (discussing changes that did not&para;<br>affect Kebodeaux). Whatever other constitutional concerns might attach to such a change, as a question of&para;<br>Article I power it was permissible. Just as the Federal&para;<br>Government may, under the Necessary and Proper&para;<br>Clause, alter the conditions of a federal prisoner’s confinement or adjust the timing and location of drug&para;<br>tests required of a federal convict, so too could it make&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

Ante,&para;<br>at 8, 11–12. But sandwiched between its discussion of the&para;<br>basis for Congress’s power and its discussion of the inconsequential nature of the changes is a discussion of benefits&para;<br>from the registration system. Along with giving force to&para;<br>military regulations, the majority notes, Congress could&para;<br>also have “reasonably conclude[d] that registration requirements . . . help protect the public from . . . federal sex&para;<br>offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.” Ante, at 8.&para;<br>Maybe so, but those consequences of the registration&para;<br>requirement are irrelevant for our purposes. Public safety&para;<br>benefits are neither necessary nor sufficient to a proper&para;<br>exercise of the power to regulate the military. What&para;<br>matters—all that matters—is that Congress could have&para;<br>rationally determined that “mak[ing] the civil registration&para;<br>requirement at issue here a consequence of Kebodeaux’s&para;<br>offense” would give force to the Uniform Code of Military&para;<br>Justice adopted pursuant to Congress’s power to regulate&para;<br>the Armed Forces. Ibid.&para;<br>Ordinarily such surplusage might not warrant a separate writing. Here, however, I worry that incautious&para;<br>readers will think they have found in the majority opinion&para;<br>something they would not find in either the Constitution&para;<br>or any prior decision of ours: a federal police power. The&para;<br>danger of such confusion is heightened by the fact the&para;<br>Solicitor General adopted something very close to the&para;<br>police power argument, contending that “the federal government has greater ties to former federal sex offenders&para;<br>than it does to other members of the general public,” and&para;<br>can therefore impose restrictions on them even years after&para;<br>their unconditional release simply to “serve[ ] . . . publicprotection purposes.” Brief for United States 34–35.&para;<br>I write separately to stress not only that a federal police&para;<br>power is immaterial to the result in this case, but also that&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>such a power could not be material to the result in this&para;<br>case—because it does not exist. See United States v.&para;<br>Morrison, 529 U.

Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 584–585&para;<br>(1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring))).&para;<br>Our resistance to congressional assertions of such a&para;<br>power has deep roots. From the first, we have recognized&para;<br>that “the powers of the government are limited, and that&para;<br>its limits are not to be transcended.” McCulloch, 4&para;<br>Wheat., at 420–421. Thus, while the Necessary and&para;<br>Proper Clause authorizes congressional action “incidental&para;<br>to [an enumerated] power, and conducive to its beneficial&para;<br>exercise,” Chief Justice Marshall was emphatic that no&para;<br>“great substantive and independent power” can be “implied as incidental to other powers, or used as a means of&para;<br>executing them.” Id., at 418, 411; see also Gibbons v.&para;<br>Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 195 (1824) (“The enumeration presupposes something not enumerated”).&para;<br>It is difficult to imagine a clearer example of such a&para;<br>“great substantive and independent power” than the&para;<br>power to “help protect the public . . . and alleviate public safety concerns,” ante, at 8. I find it implausible to&para;<br>suppose—and impossible to support—that the Framers intended to confer such authority by implication rather than&para;<br>expression. A power of that magnitude vested in the&para;<br>Federal Government is not “consist[ent] with the letter&para;<br>and spirit of the constitution,” McCulloch, supra, at 421,&para;<br>and thus not a “proper [means] for carrying into Execution” the enumerated powers of the Federal Government,&para;<br>U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 18. See United States v. Comstock, 560 U.

The connection to&para;<br>the Military Regulation Clause on which the majority&para;<br>relies, ante, at 8, is less attenuated, and the power it&para;<br>produces less substantial, than would be true of a federal&para;<br>police power over prior federal offenders; the power to&para;<br>threaten and impose particular obligations as a result of a&para;<br>violation of military law is not such a “great substantive&para;<br>and independent power” that the Framers’ failure to enumerate it must imply its absence.&para;<br>Nevertheless, I fear that the majority’s discussion of the&para;<br>public-safety benefits of the registration requirement will&para;<br>be mistaken for an endorsement of the Solicitor General’s&para;<br>public-safety basis for the law.

For example, if the servicemember is convicted of a sex offense in a state court, the&para;<br>state court may be required by state law to provide that&para;<br>information to the state registry. See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat.&para;<br>Ann. §16–22–104(1)(a)(I) (2012).

No. 109–218, pt. 1, p. 26&para;<br>(2005) (despite pre-SORNA registration efforts, “[t]he most&para;<br>significant enforcement issue in the sex offender program&para;<br>[was] that over 100,000 sex offenders, or nearly one-fifth&para;<br>in the Nation are ‘missing,’ meaning that they have not&para;<br>complied with sex offender registration requirements”).&para;<br>When a servicemember is convicted by a military tribunal,&para;<br>however, the State has no authority to require that tribunal to notify the state registry, nor does it have the authority to require the officials at a military prison to notify&para;<br>state or local police when the servicemember is released&para;<br>from custody. Because the exercise of military jurisdiction&para;<br>may have this effect—in other words, may create a gap in&para;<br>the laws intended to maximize the registration of sex&para;<br>offenders—it is necessary and proper for Congress to&para;<br>require the registration of members of the military who&para;<br>are convicted of a qualifying sex offense in a military&para;<br>court.

He completed his sentence in September 1999 and&para;<br>was no longer in federal custody or the military when&para;<br>Congress enacted SORNA, which required him to register&para;<br>as a sex offender. In 2007, Kebodeaux failed to update his&para;<br>sex-offender registration within three days of moving from&para;<br>El Paso, Texas, to San Antonio, Texas. He was convicted&para;<br>under §2250(a)(2)(A) in 2008 and sentenced to a year and&para;<br>a day in prison. The question before the Court is whether&para;<br>Congress has power to require Kebodeaux to register as a&para;<br>sex offender and to criminalize his failure to do so.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Constitution creates a Federal Government with&para;<br>limited powers. Congress has no powers except those&para;<br>specified in the Constitution. See Marbury v. Madison,&para;<br>1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803) (Marshall, C. J.) (“The powers of&para;<br>the legislature are defined, and limited; and that those&para;<br>limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>is written”). Thus, “[e]very law enacted by Congress must&para;<br>be based on one or more of its powers enumerated in the&para;<br>Constitution.” United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598,&para;<br>607 (2000).&para;<br>A different default rule applies to the States. As the&para;<br>Tenth Amendment makes clear, the States enjoy all powers that the Constitution does not withhold from them.&para;<br>(“The powers not delegated to the United States by the&para;<br>Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people”) While&para;<br>the powers of Congress are “few and defined,” the powers&para;<br>that “remain in the State governments are numerous and&para;<br>indefinite.” The Federalist No. 45, p. 328 (B. Wright ed.&para;<br>1961) (J. Madison).&para;<br>The Constitution sets forth Congress’ limited powers in&para;<br>Article I. That Article begins by “vest[ing]” in Congress&para;<br>“[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted,” and then enumerates those powers in §8. The final clause of §8, the&para;<br>Necessary and Proper Clause, gives Congress power “[t]o&para;<br>make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for&para;<br>carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other&para;<br>Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government&para;<br>of the United States, or in any Department or Officer&para;<br>thereof.” Art. I, §8, cl. 18. Importantly, the Necessary and&para;<br>Proper Clause is not a freestanding grant of congressional&para;<br>power, but rather an authorization to makes laws that are&para;<br>necessary to execute both the powers vested in Congress&para;<br>by the preceding clauses of §8, and the powers vested in&para;<br>Congress and the other branches by other provisions of the&para;<br>Constitution. See, e.g., Kinsella v. United States ex rel.&para;<br>Singleton, 361 U. S. 234, 247 (1960) (“The [Necessary and&para;<br>Proper Clause] is not itself a grant of power, but a caveat&para;<br>that the Congress possesses all the means necessary to&para;<br>carry out the specifically granted ‘foregoing’ powers of §8&para;<br>‘and all other Powers vested by this Constitution’ ”).&para;<br>In McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), Chief&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Justice Marshall famously set forth the Court’s interpretation of the Necessary and Proper Clause:&para;<br>“Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of&para;<br>the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,&para;<br>which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not&para;<br>prohibited, but consist[ent] with the letter and spirit&para;<br>of the constitution, are constitutional.” Id., at 421.&para;<br>Under this formulation, a federal law is a valid exercise of&para;<br>Congress’ power under the Clause if it satisfies a two-part&para;<br>test. “First, the law must be directed toward a ‘legitimate’&para;<br>end, which McCulloch defines as one ‘within the scope of&para;<br>the [C]onstitution.’ ” United States v. Comstock, 560&para;<br>U. S. 126, 160 (2010) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting 4&para;<br>Wheat., at 421). In other words, the law must be directed&para;<br>at “carrying into Execution” one or more of the powers&para;<br>delegated to the Federal Government by the Constitution.&para;<br>Art. I, §8, cl. 18. “Second, there must be a necessary and&para;<br>proper fit between the ‘means’ (the federal law) and the&para;<br>‘end’ (the enumerated power or powers) it is designed to&para;<br>serve.” Comstock, 560 U. S., at 160 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). “The means Congress selects will be deemed ‘necessary’ if they are ‘appropriate’ and ‘plainly adapted’ to the&para;<br>exercise of an enumerated power, and ‘proper’ if they are&para;<br>not otherwise ‘prohibited’ by the Constitution and not&para;<br>‘[in]consistent’ with its ‘letter and spirit.’ ” Id., at 160–161&para;<br>(quoting Art. I, §8, cl. 18 and McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at&para;<br>421).&para;<br>Both parts of this test are critical. “[N]o matter how&para;<br>‘necessary’ or ‘proper’ an Act of Congress may be to its&para;<br>objective, Congress lacks authority to legislate if the objective is anything other than ‘carrying into Execution’ one or&para;<br>more of the Federal Government’s enumerated powers.”&para;<br>Comstock, supra, at 161 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). As&para;<br>applied to Kebodeaux, SORNA fails this test.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>It is undisputed that no enumerated power in Article I,&para;<br>§8, gives Congress the power to punish sex offenders who&para;<br>fail to register, nor does any other provision in the Constitution vest Congress or the other branches of the Federal&para;<br>Government with such a power. Thus, SORNA is a valid&para;<br>exercise of congressional authority only if it is “necessary&para;<br>and proper for carrying into Execution” one or more of&para;<br>those federal powers enumerated in the Constitution.&para;<br>In the course of this litigation, the Government has&para;<br>argued that Kebodeaux’s conviction under §2250(a)(2)(A)&para;<br>executes Congress’ enumerated powers to spend for the general welfare, Art. I, §8, cl. 1; to regulate interstate commerce, §8, cl. 3; and to regulate the armed forces, §8,&para;<br>cl. 14. But none of these powers justifies applying&para;<br>§2250(a)(2)(A) to Kebodeaux. The Spending Clause argument is a nonstarter. Section 2250(a)(2)(A) does not&para;<br>execute Congress’ spending power because it regulates&para;<br>individuals who have not necessarily received federal funds&para;<br>of any kind. The Government contends that “federal funding and logistical support offered to States for their sexoffender-registration-and-notification programs can be&para;<br>effective only if persons required to register actually do so”&para;<br>and that “Congress may impose penalties on such individuals as a means of achieving that goal.” Brief for United&para;<br>States 52. But we have never held that Congress gains&para;<br>the power to regulate private individuals merely because&para;<br>it provides money to the States in which they reside.&para;<br>Nor does the Commerce Clause—the enumerated power&para;<br>that the Court has construed most broadly—support&para;<br>§2250(a)(2)(A). Under this Court’s precedents, Congress&para;<br>may use its Commerce Clause power to regulate (1) “ ‘the&para;<br>use of the channels of interstate commerce,’ ” (2) “ ‘the&para;<br>instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or&para;<br>things in interstate commerce,’ ” and (3) economic activities that “ ‘substantially affect interstate commerce.’ ”&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v.

Section 2250(a)(2)(A)&para;<br>does not fall within the first two categories because it is&para;<br>not limited to regulating sex offenders who have traveled&para;<br>in interstate commerce. Instead, it applies to all federal&para;<br>sex offenders who fail to register, even if they never cross&para;<br>state lines. Nor does §2250(a)(2)(A) fall within the third&para;<br>category. Congress may not regulate noneconomic activity,&para;<br>such as sex crimes, based on the effect it might have on&para;<br>interstate commerce. Cf. Morrison, supra, at 617. (“We . . .&para;<br>reject the argument that Congress may regulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct’s aggregate effect on interstate commerce”). In short,&para;<br>§2250(a)(2)(A) regulates activity that is neither “ ‘interstate’ ” nor “ ‘commercial,’ ” 687 F. 3d 232, 253 (CA5 2012),&para;<br>and, thus, it cannot be justified on the ground that it&para;<br>executes Congress’ power to regulate interstate commerce.&para;<br>Finally, Congress’ power “[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces”&para;<br>does not support Kebodeaux’s conviction under §2250(a)&para;<br>(2)(A). Art. I, §8, cl. 14. Kebodeaux had long since&para;<br>fully served his criminal sentence for violating Article&para;<br>120(b) of the UCMJ and was no longer in the military&para;<br>when Congress enacted SORNA. Congress does not retain&para;<br>a general police power over every person who has ever&para;<br>served in the military. See United States ex rel. Toth v.&para;<br>Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, 14 (1955) (“It has never been intimated by this Court . . . that Article I military jurisdiction&para;<br>could be extended to civilian ex-soldiers who had severed&para;<br>all relationship with the military and its institutions. . . .&para;<br>[G]iven its natural meaning, the power granted Congress&para;<br>‘To make Rules’ to regulate ‘the land and naval Forces’&para;<br>would seem to restrict court-martial jurisdiction to persons who are actually members or part of the armed&para;<br>forces”).&para;<br>Accordingly, Kebodeaux’s conviction under&para;<br>§2250(a)(2)(A) cannot be sustained based on Congress’&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

I, §8, cl. 18, but is instead aimed at protecting society from sex offenders and&para;<br>violent child predators. See 42 U. S.

It begins&para;<br>by explaining that “at the time of his offense Kebodeaux&para;<br>was subject to the federal Wetterling Act, an Act that&para;<br>imposed upon him registration requirements very similar&para;<br>to those that SORNA later mandated.”3 Ante, at 4. But&para;<br>that is beside the point. Kebodeaux was convicted of&para;<br>violating SORNA’s registration requirements, not the&para;<br>Wetterling Act’s, and so the relevant question is what&para;<br>enumerated power SORNA “carr[ies] into Execution.”&para;<br>“The Necessary and Proper Clause does not provide Congress with authority to enact any law simply because it&para;<br>furthers other laws Congress has enacted in the exercise&para;<br>of its incidental authority; the Clause plainly requires&para;<br>a showing that every federal statute ‘carr[ies] into&para;<br>Execution’ one or more of the Federal Government’s enumerated powers.” Comstock, 560 U. S., at 168 (THOMAS,&para;<br>J., dissenting).&para;<br>Nevertheless, apparently in an effort to bootstrap the&para;<br>Wetterling Act, the Court proceeds to determine whether&para;<br>the Wetterling Act (not SORNA) falls within Congress’&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 THE CHIEF JUSTICE wrongly asserts that the differences between the&para;<br>Wetterling Act and SORNA are “insignificant.” Ante, at 2 (opinion&para;<br>concurring in judgment). SORNA increases the federal penalty for failing to register from a misdemeanor punishable by no more than one&para;<br>year to a felony punishable by up to 10 years for a first offense. Compare 18 U. S. C. §2250(a) with 42 U. S. C. §14072(i) (2000 ed.). It is&para;<br>simply incorrect to minimize that change by saying that Kebodeaux&para;<br>received only a day more than he could have received for failing to&para;<br>register under the Wetterling Act. Ante, at 2 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment). The “legally prescribed range is the penalty affixed&para;<br>to the crime,” Alleyne v. United States, ante, at 11, and SORNA increased that range significantly. SORNA also requires that a sex&para;<br>offender who moves update his registration within three days of moving, instead of seven. Compare 42 U. S. C. §16913(c) with App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 167a–168a.

S. 321, 355 (1903))—a fact that is entirely irrelevant under McCulloch’s first step of determining whether&para;<br>the end is itself legitimate. The Court then observes that&para;<br>the Necessary and Proper Clause&para;<br>“authorizes Congress, in the implementation of other&para;<br>explicit powers, to create federal crimes, to confine offenders to prison, to hire guards and other prison personnel, to provide prisoners with medical care and&para;<br>educational training, to ensure the safety of those who&para;<br>may come into contact with prisoners, to ensure the&para;<br>public’s safety through systems of parole and supervised release, and, where a federal prisoner’s mental&para;<br>condition so requires, to confine that prisoner civilly&para;<br>after the expiration of his or her term of imprisonment.” Ante, at 7.&para;<br>From these powers, the Court reasons that the Wetterling&para;<br>Act is valid because “Congress could reasonably conclude&para;<br>that registration requirements applied to federal sex&para;<br>offenders after their release can help protect the public&para;<br>from those federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety&para;<br>concerns.” Ante, at 8.

All of those actions&para;<br>“carr[y] into Execution” Congress’ power to promote order&para;<br>and discipline within the military by regulating the conduct of military personnel. Art. I, §8, cl. 14.&para;<br>But the enumerated power that justified Kebodeaux’s&para;<br>conviction does not justify requiring him to register as a&para;<br>sex offender now that he is a civilian. If Kebodeaux were&para;<br>required to register as part of his criminal sentence, then&para;<br>registration would help execute the power that justifies&para;<br>his conviction. The court-martial here, however, did not&para;<br>impose registration requirements at Kebodeaux’s sentencing. See ante, at 8 (acknowledging that registration is a&para;<br>“civil requirement” and was “not a specific condition of&para;<br>Kebodeaux’s release”). Enacted long after Kebodeaux had&para;<br>completed his sentence, SORNA cannot be justified as a&para;<br>punishment for the offense Kebodeaux committed while in&para;<br>the military because retroactively increasing his punishment would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. See Peugh&para;<br>v. United States, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 8)&para;<br>(explaining that laws that “ ‘inflic[t] a greater punishment&para;<br>. . . than the law annexed to the crime . . . when committed’ ” violate the Ex Post Facto Clause) (quoting Calder v.&para;<br>Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798)); Peugh, supra, at ___&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 11) (explaining that&para;<br>“laws retroactively increasing the punishment were . . .&para;<br>understood to be ex post facto at the time of the founding”). As the Court below correctly recognized, “because&para;<br>SORNA’s registration requirements are civil and were&para;<br>enacted after Kebodeaux committed his crime, the&para;<br>[G]overnment cannot justify their constitutionality on the&para;<br>ground that they merely punish Kebodeaux for the crime&para;<br>he committed while in the military.” 687 F. 3d, at 239.&para;<br>The only justification for SORNA that the Government&para;<br>has advanced is protection of the public, but that justification has nothing to do with Congress’ power to regulate&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

See&para;<br>Art. VI, cl. 2. “As long as it is acting within the powers&para;<br>granted it under the Constitution, Congress may impose&para;<br>its will on the States.” Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 THE CHIEF JUSTICE contends that Congress has authority to impose&para;<br>registration as a consequence of Kebodeaux’s conviction because “[a]&para;<br>servicemember will be less likely to violate a relevant military regulation if he knows that, having done so, he will be required to register as&para;<br>a sex offender years into the future.” Ante, at 2. But SORNA could not&para;<br>possibly have deterred Kebodeaux from violating any military regulation because it was enacted after he left the military.&para;<br>JUSTICE ALITO contends that, by trying members of the military in a&para;<br>military court, Congress exacerbated “the possibility that a convicted&para;<br>sex offender may escape [the state] registration [system],” and that&para;<br>SORNA is necessary and proper to correct this problem. Ante, at 3&para;<br>(opinion concurring in judgment). But JUSTICE ALITO has not identified&para;<br>any enumerated power that gives Congress authority to address this&para;<br>supposed problem, and there is no evidence that such a problem exists.&para;<br>Indeed, Texas has indicated that SORNA undermines its registration&para;<br>system, rather than making it more effective. See Letter from Jeffrey&para;<br>S. Boyd, General Counsel and Acting Chief of Staff, Texas Office of the&para;<br>Governor, to Linda Baldwin, Director, SMART Office 1 (Aug. 17, 2011)&para;<br>(“Although we in Texas certainly appreciate and agree with the stated&para;<br>goals of SORNA, the adoption of this ‘one-size-fits-all’ federal legislation in Texas would in fact undermine the accomplishment of those&para;<br>objectives in Texas, just as it would in most other states”), online&para;<br>at http: // www.ncleg.net / documentsites / committees / JLOCJPS / October%&para;<br>2013,%202011%20Meeting / RD_SORNA_General_Information_2011-1013.pdf (as visited June 21, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court’s case&para;<br>file).&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>460 (1991). The fact that the Wetterling Act and SORNA&para;<br>may be “narrow” and “[take] state interests into account,”&para;<br>ante, at 10, is “not a matter of constitutional necessity, but&para;<br>an act of legislative grace.” Comstock, 560 U. S., at 178&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., dissenting). These factors have no place in&para;<br>deciding whether a law “Execut[es]” an enumerated power.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Court not only ignores the limitations on Congress’&para;<br>power set forth in the Constitution, but it also ignores the&para;<br>limits that it marked just three years ago in Comstock. In&para;<br>that case, this Court held that Congress has power under&para;<br>the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§4248, which authorizes the Federal Government to civilly&para;<br>commit “sexually dangerous persons” beyond the date it&para;<br>lawfully could hold them on a charge or conviction for a&para;<br>federal crime. Comstock, 560 U. S., at 142. The Court&para;<br>rebuffed the assertion that it was conferring a general&para;<br>police power on Congress by asserting that §4248 was&para;<br>“limited to individuals already ‘in the custody of the’ Federal Government.” Id., at 148. The Solicitor General even&para;<br>conceded at oral argument that “the Federal Government&para;<br>would not have . . . the power to commit a person who . . .&para;<br>has been released from prison and whose period of supervised release is also completed” because “at that point the&para;<br>State police power over a person has been fully reestablished.” Tr. of Oral Arg. in United States v. Comstock O. T.&para;<br>2009, No. 08–1224, p. 9. The Court and the Government&para;<br>today abandon even that meager restriction, which itself&para;<br>lies far beyond the constitutional limits. Kebodeaux was&para;<br>no longer in federal custody when Congress enacted&para;<br>SORNA, yet the Court disregards the fact that, even&para;<br>under Comstock, release from prison and supervised release terminates any hold the Federal Government might&para;<br>otherwise have and “fully reestablishe[d]” the State’s&para;<br>police power over that individual.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.
