HARTFORD LIFE &amp; ACCIDENT&para;<br>&para;<br>INSURANCE CO.

(Hartford) is the&para;<br>administrator of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.’s (Wal-Mart) Group Long&para;<br>Term Disability Plan (Plan), an employee benefit plan covered by the&para;<br>Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The&para;<br>Plan’s insurance policy requires any suit to recover benefits pursuant&para;<br>to the judicial review provision in ERISA §502(a)(1)(B), 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1132(a)(1)(B), to be filed within three years after “proof of loss” is&para;<br>due. Petitioner Heimeshoff filed a claim for long-term disability benefits with Hartford. After petitioner exhausted the mandatory administrative review process, Hartford issued its final denial. Almost&para;<br>three years after that final denial but more than three years after&para;<br>proof of loss was due, Heimeshoff filed a claim for judicial review pursuant to ERISA §502(a)(1)(B). Hartford and Wal-Mart moved to dismiss on the ground that the claim was untimely. The District Court&para;<br>granted the motion, recognizing that while ERISA does not provide a&para;<br>statute of limitations, the contractual 3-year limitations period was&para;<br>enforceable under applicable State law and Circuit precedent. The&para;<br>Second Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: The Plan’s limitations provision is enforceable. Pp. 4–16.&para;<br>(a) The courts of appeals require participants in an employee benefit plan covered by ERISA to exhaust the plan’s administrative remedies before filing suit to recover benefits. A plan participant’s cause&para;<br>of action under ERISA §502(a)(1)(B) therefore does not accrue until&para;<br>the plan issues a final denial. But it does not follow that a plan and&para;<br>its participants cannot agree to commence the limitations period before that time. Pp. 4–8.&para;<br>(1) The rule set forth in Order of United Commercial Travelers of&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HEIMESHOFF v. HARTFORD LIFE &amp; ACCIDENT INS. CO.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>America v. Wolfe, 331 U. S. 586, 608, provides that a contractual limitations provision is enforceable so long as the limitations period is of&para;<br>reasonable length and there is no controlling statute to the contrary.&para;<br>That is the appropriate framework for determining the enforceability&para;<br>of the Plan’s limitations provision. The Wolfe approach necessarily&para;<br>allows parties to agree both to the length of a limitations period and&para;<br>to its commencement. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>(2) The principle that contractual limitations provisions should&para;<br>ordinarily be enforced as written is especially appropriate in the context of an ERISA plan. Heimeshoff’s cause of action is bound up with&para;<br>the written terms of the Plan, and ERISA authorizes a participant to&para;<br>bring suit “to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan.”&para;<br>§1132(a)(1)(B). This Court has thus recognized the particular importance of enforcing plan terms as written in §502(a)(1)(B) claims,&para;<br>see, e.g., CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 563 U. S. ___, ___, and will not presume from statutory silence that Congress intended a different approach here. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(b) Unless the limitations period is unreasonably short or there is a&para;<br>“controlling statute to the contrary,” Wolfe, supra, at 608, the Plan’s&para;<br>limitations provision must be given effect. Pp. 8–16.&para;<br>(1) The Plan’s period is not unreasonably short. Applicable regulations mean for mainstream claims to be resolved by plans in about&para;<br>one year. Here, the Plan’s administrative review process (“internal&para;<br>review”) required more time than usual but still left Heimeshoff with&para;<br>approximately one year to file suit. Her reliance on Occidental Life&para;<br>Ins. Co. of Cal. v. EEOC, 432 U. S. 355, in which this Court declined&para;<br>to enforce a 12-month statute of limitations applied to Title VII employment discrimination actions where the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission faced an 18- to 24-month backlog, is unavailing in the absence of any evidence that similar obstacles exist to&para;<br>bringing a timely ERISA §502(a)(1)(B) claim. Pp. 9–10.&para;<br>(2) This Court rejects the contentions of Heimeshoff and the&para;<br>United States that the limitations provision is unenforceable because&para;<br>it will undermine ERISA’s two-tiered remedial scheme. Pp. 10–15.&para;<br>(i) Enforcement of the Plan’s limitation provision is unlikely to&para;<br>cause participants to shortchange the internal review process. The&para;<br>record for judicial review generally has been limited to the administrative record, so participants who fail to develop evidence during internal review risk forfeiting the use of that evidence in district court.&para;<br>In addition, many plans vest discretion over benefits determinations&para;<br>in the plan administrator, and courts ordinarily review such determinations only for abuse of discretion. Pp. 11–12.&para;<br>(ii) It is also unlikely that enforcing limitations periods that&para;<br>begin to run before the internal review process is exhausted will en-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>danger judicial review. To the extent that administrators attempt to&para;<br>prevent judicial review by delaying the resolution of claims in bad&para;<br>faith, the penalty for failure to meet the regulatory deadlines is immediate access to judicial review for the participant. Evidence from&para;<br>forty years of ERISA administration of this common contractual provision suggests that the good-faith administration of internal review&para;<br>will not diminish the availability of judicial review either.&para;<br>Heimeshoff identifies only a handful of cases in which ERISA&para;<br>§502(a)(1)(B) plaintiffs have been time barred as a result of the 3year limitations provision, and these cases suggest that the bar falls&para;<br>on participants who have not diligently pursued their rights. Moreover, courts are well equipped to apply traditional doctrines, such as&para;<br>waiver or estoppel, see, e.g., Thompson v. Phenix Ins. Co., 136 U. S.&para;<br>287, 298–299, and equitable tolling, see, e.g., Irwin v. Department of&para;<br>Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95, that nevertheless may allow participants to proceed. Finally, plans offering appeals or dispute resolution beyond what is contemplated in the internal review regulations&para;<br>must agree to toll the limitations provision during that time. 29 CFR&para;<br>§2560.503–1(c)(3)(ii). Pp. 12–15.&para;<br>(3) Heimeshoff’s additional arguments are unpersuasive. The&para;<br>limitations period need not be tolled as a matter of course during internal review because that would be inconsistent with the text of the&para;<br>limitations provision, which is enforceable. And federal courts need&para;<br>not inquire whether state law would toll the limitations period during&para;<br>internal review because the limitations period is set by contract, not&para;<br>borrowed from state law.

Her claim form, supported by a statement from her rheumatologist, listed her&para;<br>symptoms as “ ‘extreme fatigue, significant pain, and&para;<br>difficulty in concentration.’ ”1 App. to Pet. for Cert. 7. In&para;<br>November 2005, Hartford notified Heimeshoff that it could&para;<br>not determine whether she was disabled because her&para;<br>rheumatologist had never responded to Hartford’s request&para;<br>for additional information. Hartford denied the claim the&para;<br>following month for failure to provide satisfactory proof of&para;<br>loss. Hartford instructed Heimeshoff that it would consider an appeal filed within 180 days, but later informed her&para;<br>that it would reopen her claim, without the need for an&para;<br>appeal, if her rheumatologist provided the requested&para;<br>information.&para;<br>In July 2006, another physician evaluated Heimeshoff&para;<br>and concluded that she was disabled. Heimeshoff submitted that evaluation and additional medical evidence&para;<br>in October 2006. Hartford then retained a physician to&para;<br>review Heimeshoff ’s records and speak with her rheumatologist. That physician issued a report in November 2006&para;<br>concluding that Heimeshoff was able to perform the activities required by her sedentary occupation.

On September 26, 2007, Heimeshoff submitted&para;<br>her appeal along with additional cardiopulmonary and&para;<br>neuropsychological evaluations.&para;<br>After two additional&para;<br>physicians retained by Hartford reviewed the claim, Hartford issued its final denial on November 26, 2007.&para;<br>On November 18, 2010, almost three years later (but&para;<br>more than three years after proof of loss was due),&para;<br>Heimeshoff filed suit in District Court seeking review of&para;<br>her denied claim pursuant to ERISA §502(a)(1)(B). Hartford and Wal-Mart moved to dismiss on the ground that&para;<br>Heimeshoff ’s complaint was barred by the Plan’s limitations provision, which stated: “Legal action cannot be&para;<br>taken against The Hartford . . . [more than] 3 years after&para;<br>the time written proof of loss is required to be furnished&para;<br>according to the terms of the policy.” Id., at 10.&para;<br>The District Court granted the motion to dismiss. Recognizing that ERISA does not provide a statute of limitations for actions under §502(a)(1)(B), the court explained&para;<br>that the limitations period provided by the most nearly&para;<br>analogous state statute applies. See North Star Steel Co.&para;<br>v. Thomas, 515 U. S. 29, 33–34 (1995). Under Connecticut&para;<br>law, the Plan was permitted to specify a limitations period&para;<br>expiring “[not] less than one year from the time when the&para;<br>loss insured against occurs.”2 Conn. Gen. Stat. §38a–290&para;<br>(2012); see App. to Pet. for Cert. 13. The court held that,&para;<br>under Circuit precedent, a 3-year limitations period set to&para;<br>begin when proof of loss is due is enforceable, and&para;<br>Heimeshoff ’s claim was therefore untimely.3 Id., at 13, 15&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The parties do not dispute that Connecticut provides the relevant&para;<br>state law governing the limitations period in this case.&para;<br>3 Heimeshoff also argued before the District Court that even if the&para;<br>Plan’s limitations provision were enforceable, her suit was still timely&para;<br>because Hartford had granted her request for an extension until&para;<br>September 30, 2007.

S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ERISA and its regulations require plans to provide&para;<br>certain presuit procedures for reviewing claims after participants submit proof of loss (internal review). See 29&para;<br>U. S. C. §1133; 29 CFR §2560.503–1 (2012). The courts of&para;<br>appeals have uniformly required that participants exhaust&para;<br>internal review before bringing a claim for judicial review&para;<br>under §502(a)(1)(B). See LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg &amp;&para;<br>Associates, Inc., 552 U. S. 248, 258–259 (2008) (ROBERTS,&para;<br>C. J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). A&para;<br>participant’s cause of action under ERISA accordingly&para;<br>does not accrue until the plan issues a final denial.&para;<br>ERISA §502(a)(1)(B) does not specify a statute of limitations. Instead, the parties in this case have agreed by&para;<br>contract to a 3-year limitations period. The contract specifies that this period begins to run at the time proof of loss&para;<br>is due. Because proof of loss is due before a participant&para;<br>can exhaust internal review, Heimeshoff contends that&para;<br>this limitations provision runs afoul of the general rule&para;<br>that statutes of limitations commence upon accrual of the&para;<br>cause of action.&para;<br>For the reasons that follow, we reject that argument.&para;<br>Absent a controlling statute to the contrary, a participant&para;<br>and a plan may agree by contract to a particular limitations period, even one that starts to run before the cause of&para;<br>action accrues, as long as the period is reasonable.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Recognizing that Congress generally sets statutory&para;<br>limitations periods to begin when their associated causes&para;<br>of action accrue, this Court has often construed statutes of&para;<br>limitations to commence when the plaintiff is permitted to&para;<br>file suit. See, e.g., Graham County Soil &amp; Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U. S. 409,&para;<br>418 (2005) (resolving an ambiguity in light of “the ‘standard rule that the limitations period commences when the&para;<br>plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action’ ”&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HEIMESHOFF v.

At the same time, we have&para;<br>recognized that statutes of limitations do not inexorably&para;<br>commence upon accrual. See Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U. S.&para;<br>258, 267 (1993) (noting the possibility that a cause of&para;<br>action may “accru[e] at one time for the purpose of calculating when the statute of limitations begins to run, but at&para;<br>another time for the purpose of bringing suit”); see also&para;<br>Dodd v. United States, 545 U. S. 353, 358 (2005) (the&para;<br>statute of limitations in the federal habeas statute runs&para;<br>from “ ‘the date on which the right asserted was initially&para;<br>recognized by the Supreme Court’ ” even if the right has&para;<br>not yet been “ ‘made retroactively applicable to cases on&para;<br>collateral review’ ”); McMahon v. United States, 342 U. S.&para;<br>25, 26–27 (1951) (the limitations period in the Suits in&para;<br>Admiralty Act runs from the date of injury rather than&para;<br>when plaintiffs may sue).&para;<br>None of those decisions, however, addresses the critical&para;<br>aspect of this case: the parties have agreed by contract to&para;<br>commence the limitations period at a particular time. For&para;<br>that reason, we find more appropriate guidance in precedent confronting whether to enforce the terms of a&para;<br>contractual limitations provision. Those cases provide a&para;<br>well-established framework suitable for resolving the question in this case:&para;<br>“[I]n the absence of a controlling statute to the contrary, a provision in a contract may validly limit, between the parties, the time for bringing an action on&para;<br>such contract to a period less than that prescribed in&para;<br>the general statute of limitations, provided that the&para;<br>shorter period itself shall be a reasonable period.”&para;<br>Order of United Commercial Travelers of America v.&para;<br>Wolfe, 331 U. S. 586, 608 (1947).&para;<br>We have recognized that some statutes of limitations do&para;<br>not permit parties to choose a shorter period by contract.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

The rule set forth in Wolfe recognizes, however,&para;<br>that other statutes of limitations provide only a default&para;<br>rule that permits parties to choose a shorter limitations&para;<br>period. See Riddlesbarger v. Hartford Ins. Co., 7 Wall.&para;<br>386, 390 (1869) (finding “nothing in th[e] language or&para;<br>object [of statutes of limitations] which inhibits parties&para;<br>from stipulating for a shorter period within which to assert their respective claims”); see also Missouri, K. &amp; T. R.&para;<br>Co. v. Harriman, 227 U. S. 657, 672–673 (1913) (citing&para;<br>examples). If parties are permitted to contract around a&para;<br>default statute of limitations, it follows that the same rule&para;<br>applies where the statute creating the cause of action is&para;<br>silent regarding a limitations period.&para;<br>The Wolfe rule necessarily allows parties to agree not&para;<br>only to the length of a limitations period but also to its&para;<br>commencement. The duration of a limitations period can&para;<br>be measured only by reference to its start date. Each is&para;<br>therefore an integral part of the limitations provision, and&para;<br>there is no basis for categorically preventing parties from&para;<br>agreeing on one aspect but not the other.

In the absence of any&para;<br>evidence that there are similar obstacles to bringing a&para;<br>timely §502(a)(1)(B) claim, we conclude that the Plan’s&para;<br>limitations provision is reasonable.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Heimeshoff and the United States contend that even if&para;<br>the Plan’s limitations provision is reasonable, ERISA is a&para;<br>“controlling statute to the contrary.” Wolfe, supra, at 608.&para;<br>But they do not contend that ERISA’s statute of limitations for claims of breach of fiduciary duty controls this&para;<br>action to recover benefits. See 29 U. S. C. §1113. Nor do&para;<br>they claim that ERISA’s text or regulations contradict the&para;<br>Plan’s limitations provision. Rather, they assert that the&para;<br>limitations provision will “undermine” ERISA’s two-tiered&para;<br>remedial scheme. Brief for Petitioner 39; Brief for United&para;<br>States as Amicus Curiae 19. We cannot agree.&para;<br>1&para;<br>The first tier of ERISA’s remedial scheme is the internal&para;<br>review process required for all ERISA disability-benefit&para;<br>plans. 29 CFR §2560.503–1. After the participant files a&para;<br>claim for disability benefits, the plan has 45 days to make&para;<br>an “adverse benefit determination.” §2560.503–1(f)(3).&para;<br>Two 30-day extensions are available for “matters beyond&para;<br>the control of the plan,” giving the plan a total of up to 105&para;<br>days to make that determination. Ibid. The plan’s time&para;<br>for making a benefit determination may be tolled “due to&para;<br>a claimant’s failure to submit information necessary to&para;<br>decide a claim.” §2560.503–1(f)(4).&para;<br>Following denial, the plan must provide the participant&para;<br>with “at least 180 days . . . within which to appeal the&para;<br>determination.” §§2560.503–1(h)(3)(i), (h)(4). The plan&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>has 45 days to resolve that appeal, with one 45-day extension available for “special circumstances (such as the need&para;<br>to hold a hearing).” §§2560.503–1(i)(1)(i), (i)(3)(i). The&para;<br>plan’s time for resolving an appeal can be tolled again if&para;<br>the participant fails to submit necessary information.&para;<br>§2560.503–1(i)(4). In the ordinary course, the regulations&para;<br>contemplate an internal review process lasting about one&para;<br>year. Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. If the plan fails to meet its own&para;<br>deadlines under these procedures, the participant “shall&para;<br>be deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies.” §2560.503–1(l). Upon exhaustion of the internal&para;<br>review process, the participant is entitled to proceed immediately to judicial review, the second tier of ERISA’s&para;<br>remedial scheme.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Heimeshoff and the United States first claim that the&para;<br>Plan’s limitations provision will undermine the foregoing&para;<br>internal review process. They contend that participants&para;<br>will shortchange their own rights during that process in&para;<br>order to have more time in which to seek judicial review.&para;<br>Their premise—that participants will sacrifice the benefits&para;<br>of internal review to preserve additional time for filing&para;<br>suit—is highly dubious in light of the consequences of that&para;<br>course of action.&para;<br>First, to the extent participants fail to develop evidence&para;<br>during internal review, they risk forfeiting the use of that&para;<br>evidence in district court. The Courts of Appeals have&para;<br>generally limited the record for judicial review to the&para;<br>administrative record compiled during internal review.&para;<br>See, e.g., Foster v. PPG Industries, Inc., 693 F. 3d 1226,&para;<br>1231 (CA10 2012); Fleisher v. Standard Ins. Co., 679 F. 3d&para;<br>116, 121 (CA3 2012); McCartha v. National City Corp.,&para;<br>419 F. 3d 437, 441 (CA6 2005). Second, participants are&para;<br>not likely to value judicial review of plan determinations&para;<br>over internal review. Many plans (including this Plan)&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HEIMESHOFF v. HARTFORD LIFE &amp; ACCIDENT INS. CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>vest discretion over benefits determinations in plan administrators. See Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch,&para;<br>489 U. S. 101, 111–112 (1989) (permitting the vesting of&para;<br>discretion); see also App. in No. 12–651–cv (CA2), p. 34.&para;<br>Courts ordinarily review determinations by such plans&para;<br>only for abuse of discretion. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.&para;<br>Glenn, 554 U. S. 105, 115–116 (2008). In short, participants have much to lose and little to gain by giving up the&para;<br>full measure of internal review in favor of marginal extra&para;<br>time to seek judicial review.&para;<br>3&para;<br>Heimeshoff and the United States next warn that it will&para;<br>endanger judicial review to allow plans to set limitations&para;<br>periods that begin to run before internal review is complete. The United States suggests that administrators&para;<br>may attempt to prevent judicial review by delaying the&para;<br>resolution of claims in bad faith. Brief for United States&para;<br>as Amicus Curiae 19; see also White, 488 F. 3d, at 247–&para;<br>248. But administrators are required by the regulations&para;<br>governing the internal review process to take prompt&para;<br>action, see supra, at 10–11, and the penalty for failure to&para;<br>meet those deadlines is immediate access to judicial review for the participant. 29 CFR §2560.503–1(l). In addition, that sort of dilatory behavior may implicate one of&para;<br>the traditional defenses to a statute of limitations. See&para;<br>infra, at 14–15.&para;<br>The United States suggests that even good-faith administration of internal review will significantly diminish the&para;<br>availability of judicial review if this limitations provision&para;<br>is enforced. Forty years of ERISA administration suggest otherwise. The limitations provision at issue is quite&para;<br>common; the vast majority of States require certain insurance policies to include 3-year limitations periods that run&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>from the date proof of loss is due.5 But there is no significant evidence that limitations provisions like the one here&para;<br>have similarly thwarted judicial review. As explained&para;<br>above, see supra, at 10–11, ERISA regulations structure&para;<br>internal review to proceed in an expeditious manner. It&para;<br>stands to reason that the cases in which internal review&para;<br>leaves participants with less than one year to file suit are&para;<br>rare. Heimeshoff identifies only a handful of cases in&para;<br>which §502(a)(1)(B) plaintiffs are actually time barred as a&para;<br>result of this 3-year limitations provision.

Those cases suggest that this barrier falls&para;<br>on participants who have not diligently pursued their&para;<br>rights. See Abena, supra, at 884 (by his own admission,&para;<br>there was “no reason” plaintiff could not have filed suit&para;<br>during the remaining seven months of limitations period);&para;<br>Smith, supra, at *2 (plaintiff filed suit four years after the&para;<br>limitations period expired, and six years after final denial); Rotondi, supra, at *8 (“Application of the . . . limitations period works no unfairness here”); see also Rice, 578&para;<br>F. 3d, at 457 (the participant “has not established that he&para;<br>has been diligently pursuing his rights” and “has given no&para;<br>reason for his late filing”); Burke, 572 F. 3d, at 81 (following exhaustion, “two years and five months of the limitations period remained”); Salerno v.

If the administrator’s conduct&para;<br>causes a participant to miss the deadline for judicial review, waiver or estoppel may prevent the administrator&para;<br>from invoking the limitations provision as a defense.

Thus, we are not persuaded&para;<br>that the Plan’s limitations provision is inconsistent with&para;<br>ERISA.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Two additional arguments warrant mention. First,&para;<br>Heimeshoff argues—for the first time in this litigation—&para;<br>that the limitations period should be tolled as a matter of&para;<br>course during internal review. By effectively delaying the&para;<br>commencement of the limitations period until the conclusion of internal review, however, this approach reconstitutes the contractual revision we declined to make. As we&para;<br>explained, the parties’ agreement should be enforced&para;<br>unless the limitations period is unreasonably short or&para;<br>foreclosed by ERISA. The limitations period here is neither. See supra, at 9–10, 11–14, and this page.&para;<br>Nor do the ERISA regulations require tolling during&para;<br>internal review. A plan must agree to toll the limitations&para;<br>provision only in one particular circumstance: when a plan&para;<br>offers voluntary internal appeals beyond what is permitted by regulation. §2560.503–1(c)(3)(ii). Even then, the&para;<br>limitations period is tolled only during that specific portion of internal review. This limited tolling requirement&para;<br>would be superfluous if the regulations contemplated&para;<br>tolling throughout the process.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Whether the Court of Appeals properly declined to apply those doctrines in this case is not before us. 569 U.

S. 536 (1989), Heimeshoff contends that we must inquire whether state law would toll the limitations period&para;<br>throughout the exhaustion process. In Hardin, we interpreted 42 U. S. C. §1983 to borrow a State’s statutory&para;<br>limitations period. We recognized that when a federal&para;<br>statute is deemed to borrow a State’s limitations period,&para;<br>the State’s tolling rules are ordinarily borrowed as well&para;<br>because “ ‘[i]n virtually all statutes of limitations the&para;<br>chronological length of the limitation period is interrelated&para;<br>with provisions regarding tolling . . . .’ ” 490 U.

S. 478, 484 (1980) (in&para;<br>§1983 actions “a state statute of limitations and the coordinate tolling rules” are “binding rules of law”). But here,&para;<br>unlike in Hardin, the parties have adopted a limitations&para;<br>period by contract.
