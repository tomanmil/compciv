UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE TENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–895.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued November 12, 2013—Decided March 5, 2014&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner Justus Rosemond took part in a drug deal in which either he&para;<br>or one of his confederates fired a gun. Because the shooter’s identity&para;<br>was disputed, the Government charged Rosemond with violating 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §924(c) by using or carrying a gun in connection with a drug&para;<br>trafficking crime, or, in the alternative, aiding and abetting that offense under 18 U. S. C. §2. The trial judge instructed the jury that&para;<br>Rosemond was guilty of aiding and abetting the §924(c) offense if he&para;<br>(1) “knew his cohort used a firearm in the drug trafficking crime” and&para;<br>(2) “knowingly and actively participated in the drug trafficking&para;<br>crime.” This deviated from Rosemond’s proposed instruction that the&para;<br>jury must find that he acted intentionally “to facilitate or encourage”&para;<br>the firearm’s use, as opposed to merely the predicate drug offense.&para;<br>Rosemond was convicted, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed, rejecting&para;<br>his argument that the District Court’s aiding and abetting instructions were erroneous.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The Government establishes that a defendant aided and abetted&para;<br>a §924(c) violation by proving that the defendant actively participated in the underlying drug trafficking or violent crime with advance&para;<br>knowledge that a confederate would use or carry a gun during the&para;<br>crime’s commission. Pp. 5–16.&para;<br>(a) The federal aiding and abetting statute, which derives from&para;<br>common-law standards for accomplice liability, has two components.&para;<br>A person is liable under §2 only if he (1) takes an affirmative act in&para;<br>furtherance of the underlying offense (2) with the intent to facilitate&para;<br>that offense’s commission. Pp. 5–6.&para;<br>(b) The first question is whether Rosemond’s conduct was sufficient to satisfy the affirmative act requirement of aiding and abet-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ting. Section 924(c) has two elements: a drug deal or violent crime,&para;<br>and using or carrying a firearm in connection with that crime. The&para;<br>instructions permitted the jury to convict Rosemond of aiding and&para;<br>abetting even if he facilitated only the drug element, and not the gun&para;<br>element, of the §924(c) offense. Those instructions were correct. The&para;<br>common law imposed aiding and abetting liability on a person who&para;<br>facilitated any element of a criminal offense, even if he did not facilitate all elements. That principle continues to govern §2. See, e.g.,&para;<br>United States v. Johnson, 319 U. S. 503, 515. Pp. 6–11.&para;<br>(c) In addition to conduct extending to some part of the crime,&para;<br>aiding and abetting requires intent extending to the whole crime.&para;<br>The defendant must not just associate himself with the venture, but&para;<br>also participate in it as something that he wishes to bring about and&para;<br>seek by his actions to make it succeed. Nye &amp; Nissen v. United&para;<br>States, 336 U. S. 613, 619. That requirement is satisfied when a person actively participates in a criminal venture with full knowledge of&para;<br>the circumstances constituting the charged offense. See Pereira v.&para;<br>United States, 347 U. S. 1, 12. An active participant in a drug transaction has the intent needed to aid and abet a §924(c) violation when&para;<br>he knows that one of his confederates will carry a gun. This must be&para;<br>advance knowledge—meaning, knowledge at a time when the accomplice has a reasonable opportunity to walk away. Pp. 11–16.&para;<br>2. The trial court’s jury instructions were erroneous because they&para;<br>failed to require that Rosemond knew in advance that one of his cohorts would be armed. In telling the jury to consider merely whether&para;<br>Rosemond “knew his cohort used a firearm,” the court did not direct&para;<br>the jury to determine when Rosemond obtained the requisite&para;<br>knowledge—i.e., to decide whether Rosemond knew about the gun in&para;<br>sufficient time to withdraw from the crime. The case is remanded to&para;<br>permit the Tenth Circuit to address whether this objection was&para;<br>properly preserved and whether any error was harmless.

One of&para;<br>those men apparently took the front passenger seat and&para;<br>the other sat in the back, but witnesses dispute who was&para;<br>where. At the designated meeting place, Gonzales climbed&para;<br>into the car’s backseat while Painter waited outside. The&para;<br>backseat passenger allowed Gonzales to inspect the marijuana. But rather than handing over money, Gonzales&para;<br>punched that man in the face and fled with the drugs. As&para;<br>Gonzales and Painter ran away, one of the male passengers—&para;<br>but again, which one is contested—exited the car and&para;<br>fired several shots from a semiautomatic handgun. The&para;<br>shooter then re-entered the vehicle, and all three wouldbe drug dealers gave chase after the buyers-turnedrobbers. But before the three could catch their quarry,&para;<br>a police officer, responding to a dispatcher’s alert, pulled&para;<br>their car over. This federal prosecution of Rosemond&para;<br>followed.1&para;<br>The Government charged Rosemond with, inter alia,&para;<br>violating §924(c) by using a gun in connection with a drug&para;<br>trafficking crime, or aiding and abetting that offense&para;<br>under §2 of Title 18. Section 924(c) provides that “any&para;<br>person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence&para;<br>or drug trafficking crime[,] . . . uses or carries a firearm,”&para;<br>shall receive a five-year mandatory-minimum sentence,&para;<br>with seven- and ten-year minimums applicable, respectively, if the firearm is also brandished or discharged. 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A). Section 2, for its part, is the federal&para;<br>aiding and abetting statute: It provides that “[w]hoever&para;<br>commits an offense against the United States or aids,&para;<br>abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission is punishable as a principal.”&para;<br>Consistent with the indictment, the Government prose——————&para;<br>1 The Government agreed not to bring charges against the other four&para;<br>participants in the narcotics deal in exchange for their giving truthful&para;<br>testimony against Rosemond. See 2 Record 245, 272, 295–296, 318.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cuted the §924(c) charge on two alternative theories. The&para;<br>Government’s primary contention was that Rosemond&para;<br>himself used the firearm during the aborted drug transaction. But recognizing that the identity of the shooter was&para;<br>disputed, the Government also offered a back-up argument: Even if it was Joseph who fired the gun as the drug&para;<br>deal fell apart, Rosemond aided and abetted the §924(c)&para;<br>violation.&para;<br>The District Judge accordingly instructed the jury on&para;<br>aiding and abetting law. He first explained, in a way&para;<br>challenged by neither party, the rudiments of §2. Under&para;<br>that statute, the judge stated, “[a] person who aids or&para;<br>abets another to commit an offense is just as guilty of that&para;<br>offense as if he committed it himself.” App. 195. And in&para;<br>order to aid or abet, the defendant must “willfully and&para;<br>knowingly associate[ ] himself in some way with the crime,&para;<br>and . . . seek[ ] by some act to help make the crime succeed.” Id., at 196. The judge then turned to applying&para;<br>those general principles to §924(c)—and there, he deviated&para;<br>from an instruction Rosemond had proposed. According to&para;<br>Rosemond, a defendant could be found guilty of aiding or&para;<br>abetting a §924(c) violation only if he “intentionally took&para;<br>some action to facilitate or encourage the use of the firearm,” as opposed to the predicate drug offense. Id., at 14.&para;<br>But the District Judge disagreed, instead telling the jury&para;<br>that it could convict if “(1) the defendant knew his cohort&para;<br>used a firearm in the drug trafficking crime, and (2) the&para;<br>defendant knowingly and actively participated in the drug&para;<br>trafficking crime.” Id., at 196. In closing argument, the&para;<br>prosecutor contended that Rosemond easily satisfied that&para;<br>standard, so that even if he had not “fired the gun, he’s&para;<br>still guilty of the crime.” Id., at 158. After all, the prosecutor stated, Rosemond “certainly knew [of] and actively&para;<br>participated in” the drug transaction. Ibid. “And with&para;<br>regards to the other element,” the prosecutor urged, “the&para;<br>fact is a person cannot be present and active at a drug deal&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>when shots are fired and not know their cohort is using a&para;<br>gun. You simply can’t do it.” Ibid.&para;<br>The jury convicted Rosemond of violating §924(c) (as&para;<br>well as all other offenses charged). The verdict form was&para;<br>general: It did not reveal whether the jury found that&para;<br>Rosemond himself had used the gun or instead had aided&para;<br>and abetted a confederate’s use during the marijuana deal.&para;<br>As required by §924(c), the trial court imposed a consecutive sentence of 120 months of imprisonment for the&para;<br>statute’s violation.&para;<br>The Tenth Circuit affirmed, rejecting Rosemond’s argument that the District Court’s aiding and abetting instructions were erroneous.2 The Court of Appeals acknowledged&para;<br>that some other Circuits agreed with Rosemond that&para;<br>a defendant aids and abets a §924(c) offense only if he&para;<br>intentionally takes “some action to facilitate or encourage&para;<br>his cohort’s use of the firearm.” 695 F. 3d 1151, 1155&para;<br>(2012).3 But the Tenth Circuit had already adopted a&para;<br>different standard, which it thought consonant with the&para;<br>District Court’s instructions. See, e.g., United States v.&para;<br>Wiseman, 172 F. 3d 1196, 1217 (1999) (requiring that the&para;<br>defendant “actively participated in the” underlying crime&para;<br>and “knew [his confederate] was carrying [a] firearm”).&para;<br>And the Court of Appeals held that Rosemond had presented no sufficient reason for departing from that precedent. See 695 F. 3d, at 1156.&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 569 U. S. ___ (2013), to resolve&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The Court of Appeals stated that it had to address that argument&para;<br>even if the jury could have found that Rosemond himself fired the gun,&para;<br>because “a conviction based on a general verdict is subject to challenge&para;<br>if the jury was instructed on alternative theories of guilt and may have&para;<br>relied on an invalid one.” 695 F. 3d 1151, 1154 (2012) (quoting&para;<br>Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555 U. S. 57, 58 (2008) (per curiam)).&para;<br>3 See, e.g., United States v. Rolon-Ramos, 502 F. 3d 750, 758–759&para;<br>(CA8 2007); United States v. Medina-Roman, 376 F. 3d 1, 6 (CA1 2004);&para;<br>United States v. Bancalari, 110 F. 3d 1425, 1429–1430 (CA9 1997).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Although we disagree with Rosemond’s&para;<br>principal arguments, we find that the trial court erred in&para;<br>instructing the jury. We therefore vacate the judgment&para;<br>below.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The federal aiding and abetting statute, 18 U. S. C. §2,&para;<br>states that a person who furthers—more specifically, who&para;<br>“aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures”—&para;<br>the commission of a federal offense “is punishable as a&para;<br>principal.” That provision derives from (though simplifies)&para;<br>common-law standards for accomplice liability. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Standefer v. United States, 447 U. S. 10, 14–19 (1980);&para;<br>United States v. Peoni, 100 F. 2d 401, 402 (CA2 1938)&para;<br>(L. Hand, J.) (“The substance of [§2’s] formula goes back&para;<br>a long way”). And in so doing, §2 reflects a centuries-old&para;<br>view of culpability: that a person may be responsible for a&para;<br>crime he has not personally carried out if he helps another&para;<br>to complete its commission. See J. Hawley &amp; M. McGregor,&para;<br>Criminal Law 81 (1899).&para;<br>We have previously held that under §2 “those who provide knowing aid to persons committing federal crimes,&para;<br>with the intent to facilitate the crime, are themselves&para;<br>committing a crime.” Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v.&para;<br>First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 181&para;<br>(1994). Both parties here embrace that formulation, and&para;<br>agree as well that it has two components. See Brief for&para;<br>Petitioner 28; Brief for United States 14. As at common&para;<br>law, a person is liable under §2 for aiding and abetting a&para;<br>crime if (and only if) he (1) takes an affirmative act in&para;<br>furtherance of that offense, (2) with the intent of facilitating the offense’s commission. See 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law §13.2, p. 337 (2003) (hereinafter&para;<br>LaFave) (an accomplice is liable as a principal when he gives&para;<br>“assistance or encouragement . . . with the intent thereby&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to promote or facilitate commission of the crime”); Hicks v.&para;<br>United States, 150 U. S. 442, 449 (1893) (an accomplice is&para;<br>liable when his acts of assistance are done “with the intention of encouraging and abetting” the crime).&para;<br>The questions that the parties dispute, and we here&para;<br>address, concern how those two requirements—affirmative&para;<br>act and intent—apply in a prosecution for aiding and&para;<br>abetting a §924(c) offense. Those questions arise from the&para;<br>compound nature of that provision. Recall that §924(c)&para;<br>forbids “us[ing] or carr[ying] a firearm” when engaged in a&para;<br>“crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.” See supra, at&para;<br>2. The prosecutor must show the use or carriage of a gun;&para;<br>so too he must prove the commission of a predicate (violent&para;<br>or drug trafficking) offense. See Smith v. United States,&para;<br>508 U. S. 223, 228 (1993). For purposes of ascertaining&para;<br>aiding and abetting liability, we therefore must consider:&para;<br>When does a person act to further this double-barreled&para;<br>crime? And when does he intend to facilitate its commission? We address each issue in turn.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Consider first Rosemond’s account of his conduct (divorced from any issues of intent). Rosemond actively participated in a drug transaction, accompanying two others&para;<br>to a site where money was to be exchanged for a pound&para;<br>of marijuana. But as he tells it, he took no action&para;<br>with respect to any firearm. He did not buy or borrow a&para;<br>gun to facilitate the narcotics deal; he did not carry a gun&para;<br>to the scene; he did not use a gun during the subsequent&para;<br>events constituting this criminal misadventure. His acts thus&para;<br>advanced one part (the drug part) of a two-part incident—&para;<br>or to speak a bit more technically, one element (the&para;<br>drug element) of a two-element crime. Is that enough to&para;<br>satisfy the conduct requirement of this aiding and abetting&para;<br>charge, or must Rosemond, as he claims, have taken some&para;<br>act to assist the commission of the other (firearm) compo-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>nent of §924(c)?&para;<br>The common law imposed aiding and abetting liability&para;<br>on a person (possessing the requisite intent) who facilitated any part—even though not every part—of a criminal&para;<br>venture. As a leading treatise, published around the time&para;<br>of §2’s enactment, put the point: Accomplice liability attached upon proof of “[a]ny participation in a general&para;<br>felonious plan” carried out by confederates. 1 F. Wharton,&para;<br>Criminal Law §251, p. 322 (11th ed. 1912) (hereinafter&para;<br>Wharton) (emphasis added). Or in the words of another&para;<br>standard reference: If a person was “present abetting&para;<br>while any act necessary to constitute the offense [was]&para;<br>being performed through another,” he could be charged as&para;<br>a principal—even “though [that act was] not the whole&para;<br>thing necessary.” 1 J. Bishop, Commentaries on the Criminal Law §649, p. 392 (7th ed. 1882) (emphasis added).&para;<br>And so “[w]here several acts constitute[d] together one&para;<br>crime, if each [was] separately performed by a different&para;<br>individual[,] . . . all [were] principals as to the whole.” Id.,&para;<br>§650, at 392.4 Indeed, as yet a third treatise underscored,&para;<br>a person’s involvement in the crime could be not merely&para;<br>partial but minimal too: “The quantity [of assistance was]&para;<br>immaterial,” so long as the accomplice did “something” to&para;<br>aid the crime. R. Desty, A Compendium of American&para;<br>Criminal Law §37a, p. 106 (1882) (emphasis added). After&para;<br>all, the common law maintained, every little bit helps—&para;<br>and a contribution to some part of a crime aids the whole.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The Wharton treatise gave the following example of how multiple&para;<br>confederates could perform different roles in carrying out a crime.&para;<br>Assume, Wharton hypothesized, that several persons “act in concert to&para;<br>steal a man’s goods.” Wharton §251, at 322. The victim is “induced by&para;<br>fraud to trust one of them[,] in the presence of [the] others[,] with the&para;<br>[goods’] possession.” Ibid. Afterward, “another of the party entice[s]&para;<br>the owner away so that he who has the goods may carry them off.” Id.,&para;<br>at 322–323. Wharton concludes: “[A]ll are guilty as principals.” Id.,&para;<br>at 323.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>That principle continues to govern aiding and abetting&para;<br>law under §2: As almost every court of appeals has held,&para;<br>“[a] defendant can be convicted as an aider and abettor&para;<br>without proof that he participated in each and every element of the offense.” United States v. Sigalow, 812 F. 2d&para;<br>783, 785 (CA2 1987).5 In proscribing aiding and abetting,&para;<br>Congress used language that “comprehends all assistance&para;<br>rendered by words, acts, encouragement, support, or presence,” Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, 507 U. S. 170, 178 (1993)—&para;<br>even if that aid relates to only one (or some) of a crime’s&para;<br>phases or elements. So, for example, in upholding convictions for abetting a tax evasion scheme, this Court found&para;<br>“irrelevant” the defendants’ “non-participation” in filing a&para;<br>false return; we thought they had amply facilitated the&para;<br>illegal scheme by helping a confederate conceal his assets.&para;<br>United States v. Johnson, 319 U. S. 503, 515, 518 (1943).&para;<br>“[A]ll who shared in [the overall crime’s] execution,” we&para;<br>explained, “have equal responsibility before the law, whatever may have been [their] different roles.” Id., at 515.&para;<br>And similarly, we approved a conviction for abetting mail&para;<br>fraud even though the defendant had played no part in&para;<br>mailing the fraudulent documents; it was enough to satisfy the law’s conduct requirement that he had in other&para;<br>ways aided the deception. See Pereira v. United States,&para;<br>347 U. S. 1, 8–11 (1954).

Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U. S.&para;<br>275, 280 (1999); see supra, at 6. In enacting the statute,&para;<br>“Congress proscribed both the use of the firearm and the&para;<br>commission of acts that constitute” a drug trafficking&para;<br>crime. Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U. S, at 281. Rosemond&para;<br>therefore could assist in §924(c)’s violation by facilitating&para;<br>either the drug transaction or the firearm use (or of course&para;<br>both). In helping to bring about one part of the offense&para;<br>(whether trafficking drugs or using a gun), he necessarily&para;<br>helped to complete the whole. And that ends the analysis&para;<br>as to his conduct. It is inconsequential, as courts applying&para;<br>both the common law and §2 have held, that his acts did&para;<br>not advance each element of the offense; all that matters&para;<br>is that they facilitated one component.&para;<br>Rosemond argues, to the contrary, that the requisite act&para;<br>here “must be directed at the use of the firearm,” because&para;<br>that element is §924(c)’s most essential feature.

But Rosemond can provide no author——————&para;<br>6 Consider a hypothetical similar to Johnson and Pereira (and a modern variant of the Wharton treatise’s, see n. 4, supra). Suppose that as&para;<br>part of a kidnapping scheme, one accomplice lures the victim into a car&para;<br>under false pretenses; another drives the vehicle; a third allows the use&para;<br>of her house to hold the victim captive; and still a fourth keeps watch&para;<br>outside to divert potential witnesses. None would have personally&para;<br>completed, or even assisted with, all elements of the offense. See, e.g.,&para;<br>United States v. Cervantes-Blanco, 504 F. 3d 576, 580 (CA5 2007)&para;<br>(listing elements). But (if they had the requisite intent) all would be&para;<br>liable under §2.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ity for demanding that an affirmative act go toward an&para;<br>element considered peculiarly significant; rather, as just&para;<br>noted, courts have never thought relevant the importance&para;<br>of the aid rendered. See supra, at 7–8. And in any event,&para;<br>we reject Rosemond’s premise that §924(c) is somehow&para;<br>more about using guns than selling narcotics. It is true&para;<br>enough, as Rosemond says in support of that theory, that&para;<br>§924(c) “establishes a separate, freestanding offense that&para;<br>is ‘distinct from the underlying [drug trafficking crime].’ ”&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 32 (quoting Simpson v. United States,&para;<br>435 U. S. 6, 10 (1978)). But it is just as true that §924(c)&para;<br>establishes a freestanding offense distinct from any that&para;<br>might apply just to using a gun—say, for discharging a&para;<br>firearm in a public park. That is because §924(c) is, to&para;<br>coin a term, a combination crime. It punishes the temporal and relational conjunction of two separate acts, on&para;<br>the ground that together they pose an extreme risk of&para;<br>harm. See Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 132&para;<br>(1998) (noting that §924(c)’s “basic purpose” was “to combat the dangerous combination of drugs and guns”). And&para;<br>so, an act relating to drugs, just as much as an act relating&para;<br>to guns, facilitates a §924(c) violation.&para;<br>Rosemond’s related argument that our approach would&para;<br>conflate two distinct offenses—allowing a conviction for&para;<br>abetting a §924(c) violation whenever the prosecution&para;<br>shows that the defendant abetted the underlying drug&para;<br>trafficking crime—fares no better. See Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>38. That is because, as we will describe, an aiding and&para;<br>abetting conviction requires not just an act facilitating one&para;<br>or another element, but also a state of mind extending to&para;<br>the entire crime. See infra, at 11. And under that rule, a&para;<br>defendant may be convicted of abetting a §924(c) violation&para;<br>only if his intent reaches beyond a simple drug sale, to an&para;<br>armed one. Aiding and abetting law’s intent component—&para;<br>to which we now turn—thus preserves the distinction&para;<br>between assisting the predicate drug trafficking crime and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

As previously explained, a person aids and abets&para;<br>a crime when (in addition to taking the requisite act) he&para;<br>intends to facilitate that offense’s commission. See supra,&para;<br>at 5–6. An intent to advance some different or lesser&para;<br>offense is not, or at least not usually, sufficient: Instead,&para;<br>the intent must go to the specific and entire crime&para;<br>charged—so here, to the full scope (predicate crime plus&para;<br>gun use) of §924(c). See, e.g., 2 LaFave §13.2(c); W. Clark&para;<br>&amp; W. Marshall, Law of Crimes, §187, pp. 251–253 (2d ed.&para;<br>1905); ALI, Model Penal Code §2.06 Comment, p. 306&para;<br>(1985).7 And the canonical formulation of that needed&para;<br>state of mind—later appropriated by this Court and oftquoted in both parties’ briefs—is Judge Learned Hand’s:&para;<br>To aid and abet a crime, a defendant must not just “in&para;<br>some sort associate himself with the venture,” but also&para;<br>“participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring&para;<br>about” and “seek by his action to make it succeed.” Nye &amp;&para;<br>Nissen v.

That question is not implicated here, because no one contends&para;<br>that a §924(c) violation is a natural and probable consequence of simple&para;<br>drug trafficking. We therefore express no view on the issue.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tuting the charged offense. In Pereira, the mail fraud case&para;<br>discussed above, we found the requisite intent for aiding&para;<br>and abetting because the defendant took part in a fraud&para;<br>“know[ing]” that his confederate would take care of the&para;<br>mailing. 347 U. S., at 12; see supra, at 8. Likewise, in&para;<br>Bozza v. United States, 330 U. S. 160, 165 (1947), we upheld a conviction for aiding and abetting the evasion of&para;<br>liquor taxes because the defendant helped operate a clandestine distillery “know[ing]” the business was set up “to&para;<br>violate Government revenue laws.” And several Courts of&para;<br>Appeals have similarly held—addressing a fact pattern&para;<br>much like this one—that the unarmed driver of a getaway&para;<br>car had the requisite intent to aid and abet armed bank&para;<br>robbery if he “knew” that his confederates would use&para;<br>weapons in carrying out the crime. See, e.g., United States&para;<br>v. Akiti, 701 F. 3d 883, 887 (CA8 2012); United States v.&para;<br>Easter, 66 F. 3d 1018, 1024 (CA9 1995). So for purposes of&para;<br>aiding and abetting law, a person who actively participates in a criminal scheme knowing its extent and character intends that scheme’s commission.8&para;<br>The same principle holds here: An active participant in&para;<br>a drug transaction has the intent needed to aid and abet a&para;<br>§924(c) violation when he knows that one of his confederates will carry a gun. In such a case, the accomplice has&para;<br>decided to join in the criminal venture, and share in its&para;<br>benefits, with full awareness of its scope—that the plan&para;<br>calls not just for a drug sale, but for an armed one. In so&para;<br>doing, he has chosen (like the abettors in Pereira and&para;<br>Bozza or the driver in an armed robbery) to align himself&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 We did not deal in these cases, nor do we here, with defendants who&para;<br>incidentally facilitate a criminal venture rather than actively participate in it. A hypothetical case is the owner of a gun store who sells a&para;<br>firearm to a criminal, knowing but not caring how the gun will be used.&para;<br>We express no view about what sort of facts, if any, would suffice to&para;<br>show that such a third party has the intent necessary to be convicted of&para;<br>aiding and abetting.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>with the illegal scheme in its entirety—including its use of&para;<br>a firearm. And he has determined (again like those other&para;<br>abettors) to do what he can to “make [that scheme] succeed.” Nye &amp; Nissen, 336 U. S., at 619. He thus becomes&para;<br>responsible, in the typical way of aiders and abettors, for&para;<br>the conduct of others. He may not have brought the gun&para;<br>to the drug deal himself, but because he took part in that&para;<br>deal knowing a confederate would do so, he intended the&para;<br>commission of a §924(c) offense—i.e., an armed drug sale.&para;<br>For all that to be true, though, the §924(c) defendant’s&para;<br>knowledge of a firearm must be advance knowledge—or&para;<br>otherwise said, knowledge that enables him to make the&para;<br>relevant legal (and indeed, moral) choice. When an accomplice knows beforehand of a confederate’s design to&para;<br>carry a gun, he can attempt to alter that plan or, if unsuccessful, withdraw from the enterprise; it is deciding instead to go ahead with his role in the venture that shows&para;<br>his intent to aid an armed offense. But when an accomplice knows nothing of a gun until it appears at the scene,&para;<br>he may already have completed his acts of assistance; or&para;<br>even if not, he may at that late point have no realistic&para;<br>opportunity to quit the crime. And when that is so, the&para;<br>defendant has not shown the requisite intent to assist a&para;<br>crime involving a gun. As even the Government concedes,&para;<br>an unarmed accomplice cannot aid and abet a §924(c)&para;<br>violation unless he has “foreknowledge that his confederate will commit the offense with a firearm.” Brief for&para;<br>United States 38; see also infra, at 15–17. For the reasons&para;<br>just given, we think that means knowledge at a time the&para;<br>accomplice can do something with it—most notably, opt to&para;<br>walk away.9&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Of course, if a defendant continues to participate in a crime after a&para;<br>gun was displayed or used by a confederate, the jury can permissibly&para;<br>infer from his failure to object or withdraw that he had such knowledge.&para;<br>In any criminal case, after all, the factfinder can draw inferences about&para;<br>a defendant’s intent based on all the facts and circumstances of a&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Both parties here find something to dislike in our view&para;<br>of this issue. Rosemond argues that a participant in a&para;<br>drug deal intends to assist a §924(c) violation only if he&para;<br>affirmatively desires one of his confederates to use a gun.&para;<br>See Reply Brief 8–11. The jury, Rosemond concedes, could&para;<br>infer that state of mind from the defendant’s advance&para;<br>knowledge that the plan included a firearm. See Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 5. But according to Rosemond, the instructions&para;<br>must also permit the jury to draw the opposite conclusion—&para;<br>that although the defendant participated in a drug&para;<br>deal knowing a gun would be involved, he did not specifically want its carriage or use. That higher standard,&para;<br>Rosemond claims, is necessary to avoid subjecting persons&para;<br>of different culpability to the same punishment. Rosemond offers as an example an unarmed driver assisting in&para;<br>the heist of a store: If that person spent the drive “trying&para;<br>to persuade [his confederate] to leave [the] gun behind,”&para;<br>then he should be convicted of abetting shoplifting, but not&para;<br>armed robbery. Reply Brief 9.&para;<br>We think not. What matters for purposes of gauging&para;<br>intent, and so what jury instructions should convey, is&para;<br>that the defendant has chosen, with full knowledge, to&para;<br>participate in the illegal scheme—not that, if all had been&para;<br>left to him, he would have planned the identical crime.&para;<br>Consider a variant of Rosemond’s example: The driver of a&para;<br>getaway car wants to help rob a convenience store (and&para;<br>argues passionately for that plan), but eventually accedes&para;<br>when his confederates decide instead to hold up a national&para;<br>bank. Whatever his original misgivings, he has the requisite intent to aid and abet bank robbery; after all, he put&para;<br>aside those doubts and knowingly took part in that more&para;<br>dangerous crime. The same is true of an accomplice who&para;<br>knowingly joins in an armed drug transaction—regardless&para;<br>whether he was formerly indifferent or even resistant to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>crime’s commission.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>using firearms. The law does not, nor should it, care&para;<br>whether he participates with a happy heart or a sense of&para;<br>foreboding. Either way, he has the same culpability,&para;<br>because either way he has knowingly elected to aid in the&para;<br>commission of a peculiarly risky form of offense.&para;<br>A final, metaphorical way of making the point: By virtue&para;<br>of §924(c), using a firearm at a drug deal ups the ante. A&para;<br>would-be accomplice might decide to play at those perilous&para;<br>stakes. Or he might grasp that the better course is to fold&para;<br>his hand. What he should not expect is the capacity to&para;<br>hedge his bets, joining in a dangerous criminal scheme but&para;<br>evading its penalties by leaving use of the gun to someone&para;<br>else. Aiding and abetting law prevents that outcome, so&para;<br>long as the player knew the heightened stakes when he&para;<br>decided to stay in the game.&para;<br>The Government, for its part, thinks we take too strict a&para;<br>view of when a defendant charged with abetting a §924(c)&para;<br>violation must acquire that knowledge. As noted above,&para;<br>the Government recognizes that the accused accomplice&para;<br>must have “foreknowledge” of a gun’s presence. Brief for&para;<br>United States 38; see supra, at 13. But the Government&para;<br>views that standard as met whenever the accomplice,&para;<br>having learned of the firearm, continues any act of assisting the drug transaction. See Brief for United States 48.&para;<br>According to the Government, the jury should convict such&para;<br>a defendant even if he became aware of the gun only after&para;<br>he realistically could have opted out of the crime.&para;<br>But that approach, we think, would diminish too far the&para;<br>requirement that a defendant in a §924(c) prosecution&para;<br>must intend to further an armed drug deal. Assume,&para;<br>for example, that an accomplice agrees to participate in a&para;<br>drug sale on the express condition that no one brings a&para;<br>gun to the place of exchange. But just as the parties are&para;<br>making the trade, the accomplice notices that one of his&para;<br>confederates has a (poorly) concealed firearm in his jacket.&para;<br>The Government would convict the accomplice of aiding&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and abetting a §924(c) offense if he assists in completing&para;<br>the deal without incident, rather than running away or&para;<br>otherwise aborting the sale. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40. But&para;<br>behaving as the Government suggests might increase the&para;<br>risk of gun violence—to the accomplice himself, other&para;<br>participants, or bystanders; and conversely, finishing the&para;<br>sale might be the best or only way to avoid that danger.&para;<br>In such a circumstance, a jury is entitled to find that the&para;<br>defendant intended only a drug sale—that he never intended to facilitate, and so does not bear responsibility for,&para;<br>a drug deal carried out with a gun. A defendant manifests&para;<br>that greater intent, and incurs the greater liability of&para;<br>§924(c), when he chooses to participate in a drug transaction knowing it will involve a firearm; but he makes no&para;<br>such choice when that knowledge comes too late for him to&para;<br>be reasonably able to act upon it.10&para;<br>III&para;<br>Under these principles, the District Court erred in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 Contrary to the dissent’s view, see post, at 3–4, nothing in this&para;<br>holding changes the way the defenses of duress and necessity operate.&para;<br>Neither does our decision remotely deny that the “intent to undertake&para;<br>some act is . . . perfectly consistent with the motive of avoiding adverse&para;<br>consequences which would otherwise occur.” Post, at 5. Our holding is&para;<br>grounded in the distinctive intent standard for aiding and abetting&para;<br>someone else’s act—in the words of Judge Hand, that a defendant must&para;<br>not just “in some sort associate himself with the venture” (as seems to&para;<br>be good enough for the dissent), but also “participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about” and “seek by his action to make it&para;<br>succeed.” Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, 336 U. S. 613, 619 (1949)&para;<br>(quoting Peoni, 100 F. 2d, at 402). For the reasons just given, see&para;<br>supra, at 13, 15–16, we think that intent standard cannot be satisfied if&para;<br>a defendant charged with aiding and abetting a §924(c) offense learns&para;<br>of a gun only after he can realistically walk away—i.e., when he has no&para;<br>opportunity to decide whether “he wishes to bring about” (or make&para;<br>succeed) an armed drug transaction, rather than a simple drug crime.&para;<br>And because a defendant’s prior knowledge is part of the intent required to aid and abet a §924(c) offense, the burden to prove it resides&para;<br>with the Government.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>instructing the jury, because it did not explain that Rosemond needed advance knowledge of a firearm’s presence.&para;<br>Recall that the court stated that Rosemond was guilty of&para;<br>aiding and abetting if “(1) [he] knew his cohort used a&para;<br>firearm in the drug trafficking crime, and (2) [he] knowingly and actively participated in the drug trafficking&para;<br>crime.” App. 196. We agree with that instruction’s second&para;<br>half: As we have explained, active participation in a drug&para;<br>sale is sufficient for §924(c) liability (even if the conduct&para;<br>does not extend to the firearm), so long as the defendant&para;<br>had prior knowledge of the gun’s involvement. See supra,&para;<br>at 9, 11–13. The problem with the court’s instruction&para;<br>came in its description of that knowledge requirement. In&para;<br>telling the jury to consider merely whether Rosemond&para;<br>“knew his cohort used a firearm,” the court did not direct&para;<br>the jury to determine when Rosemond obtained the requisite knowledge. So, for example, the jury could have&para;<br>convicted even if Rosemond first learned of the gun when&para;<br>it was fired and he took no further action to advance the&para;<br>crime. For that reason, the Government itself describes&para;<br>the instruction’s first half as “potentially misleading,”&para;<br>candidly explaining that “it would have been clearer to&para;<br>say” that Rosemond had to know that his confederate&para;<br>“ ‘ would use’ [a firearm] or something . . . that makes&para;<br>absolutely clear that you [need] foreknowledge.” Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 48–49. We agree with that view, and then some:&para;<br>The court’s statement failed to convey that Rosemond had&para;<br>to have advance knowledge, of the kind we have described,&para;<br>that a confederate would be armed. See supra, at 13,&para;<br>15–16.&para;<br>The Government contends that this problematic instruction looks more accurate when viewed in context. In&para;<br>particular, the Government points to the District Court’s&para;<br>prefatory “umbrella instruction” that to aid or abet a&para;<br>crime, a defendant must “willfully and knowingly seek[ ]&para;<br>by some act to help make the crime succeed.” App. 196;&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Brief for United States 49. That statement, the Government rightly notes, “mirrors” Judge Hand’s classic formulation. Tr. of Oral Arg. 33; see supra, at 11. But the&para;<br>statement is also pitched at a high level of generality.&para;<br>Immediately afterward, the District Court provided the&para;<br>jury with the two-pronged test noted above—thus indicating how the broad principle should apply to the specific&para;<br>charge of abetting a §924(c) offense. We therefore do not&para;<br>see how the “umbrella” statement could have cured the&para;<br>court’s error. Indeed, a different contextual feature of the&para;<br>case would only have amplified that mistake. As earlier&para;<br>described, the prosecutor asserted in closing argument&para;<br>that the court’s test was easily satisfied because “a person&para;<br>cannot be present and active at a drug deal when shots are&para;<br>fired and not know their cohort is using a gun.” App. 158;&para;<br>see supra, at 3–4. The prosecutor thus invited the jury to&para;<br>convict Rosemond even if he first learned of the gun as&para;<br>it was discharged, and no matter what he did afterward.&para;<br>Once again, then, the message to the jury was that it need&para;<br>not find advance knowledge—exactly what we (and for&para;<br>that matter the Government) have said is required.&para;<br>We send this case back to the Tenth Circuit to consider&para;<br>the appropriate consequence, if any, of the District Court’s&para;<br>error. The Government makes two arguments relevant to&para;<br>that inquiry. First, it contends that Rosemond failed to&para;<br>object specifically to the part of the trial court’s instructions we have found wanting; thus, the Government asserts, a plain-error standard should apply to his claim.&para;<br>See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b); Johnson v. United States,&para;<br>520 U. S. 461, 465–467 (1997). Second, the Government&para;<br>argues that any error in the court’s aiding and abetting&para;<br>instruction was harmless, because the jury must have&para;<br>found (based on another part of its verdict, not discussed&para;<br>here) that Rosemond himself fired the gun. Those claims&para;<br>were not raised or addressed below, and we see no special&para;<br>reason to decide them in the first instance. See Travelers&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U.

Prominent among these cases is Nye &amp; Nissen v.&para;<br>United States, 336 U. S. 613 (1949), which the Court&para;<br>quotes. See ante, at 16, n. 10. In that case, the Court,&para;<br>quoting Judge Learned Hand’s formulation in United&para;<br>States v. Peoni, 100 F. 2d 401 (CA2 1938), said that an&para;<br>aider and abettor must “ ‘participate in [the crime] as in&para;<br>something that he wishes to bring about, [and] seek by his&para;<br>action to make it succeed.’ ” 336 U.

But just as the parties are&para;<br>making the trade, the accomplice notices that one of&para;<br>his confederates has a (poorly) concealed firearm in&para;<br>his jacket.” Ante, at 15.&para;<br>If the accomplice, despite spotting the gun, continues to&para;<br>assist in the completion of the drug sale, has the accom­&para;<br>plice aided and abetted the commission of a violation of&para;<br>§924(c)?&para;<br>The Court’s answer is “it depends.” Walking away, the&para;<br>Court observes, “might increase the risk of gun violence—&para;<br>to the accomplice himself, other participants, or bystand­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>ers; and conversely, finishing the sale might be the best or&para;<br>only way to avoid the danger.” Ante, at 16. Moreover—&para;<br>and this is where the seriously misguided step occurs—the&para;<br>Court says that if the risk of walking away exceeds (by&para;<br>some unspecified degree) the risk created by completing&para;<br>the sale and if the alleged aider and abettor chooses to&para;<br>continue for that reason, the alleged aider and abettor&para;<br>lacks the mens rea required for conviction. See ante, at 16,&para;<br>n. 10.&para;<br>What the Court has done is to convert what has up to&para;<br>now been an affirmative defense into a part of the re­&para;<br>quired mens rea, and this step has very important concep­&para;<br>tual and practical consequences. It fundamentally alters&para;<br>the prior understanding of mental states that form the&para;<br>foundation of substantive criminal law, and it places a&para;<br>strange and difficult burden on the prosecution.&para;<br>That the Court has taken a radical step can be seen by&para;<br>comparing what the Court now holds with the traditional&para;<br>defense of necessity. That defense excuses a violation of&para;<br>law if “the harm which will result from compliance with&para;<br>the law is greater than that which will result from viola­&para;<br>tion of it.” 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law §10.1,&para;<br>p. 116 (2003) (hereinafter LaFave).2 This is almost exactly&para;<br>the balance-of-risks calculus adopted by the Court, but&para;<br>under the traditional approach necessity is an affirmative&para;<br>defense. See, e.g., United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394,&para;<br>416 (1980). Necessity and the closely related defense of&para;<br>duress are affirmative defenses because they almost invar­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Traditionally,&para;<br>&para;<br>the defense of necessity was employed when natural&para;<br>forces created the situation justifying non-compliance; when the situa­&para;<br>tion was the product of human action, duress was the appropriate&para;<br>defense. 2 LaFave §10.1(a), at 116. But “[m]odern cases have tended to&para;<br>blur the distinction between” these two defenses, United States v.&para;<br>Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 410 (1980), and “it would doubtless be possible to&para;<br>treat [duress] as a branch of the law of necessity,” 2 LaFave §10.1(b), at&para;<br>121.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>iably do not negate the mens rea necessary to incur crimi­&para;<br>nal liability. See 2 LaFave §10.1(a), at 118 (“The rationale&para;<br>of the necessity defense is not that a person, when faced&para;<br>with the pressure of circumstances of nature, lacks the&para;<br>mental element which the crime in question requires”);&para;<br>id., §9.7(a), at 73 (same for duress).&para;<br>This Court has made clear that, except in narrow cir­&para;<br>cumstances, necessity and duress do not negate the mens&para;<br>rea required for conviction. In Dixon v. United States, 548&para;<br>U. S. 1 (2006), the defendant was charged with “knowingly” and “willfully” committing certain criminal acts, but&para;<br>she claimed that she committed the acts only because her&para;<br>boyfriend had threatened to kill her or hurt her daughters&para;<br>if she did not do so. Id., at 4. She contended that she&para;<br>could not “have formed the necessary mens rea for these&para;<br>crimes because she did not freely choose to commit the&para;<br>acts in question,” but we rejected that argument, explain­&para;<br>ing that “[t]he duress defense, like the defense of necessity&para;<br>. . . , may excuse conduct that would otherwise be punish­&para;<br>able, but the existence of duress normally does not contro­&para;<br>vert any of the elements of the offense itself.” Id., at 6. In&para;<br>a footnote, we suggested one situation in which the prose­&para;<br>cution might be required to disprove duress, namely,&para;<br>where a particular crime demands proof that the accused&para;<br>acted “maliciously,” which is to say “without justification&para;<br>or excuse.” Ibid., n. 4 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>The Court justifies its holding on the ground that the&para;<br>mens rea standard articulated in Nye &amp; Nissen also falls&para;<br>within an exception to the general rule that proof of neces­&para;<br>sity or duress does not negate mens rea. Ante, at 16, n. 10.&para;<br>But the Court, having refrained on pages 11–12 of its&para;<br>opinion from deciding whether aiding and abetting re­&para;<br>quires purposeful, as opposed to knowing, conduct, quickly&para;<br>and without explanation jettisons the “knowing” standard&para;<br>and concludes that purposeful conduct is needed. This is a&para;<br>critical move because if it is enough for an alleged aider&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>and abettor simply to know that his confederate is carry­&para;<br>ing a gun, then the alleged aider and abettor in the&para;<br>Court’s hypothetical case (who spots the gun on the con­&para;<br>federate’s person) unquestionably had the mens rea needed&para;<br>for conviction.&para;<br>But even accepting the Nye &amp; Nissen standard as the&para;<br>exclusive means of proving the required mens rea, the&para;<br>Court’s analysis is still quite wrong. Under the Nye &amp;&para;<br>Nissen standard, the Government must simply prove that&para;<br>a defendant had as his conscious object that the hypothet­&para;<br>ical drug sale (which, as the defendant knew, included the&para;<br>carrying of a gun by one of the participants) go forward to&para;<br>completion. See Nye &amp; Nissen, 336 U. S., at 619. Such&para;<br>intent is perfectly consistent with facts supporting a ne­&para;<br>cessity or duress defense. A person can certainly intend&para;<br>the success of a criminal enterprise that he aids on the&para;<br>belief that doing so will give rise to a lesser evil than his&para;<br>refusal to participate would bring about.&para;<br>The Court confuses two fundamentally distinct concepts:&para;<br>intent and motive. It seems to assume that, if a defend­&para;<br>ant’s motive in aiding a criminal venture is to avoid some&para;<br>greater evil, he does not have the intent that the venture&para;<br>succeed. But the intent to undertake some act is of course&para;<br>perfectly consistent with the motive of avoiding adverse&para;<br>consequences which would otherwise occur. We can all&para;<br>testify to this from our daily experience. People wake up,&para;<br>go to work, balance their checkbooks, shop for groceries—&para;<br>and yes, commit crimes—because they believe something&para;<br>bad will happen if they do not do these things, not because&para;<br>the deepest desire of their heart is to do them. A person&para;<br>may only go to work in the morning to keep his or her&para;<br>family from destitution; that does not mean he or she does&para;<br>not intend to put in a full day’s work. In the same way,&para;<br>the fact that a defendant carries out a crime because he&para;<br>feels he must do so on pain of terrible consequences does&para;<br>not mean he does not intend to carry out the crime. When&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Jean Valjean stole a loaf of bread to feed his starving&para;<br>family, he certainly intended to commit theft; the fact&para;<br>that, had he been living in America today, he may have&para;<br>pleaded necessity as a defense does not change that fact.&para;<br>See V. Hugo, Les Misérables 54 (Fall River Press ed.&para;<br>2012).&para;<br>Common-law commentators recognized this elementary&para;<br>distinction between intent and motive. As Sir James&para;<br>FitzJames Stephen explains, if “A puts a loaded pistol to&para;<br>B’s temple and shoots B through the head deliberately,&para;<br>. . . . [i]t is obvious that in every such case the intention of&para;<br>A must be to kill B.” 2 A History of the Criminal Law of&para;<br>England 110–111 (1883). This fact “throws no light what­&para;<br>ever on A’s motives for killing B. They may have been&para;<br>infinitely various. . . . The motive may have been a desire&para;<br>for revenge, or a desire for plunder, or a wish on A’s part&para;<br>to defend himself against an attack by B, . . . or to put a&para;<br>man already mortally wounded out of his agony.” Id., at&para;<br>111. “In all these cases the intention is the same, but the&para;<br>motives are different, and in all the intention may remain&para;<br>unchanged from first to last whilst the motives may vary&para;<br>from moment to moment.” Ibid.&para;<br>Unsurprisingly, our cases have recognized that a lawful&para;<br>motive (such as necessity, duress, or self-defense) is con­&para;<br>sistent with the mens rea necessary to satisfy a require­&para;<br>ment of intent. In Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228 (1987),&para;<br>we considered whether due process permitted the State of&para;<br>Ohio to place the burden of proving self-defense on a de­&para;<br>fendant charged with aggravated murder. Under the Ohio&para;<br>statute, aggravated murder consisted of “purposely, and&para;<br>with prior calculation and design, caus[ing] the death of&para;<br>another.” Id., at 230 (alteration in original; internal quo­&para;<br>tation marks omitted). Martin pleaded self-defense, which&para;<br>required her to prove that (1) she was “not at fault in&para;<br>creating the situation giving rise to the argument” with&para;<br>the victim, (2) she “had an honest belief that she was in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>imminent danger of death or great bodily harm, and that&para;<br>her only means of escape from such danger was in the use&para;<br>of . . . force,” and (3) she “did not violate any duty to re­&para;<br>treat or avoid danger.” Ibid. Martin argued that due&para;<br>process did not permit the State to impose the burden of&para;<br>proving self-defense on her, because proving self-defense&para;<br>would necessarily negate the elements of aggravated&para;<br>murder, which the State was required to prove beyond a&para;<br>reasonable doubt. We disagreed, explaining that the&para;<br>elements which the State was required to prove to convict&para;<br>Martin were not the same as the elements which Martin&para;<br>was required to prove to prevail on her self-defense theory.&para;<br>Id., at 233. By so holding, we recognized that a defend­&para;<br>ant’s purpose to kill another is not incompatible with that&para;<br>defendant’s “honest belief that she was in imminent dan­&para;<br>ger of death or great bodily harm” and that her use of force&para;<br>was necessary to preserve her life. Id., at 230. In other&para;<br>words, the fact that a defendant intends to kill another&para;<br>only to avert mortal peril does not mean that the defend­&para;<br>ant does not intend to kill.&para;<br>That principle plays out in a wide variety of cases.&para;<br>United States v. Leal-Cruz, 431 F. 3d 667 (CA9 2005),&para;<br>provides a good example. There, the Ninth Circuit had&para;<br>to decide whether a defendant could constitutionally be&para;<br>required to bear the burden of proving duress as a defense&para;<br>to conviction under 8 U. S. C. §1326 for attempted illegal&para;<br>reentry into the United States. Leal-Cruz pleaded duress,&para;<br>testifying that he entered the United States only to escape&para;<br>the deadly threat posed by abusive Mexican police officers&para;<br>who were chasing him. 431 F. 3d, at 669. The Ninth&para;<br>Circuit had earlier held that the mens rea required for&para;<br>conviction for attempted illegal reentry was “purpose, i.e.,&para;<br>conscious desire, to reenter the United States.” Id., at&para;<br>671. The Court of Appeals nevertheless found that the&para;<br>Constitution permitted imposition of the burden of proving&para;<br>duress on Leal-Cruz, because proving duress did not re­&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ROSEMOND v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>quire him to prove that he had not purposely entered the&para;<br>United States. As the Ninth Circuit explained, duress and&para;<br>the mens rea requirement of intent did not overlap be­&para;<br>cause Leal-Cruz “had the ‘conscious desire’ to enter the&para;<br>country, even if the act of crossing the border was done to&para;<br>escape harm.” Id., at 673.&para;<br>Thus, it seems inarguable to me that the existence of&para;<br>the purpose or intent to carry out a crime is perfectly&para;<br>compatible with facts giving rise to a necessity or duress&para;<br>defense. Once that proposition is established, the Court’s&para;<br>error is readily apparent. The Court requires the Gov­&para;<br>ernment to prove that a defendant in Rosemond’s situa­&para;<br>tion could have walked away without risking harm greater&para;<br>than he would cause by continuing with the crime—&para;<br>circumstances that traditionally would support a necessity&para;<br>or duress defense. It imposes this requirement on the&para;<br>Government despite the fact that such dangerous circum­&para;<br>stances simply do not bear on whether the defendant&para;<br>intends the §924(c) offense to succeed, as (on the Court’s&para;<br>reading) is required for aiding and abetting liability.&para;<br>The usual rule that a defendant bears the burden of&para;<br>proving affirmative defenses is justified by a compelling,&para;<br>commonsense intuition: “[W]here the facts with regard to&para;<br>an issue lie peculiarly in the knowledge of a party, that&para;<br>party is best situated to bear the burden of proof.” Smith&para;<br>v. United States, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6–7)&para;<br>(quoting Dixon, 548 U. S., at 9; alteration in original&para;<br>and internal quotation marks omitted). By abandoning&para;<br>that rule in cases involving aiding and abetting of §924(c)&para;<br>offenses, the Court creates a perverse arrangement&para;<br>whereby the prosecution must prove something that is&para;<br>peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant. Imag­&para;<br>ine that A aids B in committing a §924(c) offense and&para;<br>claims that he only learned of the gun once the crime had&para;<br>begun. If A had the burden of proof, he might testify that&para;<br>B was a hothead who had previously shot others who had&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>crossed him. But under the Court’s rule, the prosecution,&para;<br>in order to show the intent needed to convict A as an aider&para;<br>and abettor, presumably has the burden of proving that B&para;<br>was not such a person and that A did not believe him to&para;<br>be. How is the prosecution to do this? By offering testi­&para;<br>mony by B’s friends and associates regarding his peaceful&para;<br>and easygoing nature? By introducing entries from A’s&para;<br>diary in which he reflects on the sense of safety he feels&para;<br>when carrying out criminal enterprises in B’s company?&para;<br>Furthermore, even if B were a hothead and A knew him to&para;<br>be such, A would presumably only be entitled to escape&para;<br>liability if he continued with the offense because of his fear&para;<br>of B’s reaction if he walked away. Under the Court’s rule,&para;<br>it is up to the Government to prove that A’s continued&para;<br>participation was not on account of his fear of B—but how?&para;<br>By introducing footage of a convenient security camera&para;<br>demonstrating that A’s eyes were not wide with fear, nor&para;<br>his breathing rapid?&para;<br>The Court’s rule breaks with the common-law tradition&para;<br>and our case law. It also makes no sense. I respectfully&para;<br>dissent from that portion of the Court’s opinion which&para;<br>places on the Government the burden of proving that the&para;<br>alleged aider and abettor of a §924(c) offense had what the&para;<br>Court terms “a realistic opportunity” to refrain from en­&para;<br>gaging in the conduct at issue.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
