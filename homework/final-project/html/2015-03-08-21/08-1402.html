SMITH&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1402. Argued January 20, 2010—Decided March 30, 2010&para;<br>Criminal defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to trial by an im&para;<br>partial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community. See&para;<br>Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522. To establish a prima facie viola&para;<br>tion of the fair-cross-section requirement, a defendant must prove&para;<br>that: (1) a group qualifying as “distinctive” (2) is not fairly and rea&para;<br>sonably represented in jury venires, and (3) “systematic exclusion” in&para;<br>the jury-selection process accounts for the underrepresentation.&para;<br>Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357, 364.&para;<br>At voir dire in the Kent County Circuit Court trial of respondent&para;<br>Smith, an African-American, the venire panel included between 60&para;<br>and 100 individuals, only 3 of whom, at most, were African-American.&para;<br>At that time, African-Americans constituted 7.28% of the County’s&para;<br>jury-eligible population, and 6% of the pool from which potential ju&para;<br>rors were drawn. The court rejected Smith’s objection to the panel’s&para;<br>racial composition, an all-white jury convicted him of second-degree&para;<br>murder and felony firearm possession, and the court sentenced him&para;<br>to life in prison with the possibility of parole.&para;<br>On order of the Michigan Court of Appeals, the trial court con&para;<br>ducted an evidentiary hearing on Smith’s fair-cross-section claim.&para;<br>The evidence at the hearing showed, inter alia, that under the juror&para;<br>assignment order in effect when Smith’s jury was empaneled, the&para;<br>County assigned prospective jurors first to local district courts, and,&para;<br>only after filling local needs, made remaining persons available to the&para;<br>countywide Circuit Court, which heard felony cases like Smith’s.&para;<br>Smith calls this procedure “siphoning.” The month after Smith’s voir&para;<br>dire, however, the County reversed course and adopted a CircuitCourt-first assignment order. It did so based on the belief that the&para;<br>district courts took most of the minority jurors, leaving the Circuit&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. SMITH&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Court with a jury pool that did not represent the entire County. The&para;<br>trial court noted two means of measuring the underrepresentation of&para;<br>African-Americans on Circuit Court venires. First, the court de&para;<br>scribed the “absolute disparity” test, under which the percentage of&para;<br>African-Americans in the jury pool (6%) is subtracted from the per&para;<br>centage of African-Americans in the local, jury-eligible population&para;<br>(7.28%). According to this measure, African-Americans were under&para;<br>represented by 1.28%. Next, the court set out the “comparative dis&para;<br>parity” test, under which the absolute disparity (1.28%) is divided by&para;<br>the percentage of African-Americans in the jury-eligible population&para;<br>(7.28%). The quotient (18%) indicated that, on average, AfricanAmericans were 18% less likely, when compared to the overall jury&para;<br>eligible population, to be on the jury-service list. In the 11 months&para;<br>after Kent County discontinued the district-court-first assignment&para;<br>policy, the comparative disparity, on average, dropped from 18% to&para;<br>15.1%. The hearing convinced the trial court that African-Americans&para;<br>were underrepresented on Circuit Court venires. But Smith’s evi&para;<br>dence, the trial court held, was insufficient to prove that the juror&para;<br>assignment order, or any other part of the jury-selection process, had&para;<br>systematically excluded African-Americans. The court therefore re&para;<br>jected Smith’s fair-cross-section claim.&para;<br>The state intermediate appellate court reversed and ordered a new&para;<br>trial with jurors selected under the Circuit-Court-first assignment&para;<br>order. Reversing in turn, the Michigan Supreme Court concluded&para;<br>that Smith had not established a prima facie Sixth Amendment vio&para;<br>lation. This Court, the state High Court observed, has specified no&para;<br>preferred method for measuring whether representation of a distinc&para;<br>tive group in the jury pool is fair and reasonable. The court noted&para;<br>that lower federal courts had applied three tests: the absolute and&para;<br>comparative disparity tests and a standard deviation test. Adopting&para;<br>a case-by-case approach allowing consideration of all three means of&para;<br>measuring underrepresentation, the court found that Smith had&para;<br>failed to establish a legally significant disparity under any measure&para;<br>ment. Nevertheless giving Smith the benefit of the doubt on under&para;<br>representation, the court determined that he had not shown system&para;<br>atic exclusion.&para;<br>Smith then filed a federal habeas petition. The Antiterrorism and&para;<br>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) prohibits federal ha&para;<br>beas relief unless the state court’s adjudication “resulted in a decision&para;<br>that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,&para;<br>clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court&para;<br>of the United States,” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1), or “resulted in a deci&para;<br>sion that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in&para;<br>light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>§2254(d)(2). Finding no infirmity in the Michigan Supreme Court’s&para;<br>decision when assessed under AEDPA’s standards, the District Court&para;<br>dismissed Smith’s petition. The Sixth Circuit reversed. The Court of&para;<br>Appeals ruled, first, that courts should use the comparative disparity&para;<br>test to measure underrepresentation where, as here, the allegedly ex&para;<br>cluded group is small. The court then held that Smith’s comparative&para;<br>disparity statistics demonstrated that African-Americans’ represen&para;<br>tation in County Circuit Court venires was unfair and unreasonable.&para;<br>It next stated that Smith had shown systematic exclusion. In accord&para;<br>with the Michigan intermediate appellate court, the Sixth Circuit be&para;<br>lieved that the district-court-first assignment order significantly re&para;<br>duced the number of African-Americans available for Circuit Court&para;<br>venires. Smith was entitled to relief, the Sixth Circuit concluded, be&para;<br>cause no important state interest supported the district-court-first al&para;<br>location system.&para;<br>Held: The Sixth Circuit erred in ruling that the Michigan Supreme&para;<br>Court’s decision “involv[ed] an unreasonable application o[f] clearly&para;<br>established Federal law,” §2254(d)(1). Duren hardly establishes—no&para;<br>less “clearly” so—that Smith was denied his Sixth Amendment right&para;<br>to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the commu&para;<br>nity. Pp. 10–16.&para;<br>(a) The Duren defendant readily met all three parts of the Court’s&para;<br>prima facie test when he complained of the dearth of women in a&para;<br>county’s jury pool. First, he showed that women in the county were&para;<br>both “numerous and distinct from men.” 439 U. S., at 364. Second,&para;<br>to establish underrepresentation, he proved that women were 54% of&para;<br>the jury-eligible population, but accounted for only 26.7% of those&para;<br>summoned for jury service, and only 14.5% of those on the postsum&para;<br>mons weekly venires from which jurors were drawn. Id., at 364–366.&para;<br>Finally, to show the “systematic” cause of the underrepresentation,&para;<br>he pointed to Missouri’s law permitting any woman to opt out of jury&para;<br>service and to the manner in which the county administered that&para;<br>law. This Court noted that “appropriately tailored” hardship exemp&para;<br>tions would likely survive a fair-cross-section challenge if justified by&para;<br>an important state interest, id., at 370, but concluded that no such&para;<br>interest could justify the exemption for each and every woman, id., at&para;<br>369–370. Pp. 10–11.&para;<br>(b) Neither Duren nor any other decision of this Court specifies the&para;<br>method or test courts must use to measure underrepresentation.&para;<br>Each of the three methods employed or identified by the courts be&para;<br>low—absolute disparity, comparative disparity, and standard devia&para;<br>tion—is imperfect. Absolute disparity and comparative disparity&para;<br>measurements can be misleading where, as here, members of the dis&para;<br>tinctive group compose only a small percentage of the community’s&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. SMITH&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>jury-eligible population. And it appears that no court has relied ex&para;<br>clusively on a standard deviation analysis. Even absent AEDPA’s&para;<br>constraint, this Court would have no cause to take sides here on the&para;<br>appropriate method or methods for measuring underrepresentation.&para;<br>Although the Michigan Supreme Court concluded that Smith’s statis&para;<br>tical evidence failed to establish a legally significant disparity under&para;<br>either the absolute or comparative disparity tests, the court neverthe&para;<br>less gave Smith the benefit of the doubt on underrepresentation in&para;<br>order to reach the issue ultimately dispositive in Duren: To the extent&para;<br>underrepresentation existed, was it due to “systematic exclusion”?&para;<br>See Duren, 439 U. S., at 364. Pp. 11–13.&para;<br>(c) Smith’s evidence gave the Michigan Supreme Court little reason&para;<br>to conclude that the district-court-first assignment order had any&para;<br>significant effect on the representation of African-Americans on Cir&para;<br>cuit Court venires. Although the record established that some&para;<br>County officials believed that the assignment order created racial&para;<br>disparities, and the County reversed the order in response, the belief&para;<br>was not substantiated by Smith’s evidence. He introduced no evi&para;<br>dence that African-Americans were underrepresented on the Circuit&para;<br>Court’s venires in significantly higher percentages than on the Dis&para;<br>trict Court for Grand Rapids, which had the County’s largest AfricanAmerican population. He did not address whether Grand Rapids had&para;<br>more need for jurors per capita than any other district in Kent&para;<br>County. And he did not compare the African-American representa&para;<br>tion levels on Circuit Court venires with those on the Federal District&para;<br>Court venires for the same region. See Duren, 439 U. S., at 367,&para;<br>n. 25. Smith’s best evidence of systematic exclusion was the decline&para;<br>in comparative underrepresentation, from 18 to 15.1%, after Kent&para;<br>County reversed its assignment order. But that evidence indicated&para;<br>no large change and was, in any event, insufficient to prove that the&para;<br>original assignment order had a significantly adverse impact on the&para;<br>representation of African-Americans on Circuit Court venires. Pp.&para;<br>13–14.&para;<br>(d) In addition to renewing his “siphoning” argument, Smith urges&para;<br>that a laundry list of factors—e.g., the County’s practice of excusing&para;<br>prospective jurors without adequate proof of alleged hardship, and&para;<br>the refusal of County police to enforce orders for prospective jurors to&para;<br>appear—combined to reduce systematically the number of AfricanAmericans appearing on jury lists. No “clearly established” prece&para;<br>dent of this Court supports Smith’s claim. Smith urges that one sen&para;<br>tence in Duren, 439 U. S., at 368–369, places the burden of proving&para;<br>causation on the State. But Smith clipped that sentence from its con&para;<br>text: The sentence does not concern the demonstration of a prima face&para;<br>case; instead, it speaks to what the State might show to rebut the de&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>fendant’s prima facie case. The Michigan Supreme Court was there&para;<br>fore far from “unreasonable,” §2254(d)(1), in concluding that Duren&para;<br>first and foremost required Smith himself to show that the underrep&para;<br>resentation complained of was due to systematic exclusion. This&para;<br>Court, furthermore, has never “clearly established” that jury&para;<br>selection-process features of the kind on Smith’s list can give rise to a&para;<br>fair-cross-section claim. Rather, the Taylor Court “recognized broad&para;<br>discretion in the States” to “prescribe relevant qualifications for their&para;<br>jurors and to provide reasonable exemptions.” 419 U. S., at 537–538.&para;<br>And in Duren, the Court understood that hardship exemptions re&para;<br>sembling those Smith assails might well “survive a fair-cross-section&para;<br>challenge.” 439 U.

Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522 (1975). The ques&para;<br>tion presented in this case is whether that right was ac&para;<br>corded to respondent Diapolis Smith, an African-American&para;<br>convicted of second-degree murder by an all-white jury in&para;<br>Kent County, Michigan in 1993. At the time of Smith’s&para;<br>trial, African-Americans constituted 7.28% of Kent&para;<br>County’s jury-eligible population, and 6% of the pool from&para;<br>which potential jurors were drawn.&para;<br>In Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357 (1979), this Court&para;<br>described three showings a criminal defendant must make&para;<br>to establish a prima facie violation of the Sixth Amend&para;<br>ment’s fair-cross-section requirement. He or she must&para;<br>show: “(1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a ‘dis&para;<br>tinctive’ group in the community; (2) that the representa&para;<br>tion of this group in venires from which juries are selected&para;<br>is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of&para;<br>such persons in the community; and (3) that this under&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. SMITH&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>representation is due to systematic exclusion of the group&para;<br>in the jury-selection process.” Id., at 364. The first show&para;<br>ing is, in most cases, easily made; the second and third are&para;<br>more likely to generate controversy.&para;<br>The defendant in Duren readily met all three measures.&para;<br>He complained of the dearth of women in the Jackson&para;<br>County, Missouri, jury pool. To establish underrepresen&para;<br>tation, he proved that women were 54% of the jury-eligible&para;<br>population, but accounted for only 26.7% of the persons&para;<br>summoned for jury service, and only 14.5% of the persons&para;<br>on the postsummons weekly venires from which jurors&para;<br>were drawn. To show the “systematic” cause of the under&para;<br>representation, Duren pointed to Missouri’s law exempt&para;<br>ing women from jury service, and to the manner in which&para;<br>Jackson County administered the exemption. Concluding&para;<br>that no significant state interest could justify Missouri’s&para;<br>explicitly gender-based exemption, this Court held the&para;<br>law, as implemented in Jackson County, violative of the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment’s fair-cross-section requirement.&para;<br>We here review the decision of the United States Court&para;<br>of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit holding that Smith “sat&para;<br>isf[ied] the prima facie test established by Duren,” and&para;<br>granting him habeas corpus relief, i.e., release from im&para;<br>prisonment absent a new trial commenced within 180 days&para;<br>of the Court of Appeals’ order. 543 F. 3d 326, 336 (2008).&para;<br>Despite marked differences between Smith’s case and&para;<br>Duren’s, and a cogent Michigan Supreme Court decision&para;<br>holding that Smith “ha[d] not shown . . . systematic exclu&para;<br>sion,” People v. Smith, 463 Mich. 199, 205, 615 N. W. 2d 1,&para;<br>3 (2000), the Sixth Circuit found the matter settled. Cog&para;<br>nizant of the restrictions Congress placed on federal ha&para;<br>beas review of state-court convictions, the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals considered that a decision contrary to its own would&para;<br>“involv[e] an unreasonable application o[f] clearly estab&para;<br>lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court&para;<br>of the United States,” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). 543 F. 3d,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>at 335.&para;<br>The Sixth Circuit erred in so ruling. No decision of this&para;<br>Court “clearly establishe[s]” Smith’s entitlement to fed&para;<br>eral-court relief. According to the Sixth Circuit, Smith&para;<br>had demonstrated that a Kent County prospective-juror&para;<br>assignment procedure, which Smith calls “siphoning,”&para;<br>“systematic[ally] exclu[ded]” African-Americans. Under&para;<br>this procedure, Kent County assigned prospective jurors&para;<br>first to local district courts, and, only after filling local&para;<br>needs, made remaining persons available to the county&para;<br>wide Circuit Court, which heard felony cases like Smith’s.&para;<br>The Michigan Supreme Court, however, had rejected&para;<br>Smith’s “siphoning” plea for lack of proof that the assign&para;<br>ment procedure caused underrepresentation. Smith, 463&para;<br>Mich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. As that determination&para;<br>was not at all unreasonable, the Sixth Circuit had no&para;<br>warrant to disturb it. See §2254(d)(2).&para;<br>In addition to renewal of his “siphoning” argument,&para;<br>Smith here urges that a host of factors combined to reduce&para;<br>systematically the number of African-Americans appear&para;<br>ing on Kent County jury lists, for example, the Kent&para;<br>County court’s practice of excusing people without ade&para;<br>quate proof of alleged hardship, and the refusal of Kent&para;<br>County police to enforce orders for prospective jurors to&para;<br>appear. Brief for Respondent 53–54. Our decisions do not&para;<br>address factors of the kind Smith urges. We have cau&para;<br>tioned, however, that “[t]he fair-cross-section principle&para;<br>must have much leeway in application.” Taylor, 419 U. S.,&para;<br>at 537–538; see id., at 537 (Court’s holding that Sixth&para;<br>Amendment is violated by systematic exclusion of women&para;<br>from jury service “does not augur or authorize the fashion&para;<br>ing of detailed jury-selection codes by federal courts.”).&para;<br>I&para;<br>A&para;<br>On November 7, 1991, Christopher Rumbley was shot&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. SMITH&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and killed during a bar brawl in Grand Rapids, Michigan.&para;<br>The bar was crowded at the time of the brawl, with 200-to&para;<br>300 people on the premises. All patrons of the bar were&para;<br>African-American. The State charged Smith with the&para;<br>murder in Kent County Circuit Court.&para;<br>Voir dire for Smith’s trial took place in September 1993.&para;<br>The venire panel included between 60 and 100 individuals.&para;<br>The parties agree that, at most, three venire members&para;<br>were African-American. Smith unsuccessfully objected to&para;<br>the composition of the venire panel.&para;<br>Smith’s case proceeded to trial before an all-white jury.&para;<br>The case for the prosecution turned on the identity of the&para;<br>man who shot Rumbley. Thirty-seven witnesses from the&para;<br>bar, including Smith, testified at the trial. Of those, two&para;<br>testified that Smith fired the gun. Five testified that the&para;<br>shooter was not Smith, and the remainder made no identi&para;<br>fications of the shooter. The jury convicted Smith of sec&para;<br>ond-degree murder and possession of a firearm during a&para;<br>felony, and the court sentenced him to life imprisonment&para;<br>with the possibility of parole.&para;<br>B&para;<br>On first appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals ordered&para;<br>the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on&para;<br>Smith’s fair-cross-section claim. The hearing occurred in&para;<br>early 1998. Smith’s evidence showed that Grand Rapids,&para;<br>the largest city in Kent County, was home to roughly 37%&para;<br>of Kent County’s population, and to 85% of its AfricanAmerican residents. Felony charges in Kent County were&para;<br>tried in a sole Circuit Court. Misdemeanors were prose&para;<br>cuted in 12 district courts, each covering a discrete geo&para;<br>graphical area. To fill the courts’ venires, Kent County&para;<br>sent questionnaires to prospective jurors. The Circuit&para;<br>Court Administrator testified that about 5% of the forms&para;<br>were returned as undeliverable, and another 15 to 20%&para;<br>were not answered. App. 13a. From the pool of prospec&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tive jurors who completed questionnaires, the County&para;<br>granted requests for hardship exemptions, e.g., for lack of&para;<br>transportation or child care. Id., at 21a. Kent County&para;<br>then assigned nonexempt prospective jurors to their local&para;<br>district courts’ venires. After filling the district courts’&para;<br>needs, the County assigned the remaining prospective&para;<br>jurors to the Circuit Court’s panels. Id., at 20a, 22a.&para;<br>The month after voir dire for Smith’s trial, Kent County&para;<br>reversed the assignment order. It did so, according to the&para;<br>Circuit Court Administrator, based on “[t]he belief . . . that&para;<br>the respective districts essentially swallowed up most of&para;<br>the minority jurors,” leaving the Circuit Court with a jury&para;<br>pool that “did not represent the entire county.” Id., at 22a.&para;<br>The Jury Minority Representation Committee, its co-chair&para;<br>testified, held the same view concerning the impact of&para;<br>choosing district court jurors first and not returning un&para;<br>used persons to the pool available for Circuit Court selec&para;<br>tions. Id., at 64a–65a.&para;<br>The trial court considered two means of measuring the&para;<br>extent of underrepresentation of African-Americans on&para;<br>Circuit Court venires: “absolute disparity” and “compara&para;<br>tive disparity.” “Absolute disparity” is determined by&para;<br>subtracting the percentage of African-Americans in the&para;<br>jury pool (here, 6% in the six months leading up to Smith’s&para;<br>trial) from the percentage of African-Americans in the&para;<br>local, jury-eligible population (here, 7.28%). By an abso&para;<br>lute disparity measure, therefore, African-Americans were&para;<br>underrepresented by 1.28%. “Comparative disparity” is&para;<br>determined by dividing the absolute disparity (here,&para;<br>1.28%) by the group’s representation in the jury-eligible&para;<br>population (here, 7.28%).&para;<br>The quotient (here, 18%),&para;<br>showed that, in the six months prior to Smith’s trial,&para;<br>African-Americans were, on average, 18% less likely, when&para;<br>compared to the overall jury-eligible population, to be on&para;<br>the jury-service list. App. to Pet. for Cert. 215a.&para;<br>Isolating the month Smith’s jury was selected, Smith’s&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. SMITH&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>statistics expert estimated that the comparative disparity&para;<br>was 34.8%. App. 181a. In the 11 months after Kent&para;<br>County discontinued the district-court-first assignment&para;<br>policy, the comparative disparity, on average, dropped&para;<br>from 18% to 15.1%. Id., at 102a–103a, 113a.&para;<br>Smith also introduced the testimony of an expert in&para;<br>demographics and economics, who tied the underrepresen&para;<br>tation to social and economic factors. In Kent County, the&para;<br>expert explained, these forces made African-Americans&para;<br>less likely than whites to receive or return juror-eligibility&para;<br>questionnaires, and more likely to assert a hardship ex&para;<br>cuse. Id., at 79a–80a.&para;<br>The hearing convinced the trial court that AfricanAmericans were underrepresented in Circuit Court veni&para;<br>res. App. to Pet. for Cert. 210a. But Smith’s evidence was&para;<br>insufficient, that court held, to prove that the juror&para;<br>assignment order, or any other part of the jury-selection&para;<br>process, had systematically excluded African-Americans.&para;<br>Id., at 210a–212a. The court therefore rejected Smith’s&para;<br>fair-cross-section claim.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that the juror&para;<br>allocation system in place at the relevant time did result&para;<br>in the underrepresentation of African-Americans. Id., at&para;<br>182a–183a. Reversing the trial court’s judgment, the&para;<br>intermediate appellate court ordered a new trial, with&para;<br>jurors selected under the Circuit-Court-first assignment&para;<br>order installed shortly after the voir dire in Smith’s case.&para;<br>Ibid.; see supra, at 5.&para;<br>The Michigan Supreme Court, in turn, reversed the&para;<br>Court of Appeals’ judgment, concluding that Smith “ha[d]&para;<br>not established a prima facie violation of the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment fair-cross-section requirement.” Smith, 463&para;<br>Mich., at 207, 615 N.

The court then noted that&para;<br>lower federal courts had applied three different methods&para;<br>to measure fair and reasonable representation: the abso&para;<br>lute and comparative disparity tests, described supra, at 5,&para;<br>and “the standard deviation test.”1&para;<br>Recognizing that no single test was entirely satisfactory,&para;<br>the Michigan Supreme Court adopted a case-by-case&para;<br>approach allowing consideration of all three means of&para;<br>measuring underrepresentation. Smith, 463 Mich., at&para;<br>204, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. Smith’s statistical evidence, the&para;<br>court found, “failed to establish a legally significant dis&para;<br>parity under either the absolute or comparative disparity&para;<br>tests.” Id., at 204–205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. (The parties&para;<br>had presented no expert testimony regarding application&para;<br>of the standard deviation test. Id., at 204, n. 1, 615 N.

W. 2d, at 2, 3. Smith’s evidence, the&para;<br>court said, did not show “how the alleged siphoning of&para;<br>African American jurors to district courts affected the&para;<br>circuit court jury pool.” Id., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. In&para;<br>particular, the court observed, “[t]he record does not dis&para;<br>close whether the district court jury pools contained more,&para;<br>fewer, or approximately the same percentage of minority&para;<br>jurors as the circuit court jury pool.” Ibid. The court also&para;<br>ruled that “the influence of social and economic factors on&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Standard deviation analysis seeks to determine the probability that&para;<br>the disparity between a group’s jury-eligible population and the group’s&para;<br>percentage in the qualified jury pool is attributable to random chance.&para;<br>See People v.

Under the controlling provision of AEDPA, codified&para;<br>in §2254(d), a state prisoner’s application may not be&para;<br>granted as to “any claim . . . adjudicated . . . in State&para;<br>court” unless the state court’s adjudication&para;<br>“(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or&para;<br>involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab&para;<br>lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme&para;<br>Court of the United States; or&para;<br>“(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un&para;<br>reasonable determination of the facts in light of the&para;<br>evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”&para;<br>Applying these standards, the District Court dismissed&para;<br>Smith’s habeas petition. App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a–42a.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals reversed. Where, as here, the&para;<br>allegedly excluded group is small, the Sixth Circuit ruled,&para;<br>courts should use the comparative disparity test to meas&para;<br>ure underrepresentation. 543 F. 3d, at 338. In that&para;<br>court’s view, Smith’s comparative disparity statistics&para;<br>sufficed “to demonstrate that the representation of African&para;<br>American veniremen in Kent County . . . was unfair and&para;<br>unreasonable.” Ibid. As to systematic exclusion, the Sixth&para;<br>Circuit, in accord with the Michigan intermediate appel&para;<br>late court, believed that the juror-assignment order in&para;<br>effect when Smith’s jury was empaneled significantly&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>reduced the number of African-Americans available for&para;<br>Circuit Court venires. Id., at 342. Smith was entitled to&para;<br>relief, the court concluded, because no important state&para;<br>interest supported that allocation system. Id., at 345.2&para;<br>The State petitioned for certiorari attacking the Sixth&para;<br>Circuit’s decision on two principal grounds: First, the&para;<br>State charged that the federal appellate court erred in&para;<br>adopting the comparative disparity test to determine&para;<br>whether a distinctive group was underrepresented in the&para;<br>jury pool. Pet. for Cert. ii. Second, the State urged that,&para;<br>in any event, “there was no . . . systematic exclusion of&para;<br>African Americans from juries in Kent County, Michigan,”&para;<br>id., at 25, and no warrant for the Sixth Circuit’s contrary&para;<br>determination.3 We granted review, 557 U. S. ____ (2009),&para;<br>and now reverse the Sixth Circuit’s judgment.&para;<br>According to the Sixth Circuit, the Michigan Supreme&para;<br>Court’s rejection of Smith’s Sixth Amendment plea “in&para;<br>volved an unreasonable application o[f] clearly established&para;<br>Federal law, as determined by [this Court in Duren].”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The Sixth Circuit also found that the Michigan Supreme Court had&para;<br>unreasonably applied Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357 (1979), when it&para;<br>declared that social and economic factors could not establish systematic&para;<br>exclusion. 543 F. 3d, at 341–342. Because such factors disproportion&para;<br>ately affect African-Americans, the Sixth Circuit said, Kent County’s&para;<br>routine grants of certain hardship exemptions “produced systematic&para;<br>exclusion within the meaning of Duren.” Ibid. The Sixth Circuit held,&para;<br>however, that the hardship exemptions could not establish a fair-cross&para;<br>section claim because the State “has a significant interest [in] avoiding&para;<br>undue burdens on individuals” by allowing such excuses. Id., at 345.&para;<br>3 Although the question presented by the State homes in on the&para;<br>proper measure for underrepresentation, it initially and more compre&para;<br>hensively inquires whether Smith was denied his right to a jury drawn&para;<br>from a fair cross section of the community. See Pet. for Cert. ii (asking&para;<br>“[w]hether the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit erred in&para;<br>concluding that the Michigan Supreme Court failed to apply ‘clearly&para;<br>established’ Supreme Court precedent under 28 U. S. C. §2254 on the&para;<br>issue of the fair cross-section requirement under Duren . . . .”). We&para;<br>therefore address that overarching issue.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. SMITH&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§2254(d)(1); see 543 F. 3d, at 345. We disagree. As ex&para;<br>plained below, our Duren decision hardly establishes—no&para;<br>less “clearly” so—that Smith was denied his Sixth&para;<br>Amendment right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair&para;<br>cross section of the community.&para;<br>II&para;<br>To establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross&para;<br>section requirement, this Court’s pathmarking decision in&para;<br>Duren instructs, a defendant must prove that: (1) a group&para;<br>qualifying as “distinctive” (2) is not fairly and reasonably&para;<br>represented in jury venires, and (3) “systematic exclusion”&para;<br>in the jury-selection process accounts for the underrepre&para;<br>sentation. 439 U. S., at 364; see supra, at 1–2.&para;<br>The defendant in Duren successfully challenged Jackson&para;<br>County’s administration of a Missouri exemption permit&para;<br>ting any woman to opt out of jury service. 439 U. S., at&para;<br>360. The Court explained why it was plain that defendant&para;<br>Duren had established a prima facie case. First, women in&para;<br>Jackson County were both “numerous and distinct from&para;<br>men.” Id., at 364 (quoting Taylor, 419 U. S., at 531).&para;<br>Second, Duren’s “statistical presentation” showed gross&para;<br>underrepresentation: Women were over half the jury&para;<br>eligible population; in stark contrast, they accounted for&para;<br>less than 15% of jury venires. 439 U. S., at 364–366.&para;<br>Duren also demonstrated systematic exclusion with&para;<br>particularity. He proved that women’s underrepresenta&para;<br>tion was persistent—occurring in every weekly venire for&para;<br>almost a year—and he identified the two stages of the&para;<br>jury-selection process “when . . . the systematic exclusion&para;<br>took place.” Id., at 366. First, questionnaires for prospec&para;<br>tive jurors stated conspicuously that women could opt out&para;<br>of jury service. Less than 30% of those summoned were&para;<br>female, suggesting that women in large numbers claimed&para;<br>the exemption at the questionnaire stage. Ibid. “More&para;<br>over, at the summons stage women were . . . given another&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>opportunity to [opt out].” Id., at 366–367. And if a woman&para;<br>ignored the summons, she was deemed to have opted out;&para;<br>no further inquiry was made. Id., at 367. At this “final,&para;<br>venire, stage,” women’s representation plummeted to&para;<br>14.5%. Ibid. In the Federal District Court serving the&para;<br>same territory, the Court noted, despite a women-only&para;<br>childcare exemption, women accounted for nearly 40% of&para;<br>those actually serving on juries. See ibid., n. 25.&para;<br>The “disproportionate and consistent exclusion of&para;<br>women from the [Jackson County] jury wheel and at the&para;<br>venire stage,” the Court concluded, “was quite obviously&para;<br>due to the system by which juries were selected.” Id., at&para;<br>367. “[A]ppropriately tailored” hardship exemptions, the&para;<br>Court added, would likely survive a fair-cross-section&para;<br>challenge if justified by an important state interest. Id.,&para;<br>at 370. But no such interest, the Court held, could justify&para;<br>Missouri’s exemption for each and every woman—the&para;<br>altogether evident explanation for the underrepresenta&para;<br>tion. Id., at 369–370.&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>As the Michigan Supreme Court correctly observed, see&para;<br>supra, at 6, neither Duren nor any other decision of this&para;<br>Court specifies the method or test courts must use to&para;<br>measure the representation of distinctive groups in jury&para;<br>pools. The courts below and the parties noted three meth&para;<br>ods employed or identified in lower federal court decisions:&para;<br>absolute disparity, comparative disparity, and standard&para;<br>deviation. See Smith, 463 Mich., at 204–205, 615 N. W.&para;<br>2d, at 2–3; Brief for Petitioner 3; Brief for Respondent 26;&para;<br>supra, at 6–7.&para;<br>Each test is imperfect. Absolute disparity and compara&para;<br>tive disparity measurements, courts have recognized, can&para;<br>be misleading when, as here, “members of the distinctive&para;<br>group comp[ose] [only] a small percentage of those eligible&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. SMITH&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>for jury service.” Smith, 463 Mich., at 203–204, 615 N. W.&para;<br>2d, at 2–3. And to our knowledge, “[n]o court . . . has&para;<br>accepted [a standard deviation analysis] alone as determi&para;<br>native in Sixth Amendment challenges to jury selection&para;<br>systems.” United States v. Rioux, 97 F. 3d 648, 655 (CA2&para;<br>1996).&para;<br>On direct review, as earlier stated, the Michigan Su&para;<br>preme Court chose no single method “to measur[e]&para;<br>whether representation was fair and reasonable.” Smith,&para;<br>463 Mich., at 204, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3; see supra, at 7.&para;<br>Instead, it “adopt[ed] a case-by-case approach.” Smith,&para;<br>463 Mich., at 204, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. “Provided that the&para;<br>parties proffer sufficient evidence,” that court said, “the&para;<br>results of all of the tests [should be considered].” Ibid. In&para;<br>contrast, the Sixth Circuit declared that “[w]here the&para;<br>distinctive group alleged to have been underrepresented is&para;<br>small, as is the case here, the comparative disparity test is&para;<br>the more appropriate measure of underrepresentation.”&para;<br>543 F. 3d, at 338.&para;<br>Even in the absence of AEDPA’s constraint, see supra,&para;<br>at 8, we would have no cause to take sides today on the&para;<br>method or methods by which underrepresentation is ap&para;<br>propriately measured.4 Although the Michigan Supreme&para;<br>Court concluded that “[Smith’s] statistical evidence failed&para;<br>to establish a legally significant disparity under either the&para;<br>absolute or comparative disparity tests,” Smith, 463 Mich.,&para;<br>at 204–205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3,5 that court nevertheless&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The State asks us to “adopt the absolute-disparity standard for&para;<br>measuring fair and reasonable representation” and to “requir[e] proof&para;<br>that the absolute disparity exceeds 10%” to make out a prima facie fair&para;<br>cross-section violation. Brief for Petitioner 45–46. Under the rule the&para;<br>State proposes, “the Sixth Amendment offers no remedy for complete&para;<br>exclusion of distinct groups in communities where the population of the&para;<br>distinct group falls below the 10 percent threshold.” Brief for Respon&para;<br>dent 35. We need not reach that issue.&para;<br>5 For similar conclusions, see, for example, United States v.

W. 2d, at 3. It did so in order to&para;<br>reach the issue ultimately dispositive in Duren: To the&para;<br>extent underrepresentation existed, was it due to “system&para;<br>atic exclusion”? Ibid.; see Duren, 439 U. S., at 364.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Addressing the ground on which the Sixth Circuit rested&para;<br>its decision, Smith submits that the district-court-first&para;<br>assignment order systematically excluded AfricanAmericans from Kent County Circuit Court venires. Brief&para;<br>for Respondent 46–48. But as the Michigan Supreme&para;<br>Court not at all unreasonably concluded, Smith, 463&para;<br>Mich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3, Smith’s evidence scarcely&para;<br>shows that the assignment order he targets caused under&para;<br>representation. Although the record established that&para;<br>some officials and others in Kent County believed that the&para;<br>assignment order created racial disparities, and the&para;<br>County reversed the order in response, supra, at 5, the&para;<br>belief was not substantiated by Smith’s evidence.&para;<br>Evidence that African-Americans were underrepre&para;<br>sented on the Circuit Court’s venires in significantly&para;<br>higher percentages than on the Grand Rapids District&para;<br>Court’s could have indicated that the assignment order&para;<br>made a critical difference. But, as the Michigan Supreme&para;<br>Court noted, Smith adduced no evidence to that effect.&para;<br>See Smith, 463 Mich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3. Nor did&para;<br>Smith address whether Grand Rapids, which had the&para;<br>County’s largest African-American population, “ha[d] more&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>3.57%; comparative disparities “rang[ing] from 38.17% to 51.22%”); &para;<br>&para;<br>United States v.

Furthermore,&para;<br>Smith did not endeavor to compare the African-American&para;<br>representation levels in Circuit Court venires with those&para;<br>in the Federal District Court venires for the same region.&para;<br>See id., at 46–47; Duren, 439 U. S., at 367, n. 25.&para;<br>Smith’s best evidence of systematic exclusion was of&para;<br>fered by his statistics expert, who reported a decline in&para;<br>comparative underrepresentation, from 18 to 15.1%, after&para;<br>Kent County reversed the assignment order. See supra, at&para;<br>5. This evidence—particularly in view of AEDPA’s in&para;<br>struction, §2254(d)(2)—is insufficient to support Smith’s&para;<br>claim that the assignment order caused the underrepre&para;<br>sentation. As Smith’s counsel recognized at oral argu&para;<br>ment, this decrease could not fairly be described as “a big&para;<br>change.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 51; see ibid. (the drop was “a&para;<br>step in the right direction”). In short, Smith’s evidence&para;<br>gave the Michigan Supreme Court little reason to conclude&para;<br>that the district-court-first assignment order had a signifi&para;<br>cantly adverse impact on the representation of AfricanAmericans on Circuit Court venires.&para;<br>C&para;<br>To establish systematic exclusion, Smith contends, the&para;<br>defendant must show only that the underrepresentation is&para;<br>persistent and “produced by the method or ‘system’ used to&para;<br>select [jurors],” rather than by chance. Brief for Respon&para;<br>dent 38, 40. In this regard, Smith catalogs a laundry list&para;<br>of factors in addition to the alleged “siphoning” that, he&para;<br>urges, rank as “systematic” causes of underrepresentation&para;<br>of African-Americans in Kent County’s jury pool. Id., at&para;<br>53–54. Smith’s list includes the County’s practice of ex&para;<br>cusing people who merely alleged hardship or simply&para;<br>failed to show up for jury service, its reliance on mail&para;<br>notices, its failure to follow up on nonresponses, its use of&para;<br>residential addresses at least 15 months old, and the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>refusal of Kent County police to enforce court orders for&para;<br>the appearance of prospective jurors. Ibid.&para;<br>No “clearly established” precedent of this Court supports&para;<br>Smith’s claim that he can make out a prima facie case&para;<br>merely by pointing to a host of factors that, individually or&para;<br>in combination, might contribute to a group’s underrepre&para;<br>sentation. Smith recites a sentence in our Duren opinion&para;<br>that, he says, placed the burden of proving causation on&para;<br>the State. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, 35. The sentence reads:&para;<br>“Assuming, arguendo, that the exemptions mentioned by&para;<br>the court below [those for persons over 65, teachers, and&para;<br>government workers] would justify failure to achieve a fair&para;<br>community cross section on jury venires, the State must&para;<br>demonstrate that these exemptions [rather than the&para;<br>women’s exemption] caused the underrepresentation&para;<br>complained of.” 439 U. S., at 368–369. That sentence&para;<br>appears after the Court had already assigned to Duren—&para;<br>and found he had carried—the burden of proving that the&para;<br>underrepresentation “was due to [women’s] systematic&para;<br>exclusion in the jury-selection process.” Id., at 366. The&para;<br>Court’s comment, which Smith clipped from its context,&para;<br>does not concern the demonstration of a prima face case.&para;<br>Instead, it addresses what the State might show to rebut&para;<br>the defendant’s prima facie case. The Michigan Supreme&para;<br>Court was therefore far from “unreasonable,” §2254(d)(1),&para;<br>in concluding that Duren first and foremost required&para;<br>Smith himself to show that the underrepresentation com&para;<br>plained of was “due to systematic exclusion.” Id., at 364;&para;<br>see Smith, 463 Mich., at 205, 615 N. W. 2d, at 3.&para;<br>This Court, furthermore, has never “clearly established”&para;<br>that jury-selection-process features of the kind on Smith’s&para;<br>list can give rise to a fair-cross-section claim.
