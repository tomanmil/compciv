PATTERSON, WARDEN, ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–158.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 24, 2010—Decided June 24, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner Magwood was sentenced to death for murder. After the Ala&para;<br>bama courts denied relief on direct appeal and in postconviction pro&para;<br>ceedings, he sought federal habeas relief. The District Court condi&para;<br>tionally granted the writ as to his sentence, mandating that he be&para;<br>released or resentenced. The state trial court sentenced him to death&para;<br>a second time. He filed another federal habeas application, challeng&para;<br>ing this new sentence on the grounds that he did not have fair warn&para;<br>ing at the time of his offense that his conduct would permit a death&para;<br>sentence under Alabama law, and that his attorney rendered ineffec&para;<br>tive assistance during the resentencing proceeding. The District&para;<br>Court once again conditionally granted the writ. The Eleventh Cir&para;<br>cuit reversed, holding in relevant part that Magwood’s challenge to&para;<br>his new death sentence was an unreviewable “second or successive”&para;<br>challenge under 28 U. S. C. §2244(b) because he could have raised his&para;<br>fair-warning claim in his earlier habeas application.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.&para;<br>555 F. 3d 968, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to&para;<br>Part IV–B, concluding that because Magwood’s habeas application&para;<br>challenges a new judgment for the first time, it is not “second or suc&para;<br>cessive” under §2244(b). Pp. 8–15, 17–22.&para;<br>(a) This case turns on when a claim should be deemed to arise in a&para;<br>“second or successive habeas corpus application.” §§2244(b)(1), (2).&para;<br>The State contends that §2244(b), as amended by the Antiterrorism&para;<br>and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), should be read to&para;<br>bar claims that a prisoner had a prior opportunity to present. Under&para;<br>this “one opportunity” rule, Magwood’s fair-warning claim was “sec&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ond and successive” because he had an opportunity to raise it in his&para;<br>first application but did not. Magwood counters that §2244(b) should&para;<br>not apply to a first application challenging a new judgment interven&para;<br>ing between habeas applications. This Court agrees. The phrase&para;<br>“second or successive” is not defined by AEDPA and it is a “term of&para;<br>art.” Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 486. To determine its mean&para;<br>ing, the Court looks first to the statutory context. Section 2244(b)’s&para;<br>limitations apply only to a “habeas corpus application under §2254,”&para;<br>i.e., an application on “behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the&para;<br>judgment of a State court,” §2254(b)(1). Both §2254(b)’s text and the&para;<br>relief it provides indicate that “second or successive” must be inter&para;<br>preted with respect to the judgment challenged. A §2254 petitioner&para;<br>“seeks invalidation . . . of the judgment authorizing [his] confine&para;<br>ment,” Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 83. If a conditional writ is&para;<br>granted, “the State may seek a new judgment (through a new trial or&para;<br>a new sentencing proceeding).” Ibid. The State errs in contending&para;<br>that, if §2254 is relevant at all, “custody” and not “judgment,” is the&para;<br>proper reference because unlawful “custody” is the “substance” re&para;<br>quirement for habeas relief. This argument is unpersuasive. Section&para;<br>2254 articulates the kind of custody that may be challenged under&para;<br>§2254. Because §2254 applies only to custody pursuant to a state&para;<br>court judgment, that “judgment” is inextricable and essential to re&para;<br>lief. It is a requirement that distinguishes §2254 from other statutes&para;<br>permitting constitutional relief. See, e.g., §§2255, 2241. The State’s&para;<br>“custody”-based rule is also difficult to justify because applying “sec&para;<br>ond or successive” to any subsequent application filed before a pris&para;<br>oner’s release would require a prisoner who remains in continuous&para;<br>custody for an unrelated conviction to satisfy §2244(b)’s strict rules to&para;<br>challenge the unrelated conviction for the first time. Nothing in the&para;<br>statutory text or context supports such an anomalous result. Pp. 8–&para;<br>13.&para;<br>(b) This Court is also not convinced by the State’s argument that a&para;<br>“one opportunity” rule would be consistent with the statute and&para;<br>should be adopted because it better reflects AEDPA’s purpose of pre&para;<br>venting piecemeal litigation and gamesmanship. AEDPA uses “sec&para;<br>ond or successive” to modify “application,” not “claim” as the State&para;<br>contends, and this Court has refused to adopt an interpretation of&para;<br>§2244(b) that would “elid[e] the difference between an ‘application’&para;<br>and a ‘claim,’ ” Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4, 9. The State’s reading&para;<br>also reflects a more fundamental error. It would undermine or ren&para;<br>der superfluous much of §2244(b)(2). In some circumstances, it would&para;<br>increase the restrictions on review by applying pre-AEDPA abuse-of&para;<br>the-writ rules where §2244(b)(2) imposes no restrictions. In others, it&para;<br>would decrease the restrictions on review by applying more lenient&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>pre-AEDPA abuse-of-the-writ rules where §2244(b) mandates stricter&para;<br>requirements. Pp. 13–15.&para;<br>(c) This Court’s interpretation of §2244(b) is consistent with its&para;<br>precedents. Because none of the pre-AEDPA cases that the State in&para;<br>vokes, e.g., Wong Doo v. United States, 265 U. S. 239, applies “second&para;<br>or successive” to an application challenging a new judgment, these&para;<br>cases shed no light on the question presented here. Nor do postAEDPA cases contradict the approach adopted here. Only Burton v.&para;<br>Stewart, 549 U. S. 147, comes close to addressing the threshold ques&para;<br>tion whether an application is “second or successive” if it challenges a&para;<br>new judgment, and that decision confirms that the existence of a new&para;<br>judgment is dispositive. In holding that both of the petitioner’s ha&para;<br>beas petitions had challenged the same judgment, this Court in Bur&para;<br>ton expressly recognized that had there been a new judgment inter&para;<br>vening between the habeas petitions, the result might have been&para;<br>different. Here, there is such an intervening judgment. This is Mag&para;<br>wood’s first application challenging that intervening judgment.&para;<br>Magwood challenges not the trial court’s error in his first sentencing,&para;<br>but the court’s new error when it conducted a full resentencing and&para;<br>reviewed the aggravating evidence afresh. Pp. 15, 17–21.&para;<br>(d) Because Magwood has not attempted to challenge his underly&para;<br>ing conviction, the Court has no occasion to address the State’s objec&para;<br>tion that this reading of §2244(b) allows a petitioner who obtains a&para;<br>conditional writ as to his sentence to file a subsequent application&para;<br>challenging not only his resulting, new sentence, but also his original,&para;<br>undisturbed conviction. Nor does the Court address whether Mag&para;<br>wood’s fair-warning claim is procedurally defaulted or whether the&para;<br>Eleventh Circuit erred in rejecting his ineffective-assistance-of&para;<br>counsel claim.

After the Alabama courts denied&para;<br>relief on direct appeal and in postconviction proceedings,&para;<br>Magwood filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus&para;<br>in Federal District Court, challenging both his conviction&para;<br>and his sentence. The District Court conditionally granted&para;<br>the writ as to the sentence, mandating that Magwood&para;<br>either be released or resentenced. The state trial court&para;<br>conducted a new sentencing hearing and again sentenced&para;<br>Magwood to death. Magwood filed an application for a&para;<br>writ of habeas corpus in federal court challenging this new&para;<br>sentence. The District Court once again conditionally&para;<br>granted the writ, finding constitutional defects in the new&para;<br>sentence. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit&para;<br>reversed, holding in relevant part that Magwood’s chal&para;<br>lenge to his new death sentence was an unreviewable&para;<br>“second or successive” challenge under 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2244(b) because he could have mounted the same chal&para;<br>lenge to his original death sentence. We granted certio&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rari, and now reverse. Because Magwood’s habeas appli&para;<br>cation1 challenges a new judgment for the first time, it is&para;<br>not “second or successive” under §2244(b).&para;<br>I&para;<br>After a conviction for a drug offense, Magwood served&para;<br>several years in the Coffee County Jail in Elba, Alabama,&para;<br>under the watch of Sheriff C. F. “Neil” Grantham. During&para;<br>his incarceration, Magwood, who had a long history of&para;<br>mental illness, became convinced that Grantham had&para;<br>imprisoned him without cause, and vowed to get even&para;<br>upon his release. Magwood followed through on his&para;<br>threat. On the morning of March 1, 1979, shortly after his&para;<br>release, he parked outside the jail and awaited the sher&para;<br>iff’s arrival. When Grantham exited his car, Magwood&para;<br>shot him and fled the scene.&para;<br>Magwood was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of&para;<br>an on-duty sheriff, a capital offense under Alabama Code&para;<br>§13–11–2(a)(5) (1975).2 He was tried in 1981. The prose&para;<br>cution asked the jury to find Magwood guilty of aggra&para;<br>vated murder as charged in the indictment, and sought&para;<br>the death penalty. Magwood pleaded not guilty by reason&para;<br>of insanity; however, the jury found him guilty of capital&para;<br>murder under §13–11–2(a)(5), and imposed the sentence of&para;<br>death based on the aggravation charged in the indictment.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Although 28 U. S. C. §2244(b) refers to a habeas “application,” we&para;<br>use the word “petition” interchangeably with the word “application,” as&para;<br>we have in our prior cases.&para;<br>2 At the time of the murder, Alabama Code §13–11–2(a) provided: “If&para;<br>the jury finds the defendant guilty, it shall fix the punishment at death&para;<br>when the defendant is charged by indictment with any of the following&para;<br>offenses and with aggravation, which must also be averred in the&para;<br>indictment . . . .” The offenses included “murder of any . . . sheriff . . .&para;<br>while . . . on duty or because of some official or job-related act.” §13–&para;<br>11–2(a)(5). The same statute set forth a list of “aggravating circum&para;<br>stances,” §13–11–6, but the trial court found that none existed in&para;<br>Magwood’s case.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>In accordance with Alabama law, the trial court reviewed&para;<br>the basis for the jury’s decision. See §§13–11–3, 13–11–4.&para;<br>Although the court did not find the existence of any statu&para;<br>tory “aggravating circumstance” under §13–11–6, the&para;<br>court relied on Ex parte Kyzer, 399 So. 2d 330 (Ala. 1981),&para;<br>to find that murder of a sheriff while “on duty or because&para;<br>of some official or job-related acts,” §13–11–2(a)(5), is a&para;<br>capital felony that, by definition, involves aggravation&para;<br>sufficient for a death sentence.3 The trial court found that&para;<br>Magwood’s young age (27 at the time of the offense) and&para;<br>lack of significant criminal history qualified as mitigating&para;<br>factors, but found no mitigation related to Magwood’s&para;<br>mental state. Weighing the aggravation against the two&para;<br>mitigating factors, the court approved the sentence of&para;<br>death. The Alabama courts affirmed. See Magwood v.&para;<br>State, 426 So. 2d 918, 929 (Ala. Crim. App. 1982); Ex parte&para;<br>Magwood, 426 So. 2d 929, 932 (Ala. 1983). We denied&para;<br>certiorari. Magwood v. Alabama, 462 U.

In Kyzer, the defen&para;<br>dant had been sentenced to death for the intentional murder of “two or&para;<br>more human beings” under §13–11–2(a)(10). See 399 So. 2d, at 332.&para;<br>The crime of murder, so defined, was aggravated by its serial nature,&para;<br>just as Magwood’s crime of murder, as defined under §13–11–2(a)(5),&para;<br>was aggravated by the fact that he killed an on-duty sheriff because of&para;<br>the sheriff’s job-related acts. In Kyzer, the Alabama Supreme Court&para;<br>ultimately remanded for a new trial, but in order to guide the lower&para;<br>court on remand, addressed whether the aggravation in the charged&para;<br>crime, see §13–11–2(a)(10), was sufficient to impose a sentence of death&para;<br>even without a finding of any “aggravating circumstance” enumerated&para;<br>in §13–11–6. See id., at 337. The court ruled that if the defendant was&para;<br>convicted under §13–11–2(a)(10), “the jury and the trial judge at the&para;<br>sentencing hearing [may] find the aggravation averred in the indict&para;<br>ment as the aggravating circumstance, even though the aggravation is&para;<br>not listed in §13–11–6 as an aggravating circumstance.” Id., at 339&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>July 22, 1983, Magwood filed a coram nobis petition and&para;<br>an application for a stay of execution. The trial court held&para;<br>a hearing on the petition and denied relief on July 18,&para;<br>1983.4&para;<br>Eight days before his scheduled execution, Magwood&para;<br>filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus under 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2254, and the District Court granted a stay of&para;<br>execution. After briefing by the parties, the District Court&para;<br>upheld Magwood’s conviction but vacated his sentence and&para;<br>conditionally granted the writ based on the trial court’s&para;<br>failure to find statutory mitigating circumstances relating&para;<br>to Magwood’s mental state.5 See Magwood v. Smith, 608&para;<br>F. Supp. 218, 225–226, 229 (MD Ala. 1985). The Court of&para;<br>Appeals affirmed. See Magwood v. Smith, 791 F. 2d 1438,&para;<br>1450 (CA11 1986).&para;<br>In response to the conditional writ, the state trial court&para;<br>held a new sentencing proceeding in September 1986.&para;<br>This time, the judge found that Magwood’s mental state,&para;<br>as well as his age and lack of criminal history, qualified as&para;<br>statutory mitigating circumstances. As before, the court&para;<br>found that Magwood’s capital felony under §13–11–2(a)(5)&para;<br>included sufficient aggravation to render him death eligi&para;<br>ble. In his proposed findings, Magwood’s attorney agreed&para;<br>that Magwood’s offense rendered him death eligible, but&para;<br>argued that a death sentence would be inappropriate in&para;<br>light of the mitigating factors.

The trial court denied relief. It held that the statu&para;<br>tory basis for Magwood’s death sentence had been&para;<br>affirmed on direct appeal and could not be relitigated. The&para;<br>trial court also held that Magwood’s attorney played no&para;<br>substantive role in the resentencing and had no obligation&para;<br>to dispute the aggravation, given that the District Court&para;<br>had required only that the trial court consider additional&para;<br>mitigating factors.&para;<br>Magwood appealed the denial of his Rule 20 petition,&para;<br>arguing, inter alia, that his sentence was unconstitutional&para;<br>because he did not have fair warning that his offense could&para;<br>be punished by death, and that he received constitution&para;<br>ally ineffective assistance of counsel at resentencing.

See §2244(b)(3)(A)&para;<br>(requiring authorization from the Court of Appeals to file a&para;<br>second or successive application). The Court of Appeals&para;<br>denied his request. See In re Magwood, 113 F. 3d 1544&para;<br>(CA11 1997). He simultaneously filed a petition for a writ&para;<br>of habeas corpus challenging his new death sentence,&para;<br>which the District Court conditionally granted. See Mag&para;<br>wood v. Culliver, 481 F. Supp. 2d 1262, 1295 (MD Ala.&para;<br>2007). In that petition, Magwood again argued that his&para;<br>sentence was unconstitutional because he did not have fair&para;<br>warning at the time of his offense that his conduct would&para;<br>be sufficient to warrant a death sentence under Alabama&para;<br>law, and that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance&para;<br>during the resentencing proceeding.&para;<br>Before addressing the merits of Magwood’s fair-warning&para;<br>claim, the District Court sua sponte considered whether&para;<br>the application was barred as a “successive petition” under&para;<br>§2244, and concluded that it was not.

See 481 F. Supp. 2d, at 1285–1286; supra,&para;<br>at 5. Addressing the merits, the District Court ruled that&para;<br>Magwood’s death sentence was unconstitutional because&para;<br>“at the time of the offense conduct, Magwood did not have&para;<br>fair notice that he could be sentenced to death absent at&para;<br>least one aggravating circumstance enumerated in former&para;<br>1975 Ala. Code §13–11–6.” 481 F. Supp. 2d, at 1285. The&para;<br>District Court also found the state court’s grounds for&para;<br>rejecting Magwood’s ineffective-assistance claim unrea&para;<br>sonable in light of clearly established federal law, noting&para;<br>that Magwood’s attorney in fact had engaged substan&para;<br>tively in the “complete and new” resentencing, and al&para;<br>though the attorney could not be expected to object on&para;<br>state-law grounds foreclosed by precedent, he was clearly&para;<br>ineffective for failing to raise the federal fair-warning&para;<br>claim. Id., at 1294 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals reversed in relevant part. See 555&para;<br>F. 3d 968 (CA11 2009). It concluded that the first step in&para;<br>determining whether §2244(b) applies is to “separate the&para;<br>new claims challenging the resentencing from the old&para;<br>claims that were or should have been presented in the&para;<br>prior application.” Id., at 975 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).

We agree.&para;<br>We begin with the text. Although Congress did not&para;<br>define the phrase “second or successive,” as used to modify&para;<br>“habeas corpus application under section 2254,”&para;<br>§§2244(b)(1)–(2), it is well settled that the phrase does not&para;<br>simply “refe[r] to all §2254 applications filed second or&para;<br>successively in time,” Panetti v.

The limitations im&para;<br>posed by §2244(b) apply only to a “habeas corpus applica&para;<br>tion under §2254,” that is, an “application for a writ of&para;<br>habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to&para;<br>the judgment of a State court,” §2254(b)(1) (emphasis&para;<br>added). The reference to a state-court judgment in&para;<br>§2254(b) is significant because the term “application”&para;<br>cannot be defined in a vacuum. A §2254 petitioner is&para;<br>applying for something: His petition “seeks invalidation&para;<br>(in whole or in part) of the judgment authorizing the pris&para;<br>oner’s confinement,” Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U. S. 74, 83&para;<br>(2005) (emphasis added). If his petition results in a dis&para;<br>trict court’s granting of the writ, “the State may seek a&para;<br>new judgment (through a new trial or a new sentencing&para;<br>proceeding).” Ibid. (emphasis in original). Thus, both&para;<br>§2254(b)’s text and the relief it provides indicate that the&para;<br>phrase “second or successive” must be interpreted with&para;<br>respect to the judgment challenged.&para;<br>The State disagrees, contending that if the cross&para;<br>reference to §2254 is relevant, we should focus not on the&para;<br>statute’s reference to a “judgment” but on its reference to&para;<br>“custody,” Brief for Respondents 53; compare §§2254(a),&para;<br>(b) (establishing rules for review of “an application for a&para;<br>writ of habeas corpus” on “behalf of a person in custody&para;<br>pursuant to the judgment of a State court” (emphasis&para;<br>added)) with §2254(a) (specifying that an application may&para;<br>be entertained “only on the ground that [the petitioner] is&para;<br>in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or trea&para;<br>ties of the United States” (emphasis added)). The State&para;<br>explains that unlawful “custody” is the key “ ‘substance&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>AEDPA.” 529 U. S., at 473, 486. Courts have followed Slack in post-&para;<br>&para;<br>AEDPA cases, and the State agrees it is relevant to the question&para;<br>&para;<br>presented here.

Section 2254&para;<br>articulates the kind of confinement that may be chal&para;<br>lenged on the ground that the petitioner is being held “in&para;<br>violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the&para;<br>United States.” §2254(a). The requirement of custody&para;<br>pursuant to a state-court judgment distinguishes §2254&para;<br>from other statutory provisions authorizing relief from&para;<br>constitutional violations—such as §2255, which allows&para;<br>challenges to the judgments of federal courts, or 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §1983, which allows federal-court suits against&para;<br>state and local officials. Custody is crucial for §2254&para;<br>purposes, but it is inextricable from the judgment that&para;<br>authorizes it.&para;<br>The State’s “custody”-based rule is difficult to justify for&para;<br>another reason. Under the State’s approach, applying the&para;<br>phrase “second or successive” to any subsequent applica&para;<br>tion filed before a prisoner’s release would mean that a&para;<br>prisoner who remains in continuous custody for a com&para;<br>pletely unrelated conviction would have to satisfy the&para;<br>strict rules for review under §2244(b) to challenge his&para;<br>unrelated conviction for the first time. Nothing in the&para;<br>statutory text or context supports, much less requires,&para;<br>such an anomalous result. See, e.g., Beyer, 306 F. 3d, at&para;<br>507 (“[A] prisoner is entitled to one free-standing collateral&para;<br>attack per judgment, rather than one attack per stretch of&para;<br>imprisonment”); cf.

According to the State, a&para;<br>“one opportunity” rule is consistent with the statutory&para;<br>text, and better reflects AEDPA’s purpose of preventing&para;<br>piecemeal litigation and gamesmanship.&para;<br>We are not persuaded. AEDPA uses the phrase “second&para;<br>or successive” to modify “application.” See §§2244(b)(1),&para;<br>(2). The State reads the phrase to modify “claims.” See,&para;<br>e.g., Brief for Respondents 51 (“Congress’ intent for&para;<br>AEDPA was to eradicate successive claims”). We cannot&para;<br>replace the actual text with speculation as to Congress’&para;<br>intent. We have previously found Congress’ use of the&para;<br>word “application” significant, and have refused to adopt&para;<br>an interpretation of §2244(b) that would “elid[e] the differ&para;<br>ence between an ‘application’ and a ‘claim,’ ” Artuz, 531&para;<br>U. S., at 9; see also Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S. 524, 530&para;<br>(2005) (“[F]or purposes of §2244(b), an ‘application’ for&para;<br>habeas relief is a filing that contains one or more&para;<br>‘claims’ ”). Therefore, although we agree with the State&para;<br>that many of the rules under §2244(b) focus on claims,&para;<br>that does not entitle us to rewrite the statute to make the&para;<br>phrase “second or successive” modify claims as well.10&para;<br>The State’s reading leads to a second, more fundamental&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Our focus on the judgment accords with current filing requirements.&para;<br>See Habeas Corpus Rule 2(b) (requiring any petitioner to “ask for relief&para;<br>from the state-court judgment being contested”); Rule 2(e) (prescribing&para;<br>that any “petitioner who seeks relief from judgments of more than one&para;<br>state court must file a separate petition covering the judgment or&para;<br>judgments of each court”).&para;<br>10 The dissent recognizes that the phrase “second or successive” ap&para;<br>plies to an application as a whole, see post, at 2–4 (opinion of KENNEDY,&para;<br>J.), but departs in other significant ways from the statutory text, see&para;<br>infra, at 14–15.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>error. Under the State’s “one opportunity” rule, the&para;<br>phrase “second or successive” would apply to any claim&para;<br>that the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to raise&para;<br>in a prior application. And the phrase “second or succes&para;<br>sive” would not apply to a claim that the petitioner did not&para;<br>have a full and fair opportunity to raise previously.&para;<br>This reading of §2244(b) would considerably under&para;<br>mine—if not render superfluous—the exceptions to dis&para;<br>missal set forth in §2244(b)(2). That section describes&para;<br>circumstances when a claim not presented earlier may be&para;<br>considered: intervening and retroactive case law, or newly&para;<br>discovered facts suggesting “that . . . no reasonable fact&para;<br>finder would have found the applicant guilty of the under&para;<br>lying offense.” §2244(b)(2)(B)(ii). In either circumstance,&para;<br>a petitioner cannot be said to have had a prior opportunity&para;<br>to raise the claim, so under the State’s rule the claim&para;<br>would not be successive and §2244(b)(2) would not apply to&para;<br>it at all. This would be true even if the claim were raised&para;<br>in a second application challenging the same judgment.11&para;<br>In addition to duplicating the exceptions under §2244(b)&para;<br>in some circumstances, the State’s rule would dilute them&para;<br>in others. Whereas the exception to dismissal of fact&para;<br>based claims not presented in a prior application applies&para;<br>only if the facts provide clear and convincing evidence&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 This case does not require us to determine whether §2244(b) ap&para;<br>plies to every application filed by a prisoner in custody pursuant to a&para;<br>state-court judgment if the prisoner challenged the same state-court&para;<br>judgment once before. Three times we have held otherwise. See Slack&para;<br>v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 475, 487 (2000); Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal,&para;<br>523 U. S. 637, 643 (1998); Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.

The&para;<br>question in this case is whether a first application challenging a new&para;<br>sentence in an intervening judgment is second or successive. It is not&para;<br>whether an application challenging the same state-court judgment&para;<br>must always be second or successive.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

We decline to adopt a reading that&para;<br>would thus truncate §2244(b)(2)’s requirements.&para;<br>IV &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>We are not persuaded by the State or the dissent that&para;<br>the approach we take here contradicts our precedents.&para;<br>The State invokes several pre-AEDPA cases denying&para;<br>review of claims in second or successive applications&para;<br>where the petitioners did not avail themselves of prior&para;<br>opportunities to present the claims. See Wong Doo v.&para;<br>United States, 265 U. S. 239 (1924); Antone v. Dugger, 465&para;<br>U. S. 200 (1984) (per curiam); Woodard v. Hutchins, 464&para;<br>U. S. 377 (1984) (per curiam); Delo v. Stokes, 495 U. S. 320&para;<br>(1990) (per curiam); McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467&para;<br>(1991). These cases, the State contends, show that Mag&para;<br>wood’s fair-warning claim should be dismissed as second&para;<br>or successive because he could have raised—but did not&para;<br>raise—the claim in his first application.&para;<br>But none of these pre-AEDPA decisions applies the&para;<br>phrase “second or successive” to an application challenging&para;<br>a new judgment. Therefore, the decisions cast no light on&para;<br>the question before the Court today: whether abuse-of-the&para;<br>writ rules, as modified by AEDPA under §2244(b)(2), apply&para;<br>at all to an application challenging a new judgment. The&para;<br>State’s misplaced reliance on those cases stems from its&para;<br>failure to distinguish between §2244(b)’s threshold inquiry&para;<br>into whether an application is “second or successive,” and&para;<br>its subsequent inquiry into whether claims in a successive&para;<br>application must be dismissed.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>MAGWOOD v.

AEDPA modifies&para;<br>those abuse-of-the-writ principles and creates new statu&para;<br>tory rules under §2244(b). These rules apply only to “sec&para;<br>ond or successive” applications. The dissent contends that&para;<br>this reading renders AEDPA inapplicable to a broad range&para;<br>of abusive claims that would have been barred under prior&para;<br>rules. Yet, the dissent fails to cite any case in which this&para;<br>Court has dismissed a claim as successive or abusive if the&para;<br>petitioner raised it in an application challenging a new&para;<br>judgment.&para;<br>The dissent’s conclusion that our reading of §2254 “un&para;<br>moor[s] the phrase ‘second or successive’ from its textual&para;<br>and historical underpinnings,” post, at 8, is unwarranted.&para;<br>Pre-AEDPA usage of the phrase “second or successive” is&para;<br>consistent with our reading. A review of our habeas&para;<br>precedents shows that pre-AEDPA cases cannot affirma&para;<br>tively define the phrase “second or successive” as it ap&para;<br>pears in AEDPA. Congress did not even apply the phrase&para;<br>“second or successive” to applications filed by state prison&para;<br>ers until it enacted AEDPA. The phrase originally arose&para;<br>in the federal context, see §2255 (1946 ed., Supp. II), and&para;<br>applied only to applications raising previously adjudicated&para;<br>claims, see Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1, 12&para;<br>(1963). After this Court interpreted the law to permit&para;<br>dismissal of “abusive” claims—as distinguished from&para;<br>“successive” claims, see ibid.—Congress codified restric&para;<br>tions on both types of claims in §2244(b), but still without&para;<br>using the phrase “second or successive.” See §2244(b)&para;<br>(1964 ed., Supp. IV) (providing rules governing applica&para;<br>tions filed by state as well as federal prisoners). It was not&para;<br>until 1996 that AEDPA incorporated the phrase “second or&para;<br>successive” into §2244(b).

And that case confirms that the&para;<br>existence of a new judgment is dispositive. In Burton, the&para;<br>petitioner had been convicted and sentenced in state court&para;<br>in 1994. See id., at 149. He successfully moved for resen&para;<br>tencing based on vacatur of an unrelated prior conviction.&para;<br>Id., at 150.

In December 1998, with&para;<br>state review of his new sentence still pending, the peti&para;<br>tioner filed a §2254 application challenging his 1994 con&para;<br>viction. The District Court denied it on the merits, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals affirmed, and we denied certiorari.

Although petitioner had styled his first&para;<br>petition as a challenge to the 1994 conviction and his&para;<br>second petition as a challenge to the 1998 sentence, we&para;<br>concluded that both attacked the same “judgment” be&para;<br>cause the 1998 sentence was already in place when the&para;<br>petitioner filed his first application for federal habeas&para;<br>relief. See id., at 156. In other words, the judgment he&para;<br>challenged in his 1998 application was “the same one&para;<br>challenged in the subsequent 2002 petition”; it “was the&para;<br>judgment pursuant to which [the petitioner] was being&para;<br>detained.” Ibid. (emphasis added). We expressly recog&para;<br>nized that the case might have been different had there&para;<br>been a “new judgment intervening between the two ha&para;<br>beas petitions.” Ibid. There was no such judgment in&para;<br>Burton, but there is such an intervening judgment here.&para;<br>This is Magwood’s first application challenging that&para;<br>intervening judgment. The errors he alleges are new. It is&para;<br>obvious to us—and the State does not dispute—that his&para;<br>claim of ineffective assistance at resentencing turns upon&para;<br>new errors. But, according to the State, his fair-warning&para;<br>claim does not, because the state court made the same&para;<br>mistake before. We disagree. An error made a second&para;<br>time is still a new error.

Under the opportunity&para;<br>based rule advanced by the State and the dissent, the&para;<br>answer must be yes. All 10 claims would have to be dis&para;<br>missed.

PATTERSON&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>Absent two exceptions that are inapplicable here, the&para;<br>relevant statutory provision in AEDPA provides:&para;<br>“A claim presented in a second or successive habeas&para;<br>corpus application under section 2254 that was not&para;<br>presented in a prior application shall be dismissed&para;<br>. . . .” 28 U. S. C. §2244(b)(2).&para;<br>The question before the Court is whether petitioner Billy&para;<br>Joe Magwood filed “a second or successive” application by&para;<br>raising a claim in his second habeas petition that he had&para;<br>available and yet failed to raise in his first petition.&para;<br>The term “second or successive” is a habeas “term of&para;<br>art.” Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 486 (2000). It&para;<br>incorporates the pre-AEDPA abuse-of-the-writ doctrine.&para;<br>Panetti, 551 U. S., at 947. Before today, that legal princi&para;<br>ple was established by the decisions of this Court. See,&para;<br>e.g., ibid.; Slack, 529 U. S., at 486. Under that rule, to&para;<br>determine whether an application is “second or succes&para;<br>sive,” a court must look to the substance of the claim the&para;<br>application raises and decide whether the petitioner had a&para;<br>full and fair opportunity to raise the claim in the prior&para;<br>application. Panetti, 551 U. S., at 947. Applying this&para;<br>analytical framework puts applications into one of three&para;<br>categories.&para;<br>First, if the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to&para;<br>raise the claim in the prior application, a second-in-time&para;<br>application that seeks to raise the same claim is barred as&para;<br>“second or successive.” This is consistent with pre-AEDPA&para;<br>cases applying the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine and the bar&para;<br>on “second or successive” applications. See, e.g., Wong Doo&para;<br>v. United States, 265 U.

Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 489 (1991), explained, “a&para;<br>petitioner can abuse the writ by raising a claim in a sub&para;<br>sequent petition that he could have raised in his first,&para;<br>regardless of whether the failure to raise it earlier&para;<br>stemmed from a deliberate choice.” See also Habeas Cor&para;<br>pus Rule 2(c) (instructing habeas petitioners to “specify all&para;<br>the grounds for relief available to [them]” and to “state the&para;<br>facts supporting each ground”); Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S.&para;<br>298, 317–323 (1995) (describing adoption in habeas,&para;<br>through legislation and judicial decision, of modified res&para;<br>judicata (claim preclusion) doctrine); 18 C.

Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure&para;<br>§4406, p. 138 (2d ed. 2002) (claim preclusion aspect of res&para;<br>judicata doctrine bars “matters that [were not, but] ought&para;<br>to have been raised” in prior litigation).&para;<br>Second, if the petitioner had no fair opportunity to raise&para;<br>the claim in the prior application, a subsequent applica&para;<br>tion raising that claim is not “second or successive,” and&para;<br>§2244(b)(2)’s bar does not apply. This can occur where the&para;<br>claim was not yet ripe at the time of the first petition, see,&para;<br>e.g., Panetti, supra, at 947, or where the alleged violation&para;<br>occurred only after the denial of the first petition, such as&para;<br>the State’s failure to grant the prisoner parole as required&para;<br>by state law, see, e.g., Hill v. Alaska, 297 F. 3d 895, 898–&para;<br>899 (CA9 2002); Crouch v.

PATTERSON&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>unaddressed claim is not abusive by any definition. If the&para;<br>Court believes there are “[m]any examples” where abuse&para;<br>of-the-writ principles unfairly close the door to state pris&para;<br>oners seeking federal habeas review, ibid., one would&para;<br>think the Court would be able to come up with an exam&para;<br>ple. It does not do so.&para;<br>Third, a “mixed petition”—raising both abusive and&para;<br>nonabusive claims—would be “second or successive.” In&para;<br>that circumstance the petitioner would have to obtain&para;<br>authorization from the court of appeals to proceed with the&para;<br>nonabusive claims. See §2244(b)(3); see also 28 J. Moore&para;<br>et al., Federal Practice §671.10[2][b] (3d ed. 2010). After&para;<br>the court of appeals makes its determination, a district&para;<br>court may consider nonabusive claims that the petitioner&para;<br>had no fair opportunity to present in his first petition and&para;<br>dismiss the abusive claims. See §2244(b)(4).&para;<br>The operation of the above rule is exemplified by the&para;<br>Court’s decision in Panetti. Panetti’s claim that he was&para;<br>mentally incompetent to be executed under Ford v. Wain&para;<br>wright, 477 U. S. 399 (1986), did not become ripe until&para;<br>after the denial of his first habeas petition. When the&para;<br>Ford claim became ripe, Panetti filed a second habeas&para;<br>petition, raising his Ford claim for the first time. In con&para;<br>cluding that this second habeas petition was not a “second&para;<br>or successive” application, this Court explained that “sec&para;<br>ond or successive” did not “refe[r] to all §2254 applications&para;<br>filed second or successively in time,” but was rather a&para;<br>term-of-art that “takes its full meaning from our case law,&para;<br>including decisions predating the enactment of [AEDPA].”&para;<br>551 U. S., at 943–944. The Court relied on AEDPA’s&para;<br>purpose of “ ‘further[ing] the principles of comity, finality,&para;<br>and federalism,’ ” id., at 945 (quoting Miller-El v. Cockrell,&para;<br>537 U. S. 322, 337 (2003)), an aversion to the “empty&para;<br>formality requiring prisoners to file unripe” claims, 551&para;<br>U. S., at 946, and this Court’s pre-AEDPA cases regarding&para;<br>the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine, id., at 947. Panetti thus&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>looked to the nature of the claim raised in the second-in&para;<br>time habeas petition to determine that the application was&para;<br>not “second or successive.” Ibid.&para;<br>The above principles apply to a situation, like the pre&para;<br>sent one, where the petitioner in his first habeas proceed&para;<br>ing succeeds in obtaining a conditional grant of relief,&para;<br>which allows the state court to correct an error that oc&para;<br>curred at the original sentencing. Assume, as alleged&para;<br>here, that in correcting the error in a new sentencing&para;<br>proceeding, the state court duplicates a different mistake&para;<br>that also occurred at the first sentencing. The second&para;<br>application is “second or successive” with respect to that&para;<br>claim because the alleged error “could and should have”&para;<br>been raised in the first petition. Woodard, 464 U. S., at&para;<br>379 (opinion of Powell, J.). Put another way, under abuse&para;<br>of-the-writ principles, a petitioner loses his right to chal&para;<br>lenge the error by not raising a claim at the first opportu&para;<br>nity after his claim becomes ripe. On the other hand, if&para;<br>the petitioner raises a claim in his second habeas petition&para;<br>that could not have been raised in the earlier petition—&para;<br>perhaps because the error occurred for the first time dur&para;<br>ing resentencing—then the application raising the claim is&para;<br>not “second or successive” and §2244(b)(2)’s bar does not&para;<br>apply.&para;<br>Although the above-cited authorities are adequate to&para;<br>show that the application in this case is “second or succes&para;<br>sive,” it must be noted that no previous case from this&para;<br>Court has dealt with the precise sequence of events here:&para;<br>A petitioner attempts to bring a previously unraised claim&para;<br>after a second resentencing proceeding that followed a&para;<br>grant of federal habeas relief. The conclusion that such an&para;<br>application is barred as “second or successive” unless the&para;<br>claim was previously unavailable is consistent with the&para;<br>approach of every court of appeals that has considered the&para;<br>issue, although some of those cases highlight subtleties&para;<br>that are not relevant under abuse-of-the-writ principles.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>See, e.g., Pratt v. United States, 129 F. 3d 54, 62–63 (CA1&para;<br>1997); Galtieri v. United States, 128 F. 3d 33, 37–38 (CA2&para;<br>1997); United States v. Orozco-Ramirez, 211 F. 3d 862, 871&para;<br>(CA5 2000); Lang v. United States, 474 F. 3d 348, 351−353&para;<br>(CA6 2007). While most of these cases arose in the context&para;<br>of federal prisoners’ challenges to their convictions or&para;<br>sentences under 28 U. S. C. §2255, the “second or succes&para;<br>sive” bar under §2244(b) applies to §2255 motions. See&para;<br>§2255(h) (2006 ed., Supp. II).&para;<br>In the present case the Court should conclude that&para;<br>Magwood has filed a “second or successive habeas corpus&para;<br>application.” In 1983, he filed a first federal habeas peti&para;<br>tion raising nine claims, including that the trial court&para;<br>improperly failed to consider two mitigating factors when&para;<br>it imposed Magwood’s death sentence. The District Court&para;<br>granted Magwood’s petition and ordered relief only on the&para;<br>mitigating factor claim. The state trial court then held a&para;<br>new sentencing proceeding, in which it considered all of&para;<br>the mitigating factors and reimposed the death penalty.&para;<br>In 1997, Magwood brought a second habeas petition, this&para;<br>time raising an argument that could have been, but was&para;<br>not, raised in his first petition. The argument was that he&para;<br>was not eligible for the death penalty because he did not&para;<br>have fair notice that his crime rendered him death eligi&para;<br>ble. There is no reason that Magwood could not have&para;<br>raised the identical argument in his first habeas petition.&para;<br>Because Magwood had a full and fair opportunity to adju&para;<br>dicate his death-eligibility claim in his first petition in&para;<br>1983, his 1997 petition raising this claim is barred as&para;<br>“second or successive.”&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Court reaches the opposite result by creating an ill&para;<br>defined exception to the “second or successive” application&para;<br>bar. The Court, in my respectful view, makes two critical&para;<br>errors. First, it errs in rejecting Panetti’s claim-based&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>approach to determining whether an application is “second&para;<br>or successive.” Second, it imposes an atextual exception to&para;<br>§2244(b)’s bar against “second or successive” applications,&para;<br>requiring that the second-in-time application be brought&para;<br>against the same judgment. This second error is under&para;<br>scored by the fact that the Court refuses to deal with the&para;<br>logical implications of its newly created rule.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Court concludes that because AEDPA refers to&para;<br>“second or successive” applications rather than “second or&para;<br>successive” claims, the nature of the claims raised in the&para;<br>second application is irrelevant. See ante, at 13 (“[A]l&para;<br>though we agree with the State that many of the rules&para;<br>under §2244(b) focus on claims, that does not entitle us to&para;<br>rewrite the statute to make the phrase ‘second or succes&para;<br>sive’ modify claims as well”). This is incorrect. As ex&para;<br>plained above, Panetti establishes that deciding whether&para;<br>an application itself is “second or successive” requires&para;<br>looking to the nature of the claim that the application&para;<br>raises to determine whether the petitioner had a full and&para;<br>fair opportunity to raise that claim in his earlier petition.&para;<br>Indeed, the only way Panetti could have concluded that&para;<br>the application there was not “second or successive” was to&para;<br>look at the underlying claim the application raised. 551&para;<br>U. S., at 947.&para;<br>While the Court asserts it is not calling Panetti into&para;<br>doubt, see ante, at 14, n. 11, it does not even attempt to&para;<br>explain how its analysis is consistent with that opinion, cf.&para;<br>Panetti, 551 U. S., at 964 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (“Before&para;<br>AEDPA’s enactment, the phrase ‘second or successive’&para;<br>meant the same thing it does today—any subsequent&para;<br>federal habeas application challenging a state-court judg&para;<br>ment”). The best that can be said is the Court is limiting&para;<br>its new doctrine so it has no applicability to previously&para;<br>unexhausted Ford claims, confining the holding of Panetti&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>to the facts of that case. 551 U. S., at 968 (THOMAS, J.,&para;<br>dissenting) (“Today’s decision thus stands only for the&para;<br>proposition that Ford claims somehow deserve a special&para;<br>(and unjustified) exemption from the statute’s plain&para;<br>import”).&para;<br>Failing to consider the nature of the claim when decid&para;<br>ing whether an application is barred as “second or succes&para;<br>sive” raises other difficulties. Consider a second-in-time&para;<br>habeas petition challenging an alleged violation that&para;<br>occurred entirely after the denial of the first petition; for&para;<br>example, a failure to grant a prisoner parole at the time&para;<br>promised him by state law or the unlawful withdrawal of&para;<br>good-time credits. See supra, at 3. Under the Court’s&para;<br>rule, it would appear that a habeas application challeng&para;<br>ing those alleged violations would be barred as “second or&para;<br>successive” because it would be a second-in-time applica&para;<br>tion challenging custody pursuant to the same judgment.&para;<br>That result would be inconsistent with abuse-of-the-writ&para;<br>principles and might work a suspension of the writ of&para;<br>habeas corpus.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Having unmoored the phrase “second or successive”&para;<br>from its textual and historical underpinnings, the Court&para;<br>creates a new puzzle for itself: If the nature of the claim is&para;<br>not what makes an application “second or successive,”&para;<br>then to what should a court look? Finding no reference&para;<br>point in §2244(b)’s text, the Court searches in AEDPA for&para;<br>a different peg.&para;<br>The Court believes that it finds its peg in a different&para;<br>provision:&para;<br>“[A] district court shall entertain an application for a&para;<br>writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody&para;<br>pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the&para;<br>ground that he is in custody in violation of the Consti&para;<br>tution or laws or treaties of the United States.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>§2254(a).&para;<br>But this provision does not purport to create any prerequi&para;<br>sites to §2244(b)’s bar against “second or successive” appli&para;<br>cations. The accepted reading of the quoted language is&para;<br>that this is a mere “status requirement.” See 1 R. Hertz &amp;&para;<br>J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Proce&para;<br>dure §8.1, p. 391 (5th ed. 2005). The provision stands for&para;<br>the simple proposition that a petitioner must be held&para;<br>“pursuant to the judgment of a State court” to be able to&para;<br>file any §2254(b) petition in the first place. That reading&para;<br>also explains why federal habeas petitions can attack not&para;<br>only the judgment pursuant to which the petitioner is&para;<br>being held but also “the duration of sentence . . . and . . .&para;<br>the conditions under which that sentence is being served,”&para;<br>including rules such as “the basis of parole” and “good&para;<br>time” credits. Id., §9.1, at 475–481.&para;<br>The Court’s reading of the phrase “pursuant to the&para;<br>judgment of a State court” as a limitation on §2244(b)(2)’s&para;<br>“second or successive” application bar is artificial. The&para;<br>Court would amend §2244(b)(2) to read: “A claim pre&para;<br>sented in a second or successive habeas corpus application&para;<br>under section 2254 that was not presented in a prior&para;<br>application [against the same judgment] shall be dis&para;<br>missed.” This is not what §2244(b)(2) says.&para;<br>The Court wholly glosses over another significant prob&para;<br>lem with its atextual analysis. The Court relies upon the&para;<br>notion that “[a]n error made a second time is still a new&para;<br>error.” Ante, at 18. But in making this statement, the&para;<br>Court can mean one of two very different things:&para;<br>First, it could mean that any error logically encom&para;<br>passed in a reentered judgment is a “new” error. A crimi&para;<br>nal “judgment” generally includes both the conviction and&para;<br>the sentence. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(k)(1) (a&para;<br>criminal judgment “must set forth the plea, the jury ver&para;<br>dict or the court’s findings, the adjudication, and the&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sentence”); Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 314, n. 2 (1989)&para;<br>(“As we have often stated, a criminal judgment necessarily&para;<br>includes the sentence imposed upon the defendant”). This&para;<br>well-established principle applies in the federal habeas&para;<br>context, where petitioner is “in custody pursuant to the&para;<br>judgment.” §2254(b). A person cannot be held in custody&para;<br>“pursuant to” a sentence, but only pursuant to “the” (e.g.,&para;<br>one) judgment, which includes both the conviction and&para;<br>sentence. See Burton v. Stewart, 549 U. S. 147, 156–157&para;<br>(2007) (per curiam) (explaining that AEDPA’s statute of&para;<br>limitations did not run until the judgment—“both his&para;<br>conviction and sentence became final” (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted)).&para;<br>Under this principle, the Court’s holding today would&para;<br>allow a challenger in Magwood’s position to raise any&para;<br>challenge to the guilt phase of the criminal judgment&para;<br>against him in his second application, since a “new” judg&para;<br>ment—consisting of both the conviction and sentence—has&para;<br>now been reentered and all of the errors have (apparently)&para;<br>occurred anew. As an illustration, the state trial court&para;<br>here reentered the following judgment after resentencing:&para;<br>“IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED BY&para;<br>THE COURT that Billy Joe Magwood is guilty of the&para;<br>offense of aggravated murder . . . and that Billy Joe Mag&para;<br>wood is sentenced to death.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 106a.&para;<br>This would mean that Magwood’s attorney could dig&para;<br>through anything that occurred from voir dire to the cross&para;<br>examination of witnesses to the jury’s guilty verdict, and&para;<br>raise any alleged errors for the first time in his second&para;<br>habeas application, all because the trial court did not&para;<br>properly consider two mitigating factors during Magwood’s&para;<br>first sentencing proceeding.&para;<br>Second, and alternatively, the Court could retreat even&para;<br>further from the statutory text and conclude that only&para;<br>some parts of the reentered judgment are open to chal&para;<br>lenge by way of a second habeas application. Magwood,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>for example, argues that he can only challenge previously&para;<br>unraised errors made during sentencing. Brief for Peti&para;<br>tioner 21, n. 8. Indeed, Magwood goes further and sug&para;<br>gests that even the sentencing would not be reopened in a&para;<br>case where a court’s order leads the trial court to revise&para;<br>only the defendant’s term of supervised release. Id., at 28,&para;<br>n. 11. If the Court is adopting this some-parts-of-the&para;<br>criminal-judgment exception to the “second or successive”&para;<br>application bar, it is unclear why the error that Magwood&para;<br>now raises is a “new error” at all. After all, Magwood did&para;<br>not challenge his death eligibility in his first habeas peti&para;<br>tion but only disputed that he should not get the death&para;<br>penalty, as a matter of discretion, if the trial court prop&para;<br>erly weighed all of the aggravating and mitigating factors.&para;<br>The state trial court conducted this reweighing and had no&para;<br>reason to reconsider the uncontested finding that Mag&para;<br>wood is death eligible. It is hard to see how the trial&para;<br>court’s failure to reconsider sua sponte its previous death&para;<br>eligibility finding is a “new error,” any more than its fail&para;<br>ure to reconsider the various errors that may have taken&para;<br>place at the guilt phase would have been new errors.&para;<br>The Court contends the approach dictated by Panetti&para;<br>“considerably undermine[s]—if not render[s] superfluous,”&para;<br>ante, at 14, the exceptions in §2244(b)(2), which allow a&para;<br>petitioner to bring a claim in a “second or successive”&para;<br>application based on certain factual discoveries or based&para;<br>on a new Supreme Court precedent that has been applied&para;<br>retroactively. The Court seems to be saying that applying&para;<br>Panetti’s rule would make the exceptions superfluous,&para;<br>because any claim that would satisfy the exceptions would&para;<br>necessarily satisfy the more general rule derived from the&para;<br>abuse-of-the-writ doctrine. But the Court misconceives&para;<br>the scope of the rule that an application is only “second or&para;<br>successive” if it raises for the first time a claim that could&para;<br>have been raised before. A second petition raising a claim&para;<br>that could have been raised in a prior petition, even&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>though strengthened by a new decision from this Court or&para;<br>based upon newly discovered evidence, is still “second or&para;<br>successive.” Thus this subsequent application would only&para;<br>be permitted if it qualified under the pertinent subsection&para;<br>(b)(2) exception. In fact, it is the Court’s approach that&para;<br>limits the relevance of the subsection (b)(2) exceptions.&para;<br>Under the Court’s theory, the “second or successive” bar&para;<br>does not apply at all to applications filed by petitioners in&para;<br>Magwood’s situation, and thus the subsection (b)(2) excep&para;<br>tions would have no operation in that context.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Court’s approach disregards AEDPA’s “ ‘principles&para;<br>of comity, finality, and federalism.’ ” Panetti, 551 U. S., at&para;<br>945 (quoting Miller-El, 537 U. S., at 337). Under the&para;<br>Court’s newly created exception to the “second or succes&para;<br>sive” application bar, a defendant who succeeds on even&para;<br>the most minor and discrete issue relating to his sentenc&para;<br>ing would be able to raise 25 or 50 new sentencing claims&para;<br>in his second habeas petition, all based on arguments he&para;<br>failed to raise in his first petition. “[I]f reexamination of&para;<br>[a] convictio[n] in the first round of habeas offends federal&para;<br>ism and comity, the offense increases when a State must&para;<br>defend its conviction in a second or subsequent habeas&para;<br>proceeding on grounds not even raised in the first peti&para;<br>tion.” McCleskey, 499 U. S., at 492.&para;<br>The Court’s novel exception would also allow the once&para;<br>successful petitioner to reraise every argument against a&para;<br>sentence that was rejected by the federal courts during the&para;<br>first round of federal habeas review. As respondents&para;<br>explain, under the Court’s theory, “a post-resentencing&para;<br>petitioner could simply staple a new cover page with the&para;<br>words, ‘§2254 Petition Attacking New Judgment,’ to his&para;<br>previously adjudicated petition.” Brief for Respondents&para;<br>47. Because traditional res judicata principles do not&para;<br>apply to federal habeas proceedings, see Salinger v. Loisel,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>265 U. S. 224, 230 (1924), this would force federal courts&para;<br>to address twice (or thrice, or more) the same claims of&para;<br>error. The State and the victims would have to bear anew&para;<br>the “ significant costs of federal habeas corpus review,”&para;<br>McCleskey, supra, at 490–491, all because the petitioner&para;<br>previously succeeded on a wholly different, discrete, and&para;<br>possibly unrelated claim.&para;<br>The Court’s suggestion that “[i]t will not take a court&para;<br>long to dispose of such claims where the court has already&para;<br>analyzed the legal issues,” ante, at 20, n. 15, misses the&para;<br>point. This reassurance will be cold comfort to overworked&para;<br>state district attorneys, who will now have to waste time&para;<br>and resources writing briefs analyzing dozens of claims&para;<br>that should be barred by abuse-of-the-writ principles. It is&para;<br>difficult to motivate even the most dedicated professionals&para;<br>to do their best work, day after day, when they have to&para;<br>deal with the dispiriting task of responding to previously&para;<br>rejected or otherwise abusive claims. But that is exactly&para;<br>what the Court is mandating, under a statute that was&para;<br>designed to require just the opposite result. If the analy&para;<br>sis in this dissent is sound it is to be hoped that the States&para;<br>will document the ill effects of the Court’s opinion so that&para;<br>its costs and deficiencies are better understood if this&para;<br>issue, or a related one, can again come before the Court.&para;<br>The Court’s new exception will apply not only to death&para;<br>penalty cases like the present one, where the newly raised&para;<br>claim appears arguably meritorious. It will apply to all&para;<br>federal habeas petitions following a prior successful peti&para;<br>tion, most of which will not be in death cases and where&para;<br>the abusive claims the Court now permits will wholly lack&para;<br>merit. And, in this vein, it is striking that the Court’s&para;<br>decision means that States subject to federal habeas re&para;<br>view henceforth receive less recognition of a finality inter&para;<br>est than the Federal Government does on direct review of&para;<br>federal criminal convictions. See United States v. Parker,&para;<br>101 F. 3d 527, 528 (CA7 1996) (Posner, C. J.) (“A party&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>MAGWOOD v. PATTERSON&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>cannot use the accident of a remand to raise in a second&para;<br>appeal an issue that he could just as well have raised in&para;<br>the first appeal because the remand did not affect it”).&para;<br>The Court’s approach also turns AEDPA’s bar against&para;<br>“second or successive” applications into a one-way ratchet&para;<br>that favors habeas petitioners. Unless today’s decision is&para;<br>read to unduly limit Panetti, see supra, at 7–8, AEDPA&para;<br>still incorporates recognized exceptions to the abuse-of&para;<br>the-writ doctrine to allow petitioners to bring their previ&para;<br>ously unavailable and unripe claims, see ante, at 1&para;<br>(BREYER, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg&para;<br>ment). But after today’s holding, AEDPA now “modi&para;<br>fie[s],” ante, at 15, abuse-of-the-writ principles and allows&para;<br>petitioners to bring abusive claims so long as they have&para;<br>won any victory pursuant to a prior federal habeas peti&para;<br>tion. The Court thus reads AEDPA as creating a new&para;<br>loophole that habeas petitioners can exploit to challenge&para;<br>their sentences based on grounds they previously ne&para;<br>glected to raise. This is inconsistent with the understand&para;<br>ing that AEDPA adds “new restrictions on successive&para;<br>petitions” and “further restricts the availability of relief to&para;<br>habeas petitioners.” Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 664&para;<br>(1996).&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Had Magwood been unsuccessful in his first petition, all&para;<br>agree that claims then available, but not raised, would be&para;<br>barred. But because he prevailed in his attack on one part&para;<br>of his sentencing proceeding the first time around, the&para;<br>Court rules that he is free, postsentencing, to pursue&para;<br>claims on federal habeas review that might have been&para;<br>raised earlier. The Court is mistaken in concluding that&para;<br>Congress, in enacting a statute aimed at placing new&para;<br>restrictions on successive petitions, would have intended&para;<br>this irrational result.&para;<br>Magwood had every chance to raise his death-eligibility&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.
