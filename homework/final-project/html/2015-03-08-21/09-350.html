However, under California&para;<br>law, their names were added to a Child Abuse Central Index (Index),&para;<br>where they would remain available to various state agencies for at&para;<br>least 10 years. The statute has no procedures for allowing individu&para;<br>als to challenge their inclusion in the Index, and neither California&para;<br>nor Los Angeles County has created such procedures. Respondents&para;<br>filed suit under §1983, seeking damages, an injunction, and a decla&para;<br>ration that public officials and petitioner Los Angeles County had de&para;<br>prived them of their constitutional rights by failing to create a&para;<br>mechanism through which they could contest inclusion in the Index.&para;<br>The District Court granted the defendants summary judgment, but&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit disagreed, holding that the Fourteenth Amendment&para;<br>required the State to provide those on the list with notice and a hear&para;<br>ing, and thus respondents were entitled to declaratory relief. The&para;<br>court also held that respondents were prevailing parties entitled to&para;<br>attorney’s fees, including $60,000 from the county. The county ob&para;<br>jected, claiming that as a municipal entity, it was liable only if its&para;<br>“policy or custom” caused the deprivation of a plaintiff’s federal right,&para;<br>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694;&para;<br>but a state policy caused any deprivation here. The Ninth Circuit, in&para;<br>ter alia, found that respondents did prevail against the county on&para;<br>their claim for declaratory relief because Monell did not apply to pro&para;<br>spective relief claims.&para;<br>Held: Monell’s “policy or custom” requirement applies in §1983 cases&para;<br>irrespective of whether the relief sought is monetary or prospective.&para;<br>Pp. 4–10.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(a) In Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, this Court based its holding&para;<br>that municipal entities were not “person[s]” under §1983 on the pro&para;<br>vision’s legislative history, particularly Congress’ rejection of the so&para;<br>called Sherman amendment, which would have made municipalities&para;<br>liable for damages done by private persons “ ‘riotously and tumultu&para;<br>ously assembled,’ ” id., at 188–190, and n. 38. Reexamining this leg&para;<br>islative history in Monell, the Court overruled Monroe. It concluded&para;<br>that Congress had rejected the Sherman amendment, not because it&para;<br>would have imposed liability on municipalities, but because it would&para;<br>have imposed such liability solely based on the acts of others. The&para;<br>Court, on the basis of the statutory text and the legislative history,&para;<br>went on to explain what acts are the municipality’s own for purposes&para;<br>of liability. The Court held that “a municipality cannot be held li&para;<br>able” solely for the acts of others, e.g., “solely because it employs a&para;<br>tortfeasor,” 436 U. S., at 691, but it may be held liable “when execu&para;<br>tion of a government’s policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury,” id., at&para;<br>694. Pp. 4–7.&para;<br>(b) Section 1983, read in light of Monell’s understanding of the leg&para;<br>islative history, explains why claims for prospective relief, like claims&para;<br>for money damages, fall within the scope of the “policy or custom” re&para;<br>quirement. Nothing in §1983 suggests that the causation require&para;<br>ment should change with the form of relief sought. In fact, the text&para;<br>suggests the opposite when it provides that a person who meets&para;<br>§1983’s elements “shall be liable . . . in an action at law, suit in eq&para;<br>uity, or other proper proceeding for redress.” Thus, as Monell explic&para;<br>itly stated, “local governing bodies . . . can be sued directly under&para;<br>§1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here,&para;<br>the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or exe&para;<br>cutes” a policy or custom. 436 U. S., at 690. To find the “policy or&para;<br>custom” requirement inapplicable in prospective relief cases would&para;<br>also undermine Monell’s logic. For whether an action or omission is a&para;<br>municipality’s “own” has to do with the nature of the action or omis&para;<br>sion, not with the nature of the relief that is later sought in court.&para;<br>Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(c) Respondents’ arguments to the contrary are unconvincing.&para;<br>Pp. 8–9.&para;<br>&para;<br>Reversed and remanded.&para;<br>BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other&para;<br>Members joined, except KAGAN, J., who took no part in the considera&para;<br>tion or decision of the case.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

CRAIG ARTHUR HUMPHRIES ET AL.&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[November 30, 2010] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>In Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436&para;<br>U. S. 658 (1978), this Court held that civil rights plaintiffs&para;<br>suing a municipal entity under 42 U. S. C. §1983 must&para;<br>show that their injury was caused by a municipal policy or&para;<br>custom. The case before the Court in Monell directly&para;<br>involved monetary damages. The question presented is&para;<br>whether the “policy or custom” requirement also applies&para;<br>when plaintiffs seek prospective relief, such as an injunc&para;<br>tion or a declaratory judgment. We conclude that it does&para;<br>so apply.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The case arises out of the following circumstances: The&para;<br>California Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act, Cal.&para;<br>Penal Code Ann. §11164 et seq. (West Rev. Supp. 2010),&para;<br>requires law enforcement and other state agencies to&para;<br>investigate allegations of child abuse. These agencies&para;<br>must report to the California Department of Justice all&para;<br>instances of reported child abuse the agency finds “not&para;<br>unfounded,” even if they are “inconclusive or unsubstanti&para;<br>ated.” §§11169(a), 11170(a)(3). The statute requires the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>department to include all these reports in a Child Abuse&para;<br>Central Index (Index), where they remain available to&para;<br>various state agencies for at least 10 years. §11170(a).&para;<br>The statute also says that if&para;<br>“a report has previously been filed which subse&para;<br>quently proves to be unfounded, the Department of&para;<br>Justice shall be notified in writing of that fact and&para;<br>shall not retain the report.” §11169(a).&para;<br>The statute, however, does not set forth procedures for&para;<br>reviewing whether a previously filed report is unfounded,&para;<br>or for allowing individuals to challenge their inclusion in&para;<br>the Index. Nor, up until the time of this lawsuit, had&para;<br>California or Los Angeles County created any such proce&para;<br>dures. But cf. §11170(a)(2) (“The submitting agencies are&para;<br>responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and retention&para;<br>of the reports described in this section”).&para;<br>The two plaintiffs in this case were initially accused of&para;<br>child abuse. But they were later exonerated. They sought&para;<br>to have their names removed from the Index. Unable to&para;<br>convince the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department to remove&para;<br>them, they filed this §1983 case against the attorney&para;<br>general of California, the Los Angeles County sheriff, two&para;<br>detectives in the sheriff’s department, and the County of&para;<br>Los Angeles. They sought damages, an injunction, and a&para;<br>declaration that the defendants had deprived them of their&para;<br>constitutional rights by failing to create a procedural&para;<br>mechanism through which one could contest inclusion on&para;<br>the Index. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14; Rev. Stat. §1979,&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §1983. The District Court for the Central&para;<br>District of California granted summary judgment to all of&para;<br>the defendants on the ground that California had not&para;<br>deprived plaintiffs of a constitutionally protected “liberty”&para;<br>interest. But on appeal the Ninth Circuit disagreed.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit held that the Fourteenth Amendment&para;<br>required the State to provide those included on the list&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>notice and “ ‘some kind of hearing.’ ” 554 F. 3d 1170, 1201&para;<br>(2009). Thus the Circuit held that the plaintiffs were&para;<br>entitled to declaratory relief, and it believed that (on&para;<br>remand) they might prove damages as well. Ibid.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit also held that the plaintiffs were&para;<br>prevailing parties, thereby entitled to approximately&para;<br>$600,000 in attorney’s fees. 42 U. S. C. §1988(b) (provid&para;<br>ing for payment of attorney’s fees to parties prevailing on&para;<br>§1983 claims). See No. 05–56467 (June 22, 2009), App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 1–4 (hereinafter First Fee Order); No. 05–&para;<br>56467 (Dec. 2, 2009), App. to Reply to Brief in Opposition&para;<br>1–2 (hereinafter Second Fee Order). The Ninth Circuit&para;<br>wrote that Los Angeles County must pay approximately&para;<br>$60,000 of this amount. First Fee Order 3; Second Fee&para;<br>Order 2.&para;<br>Los Angeles County denied that it was liable and there&para;<br>fore that it could be held responsible for attorney’s fees. It&para;<br>argued that, in respect to the county, the plaintiffs were&para;<br>not prevailing parties. That is because the county is a&para;<br>municipal entity. Under Monell’s holding a municipal&para;<br>entity is liable under §1983 only if a municipal “policy or&para;<br>custom” caused a plaintiff to be deprived of a federal right.&para;<br>436 U. S., at 694 (emphasis added). And it was state&para;<br>policy, not county policy, that brought about any depriva&para;<br>tion here.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit responded to this argument as fol&para;<br>lows: First, it said that county policy might be responsible&para;<br>for the deprivation. It “is possible,” the Ninth Circuit said,&para;<br>that the county, “[b]y failing to” “creat[e] an independent&para;<br>procedure that would allow” the plaintiffs “to challenge&para;<br>their listing[,] . . . adopted a custom and policy that vio&para;<br>lated” the plaintiffs’ “constitutional rights.” 554 F. 3d, at&para;<br>1202. Second, it said that “because this issue is not clear&para;<br>based on the record before us on appeal . . . we remand to&para;<br>the district court to determine the County’s liability under&para;<br>Monell.” Ibid. Third, it saw no reason to remand in re&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>spect to the county’s obligation to pay $60,000 in attor&para;<br>ney’s fees. That, it wrote, is because “in our circuit . . . the&para;<br>limitations to liability established in Monell do not apply&para;<br>to claims for prospective relief,” such as the declaratory&para;<br>judgment that the Circuit had ordered entered. First Fee&para;<br>Order 3–4 (citing Chaloux v. Killeen, 886 F. 2d 247, 250&para;<br>(CA9 1989); Truth v. Kent School Dist., 542 F. 3d 634, 644&para;<br>(CA9 2008); emphasis added).&para;<br>The county then asked us to review this last-mentioned&para;<br>Ninth Circuit holding, namely, the holding that Monell’s&para;<br>“policy or custom” requirement applies only to claims for&para;<br>damages but not to claims for prospective relief. Because&para;<br>the Courts of Appeals are divided on this question, we&para;<br>granted the county’s petition for certiorari. Compare&para;<br>Reynolds v. Giuliani, 506 F. 3d 183, 191 (CA2 2007) (hold&para;<br>ing that Monell’s “policy or custom” requirement applies to&para;<br>claims for prospective relief as well as claims for dam&para;<br>ages); Dirrane v. Brookline Police Dept., 315 F. 3d 65, 71&para;<br>(CA1 2002) (same); Greensboro Professional Fire Fighters&para;<br>Assn., Local 3157 v. Greensboro, 64 F. 3d 962, 967, n. 6&para;<br>(CA4 1995) (applying the Monell requirement to a prospec&para;<br>tive relief claim); Church v. Huntsville, 30 F. 3d 1332,&para;<br>1347 (CA11 1994) (same), with Chaloux, supra, at 251&para;<br>(holding that Monell does not apply to prospective relief&para;<br>claims). See also Gernetzke v. Kenosha Unified School&para;<br>Dist. No. 1, 274 F. 3d 464, 468 (CA7 2001) (reserving the&para;<br>question but noting the “predominant” view that “Monell’s&para;<br>holding applies regardless of the nature of the relief&para;<br>sought”).&para;<br>We conclude that Monell’s holding applies to §1983&para;<br>claims against municipalities for prospective relief as well&para;<br>as to claims for damages.&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>We begin with §1983 itself, which provides: &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“Every person who, under color of any [state] stat&para;<br>ute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage . . . sub&para;<br>jects, or causes to be subjected, any . . . other per&para;<br>son . . . to the deprivation of any rights . . . secured by&para;<br>the Constitution and laws [of the United States], shall&para;<br>be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit&para;<br>in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.”&para;<br>(Emphasis added.)&para;<br>In 1961, in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, this Court held&para;<br>that municipal entities were not “person[s]” under §1983.&para;<br>The Court based this conclusion on the history of the Civil&para;<br>Rights Act of 1871’s enactment. It noted that Congress&para;<br>rejected an amendment (called the Sherman amendment)&para;<br>that would have made municipalities liable for damage&para;<br>done by private persons “ ‘riotously and tumultuously&para;<br>assembled.’ ” Id., at 188–190, and n. 38 (quoting Cong.&para;<br>Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 663 (1871)). This rejection,&para;<br>the Court thought, reflected a determination by the 1871&para;<br>House of Representatives that “ ‘Congress had no constitu&para;<br>tional power to impose any obligation upon county and&para;<br>town organizations, the mere instrumentality for the&para;<br>administration of state law.’ ” 365 U. S., at 190 (quoting&para;<br>Cong. Globe, supra, at 804 (statement of Rep. Poland);&para;<br>emphasis added). The Court concluded that Congress&para;<br>must have doubted its “constitutional power . . . to impose&para;<br>civil liability on municipalities.” 365 U. S., at 190. And&para;<br>for that reason, Congress must have intended to exclude&para;<br>municipal corporations as §1983 defendants. The statute’s&para;<br>key term “person” therefore did not cover municipal enti&para;<br>ties. Id., at 191.&para;<br>Sixteen years later, in Monell, the Court reconsidered&para;<br>the question of municipal liability. After reexamining the&para;<br>1871 legislative history in detail, the Court concluded that&para;<br>Congress had rejected the Sherman amendment, not&para;<br>because it would have imposed liability upon municipali&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ties, but because it would have imposed liability upon&para;<br>municipalities based purely upon the acts of others. That&para;<br>is to say, the rejected amendment would have imposed&para;<br>liability upon local governments “without regard to&para;<br>whether a local government was in any way at fault for&para;<br>the breach of the peace for which it was to be held for&para;<br>damages.” 436 U. S., at 681, n. 40 (emphasis added). In&para;<br>Monell’s view Congress may have thought that it lacked&para;<br>the power to impose that kind of indirect liability upon&para;<br>municipalities, id., at 679, but “nothing said in debate on&para;<br>the Sherman amendment would have prevented holding a&para;<br>municipality liable . . . for its own violations of the Four&para;<br>teenth Amendment,” id., at 683 (emphasis added). The&para;<br>Court, overruling Monroe, held that municipalities were&para;<br>“persons” under §1983. 436 U. S., at 690.&para;<br>The Court also concluded that a municipality could not&para;<br>be held liable under §1983 solely because it employed a&para;<br>tortfeasor. The Court’s conclusion rested on “the language&para;<br>of §1983, read against the background of the same legisla&para;<br>tive history.” Id., at 691. Section 1983’s causation lan&para;<br>guage imposes liability on a “ ‘person who . . . shall subject,&para;<br>or cause to be subjected, any person’ ” to a deprivation of&para;<br>federal rights. Ibid. (quoting 17 Stat. 13; emphasis de&para;<br>leted). That language, the Court observed, could not “be&para;<br>easily read to impose liability vicariously . . . solely on the&para;<br>basis of the existence of an employer-employee relation&para;<br>ship with a tortfeasor.” 436 U. S., at 692. The statute’s&para;<br>legislative history, in particular the constitutional objec&para;<br>tions that had been raised to the Sherman amendment,&para;<br>supported this conclusion. Id., at 692–94, and n. 57.&para;<br>For these reasons, the Court concluded that a munici&para;<br>pality could be held liable under §1983 only for its own&para;<br>violations of federal law. Id., at 694. The Court described&para;<br>what made a violation a municipality’s own violation:&para;<br>“Local governing bodies, therefore, can be sued di&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rectly under §1983 for monetary, declaratory, or in&para;<br>junctive relief where, as here, the action that is al&para;<br>leged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a&para;<br>policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision of&para;<br>ficially adopted and promulgated by that body’s offi&para;<br>cers. . . . [They can also be sued for] deprivations vis&para;<br>ited pursuant to governmental ‘custom’ even though&para;<br>such a custom has not received formal approval&para;<br>through the body’s official decisionmaking channels.”&para;<br>Id., at 690–691 (footnote omitted).&para;<br>The Court has also included the terms “usage” and “prac&para;<br>tice” as customs for which liability is appropriate. See&para;<br>ibid. The length of this list of types of municipal action&para;<br>leads us here to use a shorthand term “policy or custom,”&para;<br>but when we do so, we mean to refer to the entire list. See&para;<br>id., at 694 (using the shorthand “policy or custom”); see&para;<br>also, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Comm., 555&para;<br>U. S. 246, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10) (using the phrase&para;<br>“custom, policy, or practice,” to describe municipal liability&para;<br>under §1983).&para;<br>In sum, in Monell the Court held that “a municipality&para;<br>cannot be held liable” solely for the acts of others, e.g.,&para;<br>“solely because it employs a tortfeasor.” 436 U. S., at 691.&para;<br>But the municipality may be held liable “when execution&para;<br>of a government’s policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury.”&para;<br>Id., at 694 (emphasis added).&para;<br>B&para;<br>The language of §1983 read in light of Monell’s under&para;<br>standing of the legislative history explains why claims for&para;<br>prospective relief, like claims for money damages, fall&para;<br>within the scope of the “policy or custom” requirement.&para;<br>Nothing in the text of §1983 suggests that the causation&para;<br>requirement contained in the statute should change with&para;<br>the form of relief sought. In fact, the text suggests the&para;<br>opposite when it provides that a person who meets §1983’s&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>elements “shall be liable . . . in an action at law, suit in&para;<br>equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.” Thus, as&para;<br>Monell explicitly stated, “[l]ocal governing bodies . . . can&para;<br>be sued directly under §1983 for monetary, declaratory, or&para;<br>injunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged&para;<br>to be unconstitutional implements or executes” a policy or&para;<br>custom. 436 U. S., at 690 (emphasis added). Monell went&para;<br>on to quote this Court’s statement in a 1973 case, Kenosha&para;<br>v. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507, 513, to the effect that the Con&para;<br>gress that enacted §1983 did not intend the “ ‘generic word&para;<br>“person” . . . to have a bifurcated application to municipal&para;<br>corporations depending on the nature of the relief sought&para;<br>against them.’ ” 436 U. S., at 701, n. 66 (emphasis added).&para;<br>Monell added that “[n]othing we say today affects” this&para;<br>pre-Monell “conclusion.” Ibid.&para;<br>Monell’s logic also argues against any such relief-based&para;<br>bifurcation. The Monell Court thought that Congress&para;<br>intended potential §1983 liability where a municipality’s&para;<br>own violations were at issue but not where only the viola&para;<br>tions of others were at issue. The “policy or custom” re&para;<br>quirement rests upon that distinction and embodies it in&para;<br>law. To find the requirement inapplicable where prospec&para;<br>tive relief is at issue would undermine Monell’s logic. For&para;<br>whether an action or omission is a municipality’s “own”&para;<br>has to do with the nature of the action or omission, not&para;<br>with the nature of the relief that is later sought in court.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The Humphries’ (hereinafter respondents) arguments to&para;<br>the contrary are unconvincing. Respondents correctly note&para;<br>that by the time Monell reached the Supreme Court only&para;<br>the plaintiffs’ damages claim remained live. See id., at&para;<br>661. From this fact they conclude that the Court’s holding&para;<br>applies directly only to claims for monetary damages. A&para;<br>holding, however, can extend through its logic beyond the&para;<br>specific facts of the particular case. It does so here.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondents add that not only did Monell involve a&para;<br>damages claim, but its holding rests upon the concern that&para;<br>municipalities might have to pay large damages awards.&para;<br>The Court so suggests when it points out that municipali&para;<br>ties should not be liable for an employee’s wrongful acts,&para;<br>simply by applying agency-based principles of respondeat&para;<br>superior. But as we have pointed out, the Court’s rejection&para;<br>of respondeat superior liability primarily rested not on the&para;<br>municipality’s economic needs, but on the fact that liabil&para;<br>ity in such a case does not arise out of the municipality’s&para;<br>own wrongful conduct.&para;<br>Respondents further claim that, where prospective relief&para;<br>is at issue, Monell is redundant. They say that a court&para;<br>cannot grant prospective relief against a municipality&para;<br>unless the municipality’s own conduct has caused the&para;<br>violation. Hence, where such relief is otherwise proper,&para;<br>the Monell requirement “shouldn’t screen out any case.”&para;<br>Tr. of Oral Arg. 48.&para;<br>To argue that a requirement is necessarily satisfied,&para;<br>however, is not to argue that its satisfaction is unneces&para;<br>sary. If respondents are right, our holding may have&para;<br>limited practical significance. But that possibility does not&para;<br>provide us with a convincing reason to sow confusion by&para;<br>adopting a bifurcated relief-based approach to municipal&para;<br>liability that the Court has previously rejected.&para;<br>Finally, respondents make the mirror-image argument&para;<br>that applying Monell’s requirement to prospective relief&para;<br>claims will leave some set of ongoing constitutional viola&para;<br>tions beyond redress. Despite the fact that four Circuits&para;<br>apply Monell’s requirement to prospective relief, however,&para;<br>respondents have not presented us with any actual or&para;<br>hypothetical example that provides serious cause for&para;<br>concern.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>For these reasons, we hold that Monell’s “policy or cus&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>LOS ANGELES COUNTY v. HUMPHRIES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tom” requirement applies in §1983 cases irrespective of&para;<br>whether the relief sought is monetary or prospective.
