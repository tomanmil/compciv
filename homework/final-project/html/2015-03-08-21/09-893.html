CONCEPCION ET UX.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–893.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued November 9, 2010—Decided April 27, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>The cellular telephone contract between respondents (Concepcions) and&para;<br>petitioner (AT&amp;T) provided for arbitration of all disputes, but did not&para;<br>permit classwide arbitration. After the Concepcions were charged&para;<br>sales tax on the retail value of phones provided free under their ser&para;<br>vice contract, they sued AT&amp;T in a California Federal District Court.&para;<br>Their suit was consolidated with a class action alleging, inter alia,&para;<br>that AT&amp;T had engaged in false advertising and fraud by charging&para;<br>sales tax on “free” phones. The District Court denied AT&amp;T’s motion&para;<br>to compel arbitration under the Concepcions’ contract. Relying on&para;<br>the California Supreme Court’s Discover Bank decision, it found the&para;<br>arbitration provision unconscionable because it disallowed classwide&para;<br>proceedings. The Ninth Circuit agreed that the provision was uncon&para;<br>scionable under California law and held that the Federal Arbitration&para;<br>Act (FAA), which makes arbitration agreements “valid, irrevocable,&para;<br>and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity&para;<br>for the revocation of any contract,” 9 U. S. C. §2, did not preempt its&para;<br>ruling.&para;<br>Held: Because it “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and exe&para;<br>cution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,” Hines v.&para;<br>Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67, California’s Discover Bank rule is pre&para;<br>empted by the FAA. Pp. 4–18.&para;<br>(a) Section 2 reflects a “liberal federal policy favoring arbitration,”&para;<br>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S.&para;<br>1, 24, and the “fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of&para;<br>contract,” Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U. S. ____, ____.&para;<br>Thus, courts must place arbitration agreements on an equal footing&para;<br>with other contracts, Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546&para;<br>U.

Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Jun&para;<br>ior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 478. Section 2’s saving clause permits&para;<br>agreements to be invalidated by “generally applicable contract de&para;<br>fenses,” but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or derive&para;<br>their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at is&para;<br>sue. Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687. Pp. 4–&para;<br>5.&para;<br>(b) In Discover Bank, the California Supreme Court held that class&para;<br>waivers in consumer arbitration agreements are unconscionable if&para;<br>the agreement is in an adhesion contract, disputes between the par&para;<br>ties are likely to involve small amounts of damages, and the party&para;<br>with inferior bargaining power alleges a deliberate scheme to de&para;<br>fraud. Pp. 5–6.&para;<br>(c) The Concepcions claim that the Discover Bank rule is a ground&para;<br>that “exist[s] at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract”&para;<br>under FAA §2. When state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a&para;<br>particular type of claim, the FAA displaces the conflicting rule. But&para;<br>the inquiry is more complex when a generally applicable doctrine is&para;<br>alleged to have been applied in a fashion that disfavors or interferes&para;<br>with arbitration. Although §2’s saving clause preserves generally&para;<br>applicable contract defenses, it does not suggest an intent to preserve&para;<br>state-law rules that stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of&para;<br>the FAA’s objectives. Cf. Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529&para;<br>U. S. 861, 872. The FAA’s overarching purpose is to ensure the en&para;<br>forcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms so as to&para;<br>facilitate informal, streamlined proceedings. Parties may agree to&para;<br>limit the issues subject to arbitration, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v.&para;<br>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628, to arbitrate accord&para;<br>ing to specific rules, Volt, supra, at 479, and to limit with whom they&para;<br>will arbitrate, Stolt-Nielsen, supra, at ___. Pp. 6–12.&para;<br>(d) Class arbitration, to the extent it is manufactured by Discover&para;<br>Bank rather than consensual, interferes with fundamental attributes&para;<br>of arbitration. The switch from bilateral to class arbitration sacri&para;<br>fices arbitration’s informality and makes the process slower, more&para;<br>costly, and more likely to generate procedural morass than final&para;<br>judgment. And class arbitration greatly increases risks to defen&para;<br>dants. The absence of multilayered review makes it more likely that&para;<br>errors will go uncorrected. That risk of error may become unaccept&para;<br>able when damages allegedly owed to thousands of claimants are ag&para;<br>gregated and decided at once. Arbitration is poorly suited to these&para;<br>higher stakes. In litigation, a defendant may appeal a certification&para;<br>decision and a final judgment, but 9 U. S. C. §10 limits the grounds&para;<br>on which courts can vacate arbitral awards. Pp. 12–18.&para;<br>&para;<br>584 F. 3d 849, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Laster v. AT&amp;T Mobility LLC, 584 F. 3d 849, 852,&para;<br>n. 1 (CA9 2009).&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>AT&amp;T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert 61a.2 The agreement authorized AT&amp;T to&para;<br>make unilateral amendments, which it did to the arbitra&para;<br>tion provision on several occasions. The version at issue in&para;<br>this case reflects revisions made in December 2006, which&para;<br>the parties agree are controlling.&para;<br>The revised agreement provides that customers may&para;<br>initiate dispute proceedings by completing a one-page No&para;<br>tice of Dispute form available on AT&amp;T’s Web site. AT&amp;T&para;<br>may then offer to settle the claim; if it does not, or if&para;<br>the dispute is not resolved within 30 days, the customer&para;<br>may invoke arbitration by filing a separate Demand for&para;<br>Arbitration, also available on AT&amp;T’s Web site. In the&para;<br>event the parties proceed to arbitration, the agreement&para;<br>specifies that AT&amp;T must pay all costs for nonfrivolous&para;<br>claims; that arbitration must take place in the county in&para;<br>which the customer is billed; that, for claims of $10,000 or&para;<br>less, the customer may choose whether the arbitration&para;<br>proceeds in person, by telephone, or based only on submis&para;<br>sions; that either party may bring a claim in small claims&para;<br>court in lieu of arbitration; and that the arbitrator may&para;<br>award any form of individual relief, including injunctions&para;<br>and presumably punitive damages. The agreement, more&para;<br>over, denies AT&amp;T any ability to seek reimbursement of&para;<br>its attorney’s fees, and, in the event that a customer re&para;<br>ceives an arbitration award greater than AT&amp;T’s last&para;<br>written settlement offer, requires AT&amp;T to pay a $7,500&para;<br>minimum recovery and twice the amount of the claimant’s&para;<br>attorney’s fees.3&para;<br>The Concepcions purchased AT&amp;T service, which was&para;<br>advertised as including the provision of free phones; they&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 That provision further states that “the arbitrator may not consoli&para;<br>date more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside&para;<br>over any form of a representative or class proceeding.” App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 61a.&para;<br>3 The guaranteed minimum recovery was increased in 2009 to&para;<br>$10,000.

In&para;<br>March 2006, the Concepcions filed a complaint against&para;<br>AT&amp;T in the United States District Court for the Southern&para;<br>District of California. The complaint was later consoli&para;<br>dated with a putative class action alleging, among other&para;<br>things, that AT&amp;T had engaged in false advertising and&para;<br>fraud by charging sales tax on phones it advertised as free.&para;<br>In March 2008, AT&amp;T moved to compel arbitration&para;<br>under the terms of its contract with the Concepcions. The&para;<br>Concepcions opposed the motion, contending that the ar&para;<br>bitration agreement was unconscionable and unlawfully&para;<br>exculpatory under California law because it disallowed&para;<br>classwide procedures. The District Court denied AT&amp;T’s&para;<br>motion. It described AT&amp;T’s arbitration agreement fa&para;<br>vorably, noting, for example, that the informal dispute&para;<br>resolution process was “quick, easy to use” and likely to&para;<br>“promp[t] full or . . . even excess payment to the customer&para;<br>without the need to arbitrate or litigate”; that the $7,500&para;<br>premium functioned as “a substantial inducement for the&para;<br>consumer to pursue the claim in arbitration” if a dispute&para;<br>was not resolved informally; and that consumers who were&para;<br>members of a class would likely be worse off. Laster v.&para;<br>T-Mobile USA, Inc., 2008 WL 5216255, *11–*12 (SD Cal.,&para;<br>Aug. 11, 2008). Nevertheless, relying on the California&para;<br>Supreme Court’s decision in Discover Bank v. Superior&para;<br>Court, 36 Cal. 4th 148, 113 P. 3d 1100 (2005), the court&para;<br>found that the arbitration provision was unconscionable&para;<br>because AT&amp;T had not shown that bilateral arbitration&para;<br>adequately substituted for the deterrent effects of class&para;<br>actions. Laster, 2008 WL 5216255, *14.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit affirmed, also finding the provision&para;<br>unconscionable under California law as announced in&para;<br>Discover Bank. Laster v. AT&amp;T Mobility LLC, 584 F. 3d&para;<br>849, 855 (2009). It also held that the Discover Bank rule&para;<br>was not preempted by the FAA because that rule was&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>AT&amp;T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>simply “a refinement of the unconscionability analysis&para;<br>applicable to contracts generally in California.” 584 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 857. In response to AT&amp;T’s argument that the Con&para;<br>cepcions’ interpretation of California law discriminated&para;<br>against arbitration, the Ninth Circuit rejected the conten&para;<br>tion that “ ‘class proceedings will reduce the efficiency and&para;<br>expeditiousness of arbitration’ ” and noted that “ ‘Discover&para;<br>Bank placed arbitration agreements with class action&para;<br>waivers on the exact same footing as contracts that bar&para;<br>class action litigation outside the context of arbitration.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at 858 (quoting Shroyer v. New Cingular Wireless&para;<br>Services, Inc., 498 F. 3d 976, 990 (CA9 2007)).&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 560 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The FAA was enacted in 1925 in response to widespread&para;<br>judicial hostility to arbitration agreements. See Hall&para;<br>Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. 576,&para;<br>581 (2008). Section 2, the “primary substantive provision&para;<br>of the Act,” Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury&para;<br>Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24 (1983), provides, in relevant&para;<br>part, as follows:&para;<br>“A written provision in any maritime transaction or&para;<br>a contract evidencing a transaction involving com&para;<br>merce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter&para;<br>arising out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be&para;<br>valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such&para;<br>grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation&para;<br>of any contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2.&para;<br>We have described this provision as reflecting both a&para;<br>“liberal federal policy favoring arbitration,” Moses H.&para;<br>Cone, supra, at 24, and the “fundamental principle that&para;<br>arbitration is a matter of contract,” Rent-A-Center, West,&para;<br>Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U. S. ____ , ____ (2010) (slip op., at 3).&para;<br>In line with these principles, courts must place arbitration&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>agreements on an equal footing with other contracts,&para;<br>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440,&para;<br>443 (2006), and enforce them according to their terms, Volt&para;<br>Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland&para;<br>Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 478 (1989).&para;<br>The final phrase of §2, however, permits arbitration&para;<br>agreements to be declared unenforceable “upon such&para;<br>grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of&para;<br>any contract.” This saving clause permits agreements to&para;<br>arbitrate to be invalidated by “generally applicable con&para;<br>tract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionabil&para;<br>ity,” but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or&para;<br>that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement&para;<br>to arbitrate is at issue. Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v.&para;<br>Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687 (1996); see also Perry v.&para;<br>Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 492–493, n. 9 (1987). The question&para;<br>in this case is whether §2 preempts California’s rule clas&para;<br>sifying most collective-arbitration waivers in consumer&para;<br>contracts as unconscionable. We refer to this rule as the&para;<br>Discover Bank rule.&para;<br>Under California law, courts may refuse to enforce any&para;<br>contract found “to have been unconscionable at the time it&para;<br>was made,” or may “limit the application of any uncon&para;<br>scionable clause.” Cal. Civ. Code Ann. §1670.5(a) (West&para;<br>1985). A finding of unconscionability requires “a ‘proce&para;<br>dural’ and a ‘substantive’ element, the former focusing on&para;<br>‘oppression’ or ‘surprise’ due to unequal bargaining power,&para;<br>the latter on ‘overly harsh’ or ‘one-sided’ results.” Armen&para;<br>dariz v. Foundation Health Pyschcare Servs., Inc., 24 Cal.&para;<br>4th 83, 114, 6 P. 3d 669, 690 (2000); accord, Discover&para;<br>Bank, 36 Cal. 4th, at 159–161, 113 P. 3d, at 1108.&para;<br>In Discover Bank, the California Supreme Court applied&para;<br>this framework to class-action waivers in arbitration&para;<br>agreements and held as follows:&para;<br>“[W]hen the waiver is found in a consumer contract of&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>AT&amp;T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the&para;<br>contracting parties predictably involve small amounts&para;<br>of damages, and when it is alleged that the party&para;<br>with the superior bargaining power has carried out a&para;<br>scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of con&para;<br>sumers out of individually small sums of money, then&para;<br>. . . the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of&para;<br>the party ‘from responsibility for [its] own fraud, or&para;<br>willful injury to the person or property of another.’&para;<br>Under these circumstances, such waivers are uncon&para;<br>scionable under California law and should not be en&para;<br>forced.” Id., at 162, 113 P. 3d, at 1110 (quoting Cal.&para;<br>Civ. Code Ann. §1668).&para;<br>California courts have frequently applied this rule to find&para;<br>arbitration agreements unconscionable. See, e.g., Cohen v.&para;<br>DirecTV, Inc., 142 Cal. App. 4th 1442, 1451–1453, 48 Cal.&para;<br>Rptr. 3d 813, 819–821 (2006); Klussman v. Cross Country&para;<br>Bank, 134 Cal. App. 4th 1283, 1297, 36 Cal Rptr. 3d 728,&para;<br>738–739 (2005); Aral v. EarthLink, Inc., 134 Cal. App. 4th&para;<br>544, 556–557, 36 Cal. Rptr. 3d 229, 237–239 (2005).&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Concepcions argue that the Discover Bank rule,&para;<br>given its origins in California’s unconscionability doctrine&para;<br>and California’s policy against exculpation, is a ground&para;<br>that “exist[s] at law or in equity for the revocation of any&para;<br>contract” under FAA §2. Moreover, they argue that even if&para;<br>we construe the Discover Bank rule as a prohibition on&para;<br>collective-action waivers rather than simply an application&para;<br>of unconscionability, the rule would still be applicable to&para;<br>all dispute-resolution contracts, since California prohibits&para;<br>waivers of class litigation as well. See America Online,&para;<br>Inc. v. Superior Ct., 90 Cal. App. 4th 1, 17–18, 108 Cal.&para;<br>Rptr. 2d 699, 711–713 (2001).&para;<br>When state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>particular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward:&para;<br>The conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA. Preston v.&para;<br>Ferrer, 552 U. S. 346, 353 (2008). But the inquiry becomes&para;<br>more complex when a doctrine normally thought to be&para;<br>generally applicable, such as duress or, as relevant here,&para;<br>unconscionability, is alleged to have been applied in a&para;<br>fashion that disfavors arbitration. In Perry v. Thomas,&para;<br>482 U. S. 483 (1987), for example, we noted that the FAA’s&para;<br>preemptive effect might extend even to grounds tradition&para;<br>ally thought to exist “ ‘at law or in equity for the revocation&para;<br>of any contract.’ ” Id., at 492, n. 9 (emphasis deleted). We&para;<br>said that a court may not “rely on the uniqueness of an&para;<br>agreement to arbitrate as a basis for a state-law holding&para;<br>that enforcement would be unconscionable, for this would&para;<br>enable the court to effect what . . . the state legislature&para;<br>cannot.” Id., at 493, n. 9.&para;<br>An obvious illustration of this point would be a case&para;<br>finding unconscionable or unenforceable as against public&para;<br>policy consumer arbitration agreements that fail to pro&para;<br>vide for judicially monitored discovery. The rationaliza&para;<br>tions for such a holding are neither difficult to imagine nor&para;<br>different in kind from those articulated in Discover Bank.&para;<br>A court might reason that no consumer would knowingly&para;<br>waive his right to full discovery, as this would enable&para;<br>companies to hide their wrongdoing. Or the court might&para;<br>simply say that such agreements are exculpatory—re&para;<br>stricting discovery would be of greater benefit to the&para;<br>company than the consumer, since the former is more&para;<br>likely to be sued than to sue. See Discover Bank, supra, at&para;<br>161, 113 P. 3d, at 1109 (arguing that class waivers are&para;<br>similarly one-sided). And, the reasoning would continue,&para;<br>because such a rule applies the general principle of uncon&para;<br>scionability or public-policy disapproval of exculpatory&para;<br>agreements, it is applicable to “any” contract and thus&para;<br>preserved by §2 of the FAA. In practice, of course, the rule&para;<br>would have a disproportionate impact on arbitration&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>AT&amp;T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>agreements; but it would presumably apply to contracts&para;<br>purporting to restrict discovery in litigation as well.&para;<br>Other examples are easy to imagine. The same argu&para;<br>ment might apply to a rule classifying as unconscionable&para;<br>arbitration agreements that fail to abide by the Federal&para;<br>Rules of Evidence, or that disallow an ultimate disposition&para;<br>by a jury (perhaps termed “a panel of twelve lay arbitra&para;<br>tors” to help avoid preemption). Such examples are not&para;<br>fanciful, since the judicial hostility towards arbitration&para;<br>that prompted the FAA had manifested itself in “a great&para;<br>variety” of “devices and formulas” declaring arbitration&para;<br>against public policy. Robert Lawrence Co. v. Devonshire&para;<br>Fabrics, Inc., 271 F. 2d 402, 406 (CA2 1959). And al&para;<br>though these statistics are not definitive, it is worth not&para;<br>ing that California’s courts have been more likely to hold&para;<br>contracts to arbitrate unconscionable than other contracts.&para;<br>Broome, An Unconscionable Application of the Uncon&para;<br>scionability Doctrine: How the California Courts are Cir&para;<br>cumventing the Federal Arbitration Act, 3 Hastings Bus.&para;<br>L.

Rev. 185, 186–187 (2004).&para;<br>The Concepcions suggest that all this is just a parade of&para;<br>horribles, and no genuine worry. “Rules aimed at destroy&para;<br>ing arbitration” or “demanding procedures incompatible&para;<br>with arbitration,” they concede, “would be preempted by&para;<br>the FAA because they cannot sensibly be reconciled with&para;<br>Section 2.” Brief for Respondents 32. The “grounds”&para;<br>available under §2’s saving clause, they admit, “should not&para;<br>be construed to include a State’s mere preference for pro&para;<br>cedures that are incompatible with arbitration and ‘would&para;<br>wholly eviscerate arbitration agreements.’ ” Id., at 33&para;<br>(quoting Carter v.

Section 2 makes arbitration agreements&para;<br>“valid, irrevocable, and enforceable” as written (subject, of&para;<br>course, to the saving clause); §3 requires courts to stay&para;<br>litigation of arbitral claims pending arbitration of those&para;<br>claims “in accordance with the terms of the agreement”;&para;<br>and §4 requires courts to compel arbitration “in accor&para;<br>dance with the terms of the agreement” upon the motion of&para;<br>either party to the agreement (assuming that the “making&para;<br>of the arbitration agreement or the failure . . . to perform&para;<br>the same” is not at issue).

The&para;<br>concluding paragraph of this part of its discussion begins&para;<br>as follows:&para;<br>“We therefore are not persuaded by the argument&para;<br>that the conflict between two goals of the Arbitration&para;<br>Act—enforcement of private agreements and encour&para;<br>agement of efficient and speedy dispute resolution—&para;<br>must be resolved in favor of the latter in order to real&para;<br>ize the intent of the drafters.” 470 U.

Although the rule does not require classwide&para;<br>arbitration, it allows any party to a consumer contract to&para;<br>demand it ex post. The rule is limited to adhesion con&para;<br>tracts, Discover Bank, 36 Cal. 4th, at 162–163, 113 P. 3d,&para;<br>at 1110, but the times in which consumer contracts were&para;<br>anything other than adhesive are long past.6 Carbajal v.&para;<br>H&amp;R Block Tax Servs., Inc., 372 F. 3d 903, 906 (CA7&para;<br>2004); see also Hill v.

[and] possessed roughly&para;<br>equivalent bargaining power.” Post, at 6. Such a limitation appears&para;<br>nowhere in the text of the FAA and has been explicitly rejected by our&para;<br>cases. “Relationships between securities dealers and investors, for&para;<br>example, may involve unequal bargaining power, but we [have] never&para;<br>theless held . . . that agreements to arbitrate in that context are en&para;<br>forceable.” Gilmer v.

Of course the dissent’s disquisition on legislative history&para;<br>fails to note that it contains nothing—not even the testimony of a stray&para;<br>witness in committee hearings—that contemplates the existence of&para;<br>class arbitration.&para;<br>6 Of course States remain free to take steps addressing the concerns&para;<br>that attend contracts of adhesion—for example, requiring class-action&para;<br>waiver provisions in adhesive agreements to be highlighted. Such steps&para;<br>cannot, however, conflict with the FAA or frustrate its purpose to&para;<br>ensure that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to&para;<br>their terms.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

This is obvious as a&para;<br>structural matter: Classwide arbitration includes absent&para;<br>parties, necessitating additional and different procedures&para;<br>and involving higher stakes. Confidentiality becomes&para;<br>more difficult. And while it is theoretically possible to&para;<br>select an arbitrator with some expertise relevant to the&para;<br>class-certification question, arbitrators are not generally&para;<br>knowledgeable in the often-dominant procedural aspects of&para;<br>certification, such as the protection of absent parties. The&para;<br>conclusion follows that class arbitration, to the extent it is&para;<br>manufactured by Discover Bank rather than consensual,&para;<br>is inconsistent with the FAA.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>AT&amp;T MOBILITY LLC v.

A cursory comparison of&para;<br>bilateral and class arbitration illustrates the difference.&para;<br>According to the American Arbitration Association (AAA),&para;<br>the average consumer arbitration between January and&para;<br>August 2007 resulted in a disposition on the merits in&para;<br>six months, four months if the arbitration was conducted&para;<br>by documents only.

And while&para;<br>parties can alter those procedures by contract, an alterna&para;<br>tive is not obvious. If procedures are too informal, absent&para;<br>class members would not be bound by the arbitration. For&para;<br>a class-action money judgment to bind absentees in litiga&para;<br>tion, class representatives must at all times adequately&para;<br>represent absent class members, and absent members&para;<br>must be afforded notice, an opportunity to be heard, and&para;<br>a right to opt out of the class.

At least this&para;<br>amount of process would presumably be required for ab&para;<br>sent parties to be bound by the results of arbitration.&para;<br>We find it unlikely that in passing the FAA Congress&para;<br>meant to leave the disposition of these procedural re&para;<br>quirements to an arbitrator. Indeed, class arbitration was&para;<br>not even envisioned by Congress when it passed the FAA&para;<br>in 1925; as the California Supreme Court admitted in&para;<br>Discover Bank, class arbitration is a “relatively recent&para;<br>development.” 36 Cal. 4th, at 163, 113 P. 3d, at 1110.&para;<br>And it is at the very least odd to think that an arbitrator&para;<br>would be entrusted with ensuring that third parties’ due&para;<br>process rights are satisfied.&para;<br>Third, class arbitration greatly increases risks to defen&para;<br>dants. Informal procedures do of course have a cost: The&para;<br>absence of multilayered review makes it more likely that&para;<br>errors will go uncorrected. Defendants are willing to&para;<br>accept the costs of these errors in arbitration, since their&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>trating a class is more desirable than litigating one, however, is not&para;<br>&para;<br>relevant. A State cannot defend a rule requiring arbitration-by-jury by&para;<br>&para;<br>saying that parties will still prefer it to trial-by-jury. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>AT&amp;T MOBILITY LLC v.

But when damages allegedly owed to tens of thou&para;<br>sands of potential claimants are aggregated and decided at&para;<br>once, the risk of an error will often become unacceptable.&para;<br>Faced with even a small chance of a devastating loss,&para;<br>defendants will be pressured into settling questionable&para;<br>claims. Other courts have noted the risk of “in terrorem”&para;<br>settlements that class actions entail, see, e.g., Kohen v.&para;<br>Pacific Inv. Management Co. LLC, 571 F. 3d 672, 677–678&para;<br>(CA7 2009), and class arbitration would be no different.&para;<br>Arbitration is poorly suited to the higher stakes of class&para;<br>litigation. In litigation, a defendant may appeal a certifi&para;<br>cation decision on an interlocutory basis and, if unsuccess&para;<br>ful, may appeal from a final judgment as well. Questions&para;<br>of law are reviewed de novo and questions of fact for clear&para;<br>error. In contrast, 9 U. S. C. §10 allows a court to vacate&para;<br>an arbitral award only where the award “was procured by&para;<br>corruption, fraud, or undue means”; “there was evident&para;<br>partiality or corruption in the arbitrators”; “the arbitrators&para;<br>were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the&para;<br>hearing . . . or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and&para;<br>material to the controversy[,] or of any other misbehavior&para;<br>by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced”; or&para;<br>if the “arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly&para;<br>executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award . . .&para;<br>was not made.” The AAA rules do authorize judicial re&para;<br>view of certification decisions, but this review is unlikely&para;<br>to have much effect given these limitations; review un&para;<br>der §10 focuses on misconduct rather than mistake.

Nor does the&para;<br>statute use a different word or phrase entirely that might&para;<br>arguably encompass validity, revocability, and enforce&para;<br>ability. The use of only “revocation” and the conspicuous&para;<br>omission of “invalidation” and “nonenforcement” suggest&para;<br>that the exception does not include all defenses applicable&para;<br>to any contract but rather some subset of those defenses.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001) (“It is our&para;<br>duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of&para;<br>a statute” (internal quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>Concededly, the difference between revocability, on the&para;<br>one hand, and validity and enforceability, on the other, is&para;<br>not obvious. The statute does not define the terms, and&para;<br>their ordinary meanings arguably overlap. Indeed, this&para;<br>Court and others have referred to the concepts of revoca&para;<br>bility, validity, and enforceability interchangeably. But&para;<br>this ambiguity alone cannot justify ignoring Congress’&para;<br>clear decision in §2 to repeat only one of the three&para;<br>concepts.&para;<br>To clarify the meaning of §2, it would be natural to look&para;<br>to other portions of the FAA. Statutory interpretation&para;<br>focuses on “the language itself, the specific context in&para;<br>which that language is used, and the broader context of&para;<br>the statute as a whole.” Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519&para;<br>U. S. 337, 341 (1997). “A provision that may seem am&para;<br>biguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of&para;<br>the statutory scheme . . . because only one of the permissi&para;<br>ble meanings produces a substantive effect that is com&para;<br>patible with the rest of the law.” United Sav. Assn. of Tex.&para;<br>v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S.&para;<br>365, 371 (1988).&para;<br>Examining the broader statutory scheme, §4 can be read&para;<br>to clarify the scope of §2’s exception to the enforcement of&para;<br>arbitration agreements. When a party seeks to enforce an&para;<br>arbitration agreement in federal court, §4 requires that&para;<br>“upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for&para;<br>arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in&para;<br>issue,” the court must order arbitration “in accordance&para;<br>with the terms of the agreement.”&para;<br>Reading §§2 and 4 harmoniously, the “grounds . . . for&para;<br>the revocation” preserved in §2 would mean grounds re&para;<br>lated to the making of the agreement. This would require&para;<br>enforcement of an agreement to arbitrate unless a party&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>AT&amp;T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION&para;<br>THOMAS, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>successfully asserts a defense concerning the formation of&para;<br>the agreement to arbitrate, such as fraud, duress, or mu&para;<br>tual mistake. See Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin&para;<br>Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403–404 (1967) (interpreting §4 to&para;<br>permit federal courts to adjudicate claims of “fraud in the&para;<br>inducement of the arbitration clause itself” because such&para;<br>claims “g[o] to the ‘making’ of the agreement to arbitrate”).&para;<br>Contract defenses unrelated to the making of the agree&para;<br>ment—such as public policy—could not be the basis for&para;<br>declining to enforce an arbitration clause.*&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* The interpretation I suggest would be consistent with our prece&para;<br>dent. Contract formation is based on the consent of the parties, and we&para;<br>have emphasized that “[a]rbitration under the Act is a matter of con&para;<br>sent.” Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland&para;<br>Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479 (1989).&para;<br>The statement in Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483 (1987), suggesting&para;<br>that §2 preserves all state-law defenses that “arose to govern issues&para;<br>concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts&para;<br>generally,” id., at 493, n. 9, is dicta. This statement is found in a&para;<br>footnote concerning a claim that the Court “decline[d] to address.” Id.,&para;<br>at 392, n. 9. Similarly, to the extent that statements in Rent-A-Center,&para;<br>West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U. S. ___, ___ n. 1 (2010) (slip op. at ___, n. 1),&para;<br>can be read to suggest anything about the scope of state-law defenses&para;<br>under §2, those statements are dicta, as well. This Court has never&para;<br>addressed the question whether the state-law “grounds” referred to in&para;<br>§2 are narrower than those applicable to any contract.&para;<br>Moreover, every specific contract defense that the Court has ac&para;<br>knowledged is applicable under §2 relates to contract formation. In&para;<br>Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687 (1996), this&para;<br>Court said that fraud, duress, and unconscionability “may be applied to&para;<br>invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening §2.” All three&para;<br>defenses historically concern the making of an agreement.

I think it does not.&para;<br>In Discover Bank, 36 Cal. 4th 148, 113 P. 3d 1100, the&para;<br>California Supreme Court held that “class action waivers&para;<br>are, under certain circumstances, unconscionable as unlaw&para;<br>fully exculpatory.” Id., at 65, 113 P. 3d, at 1112; see&para;<br>also id., at 161, 113 P. 3d, at 1108 (“[C]lass action waivers&para;<br>[may be] substantively unconscionable inasmuch as they&para;<br>may operate effectively as exculpatory contract clauses&para;<br>that are contrary to public policy”). The court concluded&para;<br>that where a class-action waiver is found in an arbitration&para;<br>agreement in certain consumer contracts of adhesion, such&para;<br>waivers “should not be enforced.” Id., at 163, 113 P. 3d, at&para;<br>1110. In practice, the court explained, such agreements&para;<br>“operate to insulate a party from liability that otherwise&para;<br>would be imposed under California law.” Id., at 161, 113&para;<br>P. 3d, at 1108, 1109. The court did not conclude that a&para;<br>customer would sign such an agreement only if under the&para;<br>influence of fraud, duress, or delusion.&para;<br>The court’s analysis and conclusion that the arbitration&para;<br>agreement was exculpatory reveals that the Discover Bank&para;<br>rule does not concern the making of the arbitration&para;<br>agreement. Exculpatory contracts are a paradigmatic ex&para;<br>ample of contracts that will not be enforced because of&para;<br>public policy. 15 G. Giesel, Corbin on Contracts §§85.1,&para;<br>85.17, 85.18 (rev. ed. 2003). Indeed, the court explained&para;<br>that it would not enforce the agreements because they are&para;<br>“ ‘against the policy of the law.’ ” 36 Cal. 4th, at 161, 113&para;<br>P. 3d, at 1108 (quoting Cal.

Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v.&para;<br>Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 219 (1985). We have described that&para;<br>purpose as one of “ensur[ing] judicial enforcement” of&para;<br>arbitration agreements.

The Act&para;<br>sought to eliminate that hostility by placing agreements to&para;<br>arbitrate “ ‘upon the same footing as other contracts.’ ”&para;<br>Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 511 (1974)&para;<br>(quoting H. R. Rep. No. 96, at 2; emphasis added).&para;<br>Congress was fully aware that arbitration could provide&para;<br>procedural and cost advantages. The House Report em­&para;<br>phasized the “appropriate[ness]” of making arbitration&para;<br>agreements enforceable “at this time when there is so&para;<br>much agitation against the costliness and delays of litiga­&para;<br>tion.” Id., at 2. And this Court has acknowledged that&para;<br>parties may enter into arbitration agreements in order to&para;<br>expedite the resolution of disputes. See Preston v. Ferrer,&para;<br>552 U.

S. 614, 628&para;<br>(1985).&para;<br>But we have also cautioned against thinking that Con­&para;<br>gress’ primary objective was to guarantee these particular&para;<br>procedural advantages. Rather, that primary objective&para;<br>was to secure the “enforcement” of agreements to arbi­&para;<br>trate. Dean Witter, 470 U. S., at 221. See also id., at 219&para;<br>(we “reject the suggestion that the overriding goal of the&para;<br>Arbitration Act was to promote the expeditious resolution&para;<br>of claims”); id., at 219, 217–218 (“[T]he intent of Congress”&para;<br>requires us to apply the terms of the Act without regard&para;<br>to whether the result would be “possibly inefficient”); cf.&para;<br>id., at 220 (acknowledging that “expedited resolution of&para;<br>disputes” might lead parties to prefer arbitration). The&para;<br>relevant Senate Report points to the Act’s basic purpose&para;<br>when it says that “[t]he purpose of the [Act] is clearly set&para;<br>forth in section 2,” S. Rep. No. 536, at 2 (emphasis added),&para;<br>namely, the section that says that an arbitration agree­&para;<br>ment “shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

C. §2.&para;<br>Thus, insofar as we seek to implement Congress’ intent,&para;<br>we should think more than twice before invalidating a&para;<br>state law that does just what §2 requires, namely, puts&para;<br>agreements to arbitrate and agreements to litigate “upon&para;<br>the same footing.”&para;<br>III&para;<br>The majority’s contrary view (that Discover Bank stands&para;<br>as an “obstacle” to the accomplishment of the federal law’s&para;<br>objective, ante, at 9–18) rests primarily upon its claims&para;<br>that the Discover Bank rule increases the complexity of&para;<br>arbitration procedures, thereby discouraging parties from&para;<br>entering into arbitration agreements, and to that extent&para;<br>discriminating in practice against arbitration. These&para;<br>claims are not well founded.&para;<br>For one thing, a state rule of law that would sometimes&para;<br>set aside as unconscionable a contract term that forbids&para;<br>class arbitration is not (as the majority claims) like a rule&para;<br>that would require “ultimate disposition by a jury” or&para;<br>“judicially monitored discovery” or use of “the Federal&para;<br>Rules of Evidence.” Ante, at 8, 9. Unlike the majority’s&para;<br>examples, class arbitration is consistent with the use of&para;<br>arbitration. It is a form of arbitration that is well known&para;<br>in California and followed elsewhere. See, e.g., Keating v.&para;<br>Superior Ct., 167 Cal. Rptr. 481, 492 (App. 1980) (officially&para;<br>depublished); American Arbitration Association (AAA),&para;<br>Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations (2003),&para;<br>http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=21936 (as visited Apr. 25,&para;<br>2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file); JAMS,&para;<br>The Resolution Experts, Class Action Procedures (2009).&para;<br>Indeed, the AAA has told us that it has found class ar­&para;<br>bitration to be “a fair, balanced, and efficient means of&para;<br>resolving class disputes.” Brief for AAA as Amicus Curiae&para;<br>in Stolt-Nielsen S.

Ante, at 9. The majority&para;<br>does not explain. And it is unlikely to be able to trace its&para;<br>present view to the history of the arbitration statute itself.&para;<br>When Congress enacted the Act, arbitration procedures&para;<br>had not yet been fully developed. Insofar as Congress&para;<br>considered detailed forms of arbitration at all, it may well&para;<br>have thought that arbitration would be used primarily&para;<br>where merchants sought to resolve disputes of fact, not&para;<br>law, under the customs of their industries, where the&para;<br>parties possessed roughly equivalent bargaining power.&para;<br>See Mitsubishi Motors, supra, at 646 (Stevens, J., dissent­&para;<br>ing); Joint Hearings on S. 1005 and H. R. 646 before the&para;<br>Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary, 68th&para;<br>Cong., 1st Sess., 15 (1924); Hearing on S. 4213 and S. 4214&para;<br>before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the&para;<br>Judiciary, 67th Cong., 4th Sess., 9–10 (1923); Dept. of&para;<br>Commerce, Secretary Hoover Favors Arbitration—Press&para;<br>Release (Dec. 28, 1925), Herbert Hoover Papers—Articles,&para;<br>Addresses, and Public Statements File—No. 536, p. 2&para;<br>(Herbert Hoover Presidential Library); Cohen &amp; Dayton,&para;<br>The New Federal Arbitration Law, 12 Va.

This last mentioned feature of the&para;<br>history—roughly equivalent bargaining power—suggests,&para;<br>if anything, that California’s statute is consistent with,&para;<br>and indeed may help to further, the objectives that Con­&para;<br>gress had in mind.&para;<br>Regardless, if neither the history nor present practice&para;<br>suggests that class arbitration is fundamentally incom­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

The majority compares&para;<br>the complexity of class arbitration with that of bilateral&para;<br>arbitration. See ante, at 14. And it finds the former more&para;<br>complex. See ibid. But, if incentives are at issue, the&para;<br>relevant comparison is not “arbitration with arbitration”&para;<br>but a comparison between class arbitration and judicial&para;<br>class actions. After all, in respect to the relevant set of&para;<br>contracts, the Discover Bank rule similarly and equally&para;<br>sets aside clauses that forbid class procedures—whether&para;<br>arbitration procedures or ordinary judicial procedures are&para;<br>at issue.&para;<br>Why would a typical defendant (say, a business) prefer a&para;<br>judicial class action to class arbitration? AAA statistics&para;<br>“suggest that class arbitration proceedings take more time&para;<br>than the average commercial arbitration, but may take&para;<br>less time than the average class action in court.” AAA&para;<br>Amicus Brief 24 (emphasis added). Data from California&para;<br>courts confirm that class arbitrations can take considera­&para;<br>bly less time than in-court proceedings in which class&para;<br>certification is sought. Compare ante, at 14 (providing&para;<br>statistics for class arbitration), with Judicial Council of&para;<br>California, Administrative Office of the Courts, Class&para;<br>Certification in California: Second Interim Report from&para;<br>the Study of California Class Action Litigation 18 (2010)&para;<br>(providing statistics for class-action litigation in California&para;<br>courts). And a single class proceeding is surely more&para;<br>efficient than thousands of separate proceedings for iden­&para;<br>tical claims. Thus, if speedy resolution of disputes were&para;<br>all that mattered, then the Discover Bank rule would&para;<br>reinforce, not obstruct, that objective of the Act.&para;<br>The majority’s related claim that the Discover Bank&para;<br>rule will discourage the use of arbitration because&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>AT&amp;T MOBILITY LLC v.

Loftus, Rivals&para;<br>Resolve Dispute Over Drug, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16,&para;<br>2011, p.

Y. Times, Nov. 30,&para;<br>1988, p. A1 (describing both companies as “pleased with&para;<br>the ruling” resolving a licensing dispute).&para;<br>Further, even though contract defenses, e.g., duress and&para;<br>unconscionability, slow down the dispute resolution proc­&para;<br>ess, federal arbitration law normally leaves such matters&para;<br>to the States. Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 4) (arbitration agreements&para;<br>“may be invalidated by ‘generally applicable contract&para;<br>defenses’ ” (quoting Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto,&para;<br>517 U. S. 681, 687 (1996))). A provision in a contract of&para;<br>adhesion (for example, requiring a consumer to decide&para;<br>very quickly whether to pursue a claim) might increase&para;<br>the speed and efficiency of arbitrating a dispute, but the&para;<br>State can forbid it. See, e.g., Hayes v. Oakridge Home, 122&para;<br>Ohio St. 3d 63, 67, 2009–Ohio–2054, ¶19, 908 N.

The Discover Bank rule&para;<br>amounts to a variation on this theme. California is free to&para;<br>define unconscionability as it sees fit, and its common law&para;<br>is of no federal concern so long as the State does not adopt&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

See also ante, at 4, n. (THOMAS, J.,&para;<br>concurring) (suggesting that, under certain circumstances,&para;<br>California might remain free to apply its unconscionability&para;<br>doctrine).&para;<br>Because California applies the same legal principles to&para;<br>address the unconscionability of class arbitration waivers&para;<br>as it does to address the unconscionability of any other&para;<br>contractual provision, the merits of class proceedings&para;<br>should not factor into our decision. If California had&para;<br>applied its law of duress to void an arbitration agreement,&para;<br>would it matter if the procedures in the coerced agreement&para;<br>were efficient?&para;<br>Regardless, the majority highlights the disadvantages of&para;<br>class arbitrations, as it sees them. See ante, at 15–16&para;<br>(referring to the “greatly increase[d] risks to defendants”;&para;<br>the “chance of a devastating loss” pressuring defendants&para;<br>“into settling questionable claims”). But class proceedings&para;<br>have countervailing advantages. In general agreements&para;<br>that forbid the consolidation of claims can lead small­&para;<br>dollar claimants to abandon their claims rather than to&para;<br>litigate. I suspect that it is true even here, for as the&para;<br>Court of Appeals recognized, AT&amp;T can avoid the $7,500&para;<br>payout (the payout that supposedly makes the Concep­&para;<br>cions’ arbitration worthwhile) simply by paying the claim’s&para;<br>face value, such that “the maximum gain to a customer for&para;<br>the hassle of arbitrating a $30.22 dispute is still just&para;<br>$30.22.” Laster v. AT&amp;T Mobility LLC, 584 F. 3d 849,&para;<br>855, 856 (CA9 2009).&para;<br>What rational lawyer would have signed on to represent&para;<br>the Concepcions in litigation for the possibility of fees&para;<br>stemming from a $30.22 claim? See, e.g., Carnegie v.&para;<br>Household Int’l, Inc., 376 F. 3d 656, 661 (CA7 2004) (“The&para;<br>realistic alternative to a class action is not 17 million&para;<br>individual suits, but zero individual suits, as only a luna­&para;<br>tic or a fanatic sues for $30”). In California’s perfectly&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>AT&amp;T MOBILITY LLC v. CONCEPCION&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>rational view, nonclass arbitration over such sums will&para;<br>also sometimes have the effect of depriving claimants of&para;<br>their claims (say, for example, where claiming the $30.22&para;<br>were to involve filling out many forms that require techni­&para;<br>cal legal knowledge or waiting at great length while a call&para;<br>is placed on hold). Discover Bank sets forth circumstances&para;<br>in which the California courts believe that the terms of&para;<br>consumer contracts can be manipulated to insulate an&para;<br>agreement’s author from liability for its own frauds by&para;<br>“deliberately cheat[ing] large numbers of consumers out&para;<br>of individually small sums of money.” 36 Cal. 4th, at&para;<br>162–163, 113 P. 3d, at 1110. Why is this kind of deci­&para;<br>sion—weighing the pros and cons of all class proceedings&para;<br>alike—not California’s to make?&para;<br>Finally, the majority can find no meaningful support for&para;<br>its views in this Court’s precedent. The federal Act has&para;<br>been in force for nearly a century. We have decided doz­&para;<br>ens of cases about its requirements. We have reached&para;<br>results that authorize complex arbitration procedures.&para;<br>E.g., Mitsubishi Motors, 473 U. S., at 629 (antitrust claims&para;<br>arising in international transaction are arbitrable). We&para;<br>have upheld nondiscriminatory state laws that slow down&para;<br>arbitration proceedings. E.g., Volt Information Sciences,&para;<br>489 U. S., at 477–479 (California law staying arbitration&para;<br>proceedings until completion of related litigation is not&para;<br>pre-empted). But we have not, to my knowledge, applied&para;<br>the Act to strike down a state statute that treats arbitra­&para;<br>tions on par with judicial and administrative proceedings.&para;<br>Cf. Preston, 552 U. S., at 355–356 (Act pre-empts state law&para;<br>that vests primary jurisdiction in state administrative&para;<br>board).&para;<br>At the same time, we have repeatedly referred to the&para;<br>Act’s basic objective as assuring that courts treat arbitra­&para;<br>tion agreements “like all other contracts.” Buckeye Check&para;<br>Cashing, Inc. v.
