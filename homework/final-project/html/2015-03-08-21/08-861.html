PUBLIC COM-&para;<br>&para;<br>PANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–861.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued December 7, 2009—Decided June 28, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, was&para;<br>created as part of a series of accounting reforms in the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002. The Board is composed of five members appointed&para;<br>by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was modeled on pri&para;<br>vate self-regulatory organizations in the securities industry—such as&para;<br>the New York Stock Exchange—that investigate and discipline their&para;<br>own members subject to Commission oversight. Unlike these organi&para;<br>zations, the Board is a Government-created entity with expansive&para;<br>powers to govern an entire industry. Every accounting firm that au&para;<br>dits public companies under the securities laws must register with&para;<br>the Board, pay it an annual fee, and comply with its rules and over&para;<br>sight. The Board may inspect registered firms, initiate formal inves&para;<br>tigations, and issue severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings.&para;<br>The parties agree that the Board is “part of the Government” for con&para;<br>stitutional purposes, Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corpora&para;<br>tion, 513 U. S. 374, 397, and that its members are “ ‘Officers of the&para;<br>United States’ ” who “exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the&para;<br>laws of the United States,” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 125–126.&para;<br>While the SEC has oversight of the Board, it cannot remove Board&para;<br>members at will, but only “for good cause shown,” “in accordance&para;<br>with” specified procedures. §§7211(e)(6), 7217(d)(3). The parties also&para;<br>agree that the Commissioners, in turn, cannot themselves be re&para;<br>moved by the President except for “ ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or&para;<br>malfeasance in office.’ ” Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295&para;<br>U. S. 602, 620.&para;<br>The Board inspected petitioner accounting firm, released a report&para;<br>critical of its auditing procedures, and began a formal investigation.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>The firm and petitioner Free Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit organiza&para;<br>tion of which the firm is a member, sued the Board and its members,&para;<br>seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that the Board is uncon&para;<br>stitutional and an injunction preventing the Board from exercising its&para;<br>powers. Petitioners argued that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contravened&para;<br>the separation of powers by conferring executive power on Board&para;<br>members without subjecting them to Presidential control. The basis&para;<br>for petitioners’ challenge was that Board members were insulated&para;<br>from Presidential control by two layers of tenure protection: Board&para;<br>members could only be removed by the Commission for good cause,&para;<br>and the Commissioners could in turn only be removed by the Presi&para;<br>dent for good cause. Petitioners also challenged the Board’s ap&para;<br>pointment as violating the Appointments Clause, which requires offi&para;<br>cers to be appointed by the President with the Senate’s advice and&para;<br>consent, or—in the case of “inferior Officers”—by “the President&para;<br>alone, . . . the Courts of Law, or . . . the Heads of Departments,”&para;<br>Art. II, §2, cl. 2. The United States intervened to defend the statute.&para;<br>The District Court found it had jurisdiction and granted summary&para;<br>judgment to respondents. The Court of Appeals affirmed. It first&para;<br>agreed that the District Court had jurisdiction. It then ruled that the&para;<br>dual restraints on Board members’ removal are permissible, and that&para;<br>Board members are inferior officers whose appointment is consistent&para;<br>with the Appointments Clause.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The District Court had jurisdiction over these claims. The&para;<br>Commission may review any Board rule or sanction, and an ag&para;<br>grieved party may challenge the Commission’s “final order” or “rule”&para;<br>in a court of appeals under 15 U. S. C. §78y. The Government reads&para;<br>§78y as an exclusive route to review, but the text does not expressly&para;<br>or implicitly limit the jurisdiction that other statutes confer on dis&para;<br>trict courts. It is presumed that Congress does not intend to limit ju&para;<br>risdiction if “a finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful ju&para;<br>dicial review”; if the suit is “ ‘wholly “collateral” ’ to a statute’s review&para;<br>provisions”; and if the claims are “outside the agency’s expertise.”&para;<br>Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U. S. 200, 212–213.&para;<br>These considerations point against any limitation on review here.&para;<br>Section 78y provides only for review of Commission action, and peti&para;<br>tioners’ challenge is “collateral” to any Commission orders or rules&para;<br>from which review might be sought. The Government advises peti&para;<br>tioners to raise their claims by appealing a Board sanction, but peti&para;<br>tioners have not been sanctioned, and it is no “meaningful” avenue of&para;<br>relief, Thunder Basin, supra, at 212, to require a plaintiff to incur a&para;<br>sanction in order to test a law’s validity, MedImmune, Inc. v. Genen&para;<br>tech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 129. Petitioners’ constitutional claims are&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>also outside the Commission’s competence and expertise, and the&para;<br>statutory questions involved do not require technical considerations&para;<br>of agency policy. Pp. 7–10.&para;<br>2. The dual for-cause limitations on the removal of Board members&para;<br>contravene the Constitution’s separation of powers. Pp. 10–27.&para;<br>(a) The Constitution provides that “[t]he executive Power shall be&para;<br>vested in a President of the United States of America.” Art. II, §1,&para;<br>cl. 1. Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to empower&para;<br>the President to keep executive officers accountable—by removing&para;<br>them from office, if necessary. See generally Myers v. United States,&para;<br>272 U. S. 52. This Court has determined that this authority is not&para;<br>without limit. In Humphrey’s Executor, supra, this Court held that&para;<br>Congress can, under certain circumstances, create independent agen&para;<br>cies run by principal officers appointed by the President, whom the&para;<br>President may not remove at will but only for good cause. And in&para;<br>United States v. Perkins, 116 U. S. 483, and Morrison v. Olson, 487&para;<br>U. S. 654, the Court sustained similar restrictions on the power of&para;<br>principal executive officers—themselves responsible to the Presi&para;<br>dent—to remove their own inferiors. However, this Court has not&para;<br>addressed the consequences of more than one level of good-cause ten&para;<br>ure. Pp. 10–14.&para;<br>(b) Where this Court has upheld limited restrictions on the&para;<br>President’s removal power, only one level of protected tenure sepa&para;<br>rated the President from an officer exercising executive power. The&para;<br>President—or a subordinate he could remove at will—decided&para;<br>whether the officer’s conduct merited removal under the good-cause&para;<br>standard. Here, the Act not only protects Board members from re&para;<br>moval except for good cause, but withdraws from the President any&para;<br>decision on whether that good cause exists. That decision is vested in&para;<br>other tenured officers—the Commissioners—who are not subject to&para;<br>the President’s direct control. Because the Commission cannot re&para;<br>move a Board member at will, the President cannot hold the Com&para;<br>mission fully accountable for the Board’s conduct. He can only review&para;<br>the Commissioner’s determination of whether the Act’s rigorous good&para;<br>cause standard is met. And if the President disagrees with that de&para;<br>termination, he is powerless to intervene—unless the determination&para;<br>is so unreasonable as to constitute “ ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or&para;<br>malfeasance in office.’ ” Humphrey’s Executor, supra, at 620.&para;<br>This arrangement contradicts Article II’s vesting of the executive&para;<br>power in the President. Without the ability to oversee the Board, or&para;<br>to attribute the Board’s failings to those whom he can oversee, the&para;<br>President is no longer the judge of the Board’s conduct. He can nei&para;<br>ther ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, nor be held respon&para;<br>sible for a Board member’s breach of faith. If this dispersion of re&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>sponsibility were allowed to stand, Congress could multiply it further&para;<br>by adding still more layers of good-cause tenure. Such diffusion of&para;<br>power carries with it a diffusion of accountability; without a clear and&para;<br>effective chain of command, the public cannot determine where the&para;<br>blame for a pernicious measure should fall. The Act’s restrictions are&para;<br>therefore incompatible with the Constitution’s separation of powers.&para;<br>Pp. 14–17.&para;<br>(c) The “ ‘fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, conven&para;<br>ient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing&para;<br>alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution. ” Bowsher&para;<br>v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 736. The Act’s multilevel tenure protections&para;<br>provide a blueprint for the extensive expansion of legislative power.&para;<br>Congress controls the salary, duties, and existence of executive of&para;<br>fices, and only Presidential oversight can counter its influence. The&para;<br>Framers created a structure in which “[a] dependence on the people”&para;<br>would be the “primary controul on the government,” and that de&para;<br>pendence is maintained by giving each branch “the necessary consti&para;<br>tutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the&para;<br>others.” The Federalist No. 51, p. 349. A key “constitutional means”&para;<br>vested in the President was “the power of appointing, overseeing, and&para;<br>controlling those who execute the laws.” 1 Annals of Congress 463.&para;<br>While a government of “opposite and rival interests” may sometimes&para;<br>inhibit the smooth functioning of administration, The Federalist No.&para;<br>51, at 349, “[t]he Framers recognized that, in the long term, struc&para;<br>tural protections against abuse of power were critical to preserving&para;<br>liberty.” Bowsher, supra, at 730. Pp. 17–21.&para;<br>(d) The Government errs in arguing that, even if some con&para;<br>straints on the removal of inferior executive officers might violate the&para;<br>Constitution, the restrictions here do not. There is no construction of&para;<br>the Commission’s good-cause removal power that is broad enough to&para;<br>avoid invalidation. Nor is the Commission’s broad power over Board&para;<br>functions the equivalent of a power to remove Board members. Alter&para;<br>ing the Board’s budget or powers is not a meaningful way to control&para;<br>an inferior officer; the Commission cannot supervise individual Board&para;<br>members if it must destroy the Board in order to fix it. Moreover, the&para;<br>Commission’s power over the Board is hardly plenary, as the Board&para;<br>may take significant enforcement actions largely independently of&para;<br>the Commission. Enacting new SEC rules through the required no&para;<br>tice and comment procedures would be a poor means of micro&para;<br>managing the Board, and without certain findings, the Act forbids&para;<br>any general rule requiring SEC preapproval of Board actions. Fi&para;<br>nally, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is highly unusual in committing sub&para;<br>stantial executive authority to officers protected by two layers of&para;<br>good-cause removal. Pp. 21–27.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>3. The unconstitutional tenure provisions are severable from the&para;<br>remainder of the statute. Because “[t]he unconstitutionality of a part&para;<br>of an Act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its re&para;<br>maining provisions,” Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Comm’n&para;<br>of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234, the “normal rule” is “that partial . . . in&para;<br>validation is the required course,” Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.,&para;<br>472 U. S. 491, 504. The Board’s existence does not violate the sepa&para;<br>ration of powers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed by&para;<br>§§7211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do. Concluding that the removal restric&para;<br>tions here are invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission&para;<br>at will. With the tenure restrictions excised, the Act remains “ ‘fully&para;<br>operative as a law,’ ” New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 186,&para;<br>and nothing in the Act’s text or historical context makes it “evident”&para;<br>that Congress would have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose&para;<br>members are removable at will, Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480&para;<br>U. S. 678, 684. The consequence is that the Board may continue to&para;<br>function as before, but its members may be removed at will by the&para;<br>Commission. Pp. 27–29.&para;<br>4. The Board’s appointment is consistent with the Appointments&para;<br>Clause. Pp. 29–33.&para;<br>(a) The Board members are inferior officers whose appointment&para;<br>Congress may permissibly vest in a “Hea[d] of Departmen[t].” Infe&para;<br>rior officers “are officers whose work is directed and supervised at&para;<br>some level” by superiors appointed by the President with the Senate’s&para;<br>consent. Edmond v. United States, 520 U. S. 651, 662–663. Because&para;<br>the good-cause restrictions discussed above are unconstitutional and&para;<br>void, the Commission possesses the power to remove Board members&para;<br>at will, in addition to its other oversight authority. Board members&para;<br>are therefore directed and supervised by the Commission. Pp. 29–30.&para;<br>(b) The Commission is a “Departmen[t]” under the Appointments&para;<br>Clause. Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 887, n. 4, specifi&para;<br>cally reserved the question whether a “principal agenc[y], such as”&para;<br>the SEC, is a “Departmen[t].” The Court now adopts the reasoning of&para;<br>the concurring Justices in Freytag, who would have concluded that&para;<br>the SEC is such a “Departmen[t]” because it is a freestanding compo&para;<br>nent of the Executive Branch not subordinate to or contained within&para;<br>any other such component. This reading is consistent with the com&para;<br>mon, near-contemporary definition of a “department”; with the early&para;<br>practice of Congress, see §3, 1 Stat. 234; and with this Court’s cases,&para;<br>which have never invalidated an appointment made by the head of&para;<br>such an establishment. Pp. 30–31.&para;<br>(c) The several Commissioners, and not the Chairman, are the&para;<br>Commission’s “Hea[d].” The Commission’s powers are generally&para;<br>vested in the Commissioners jointly, not the Chairman alone. The&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>Commissioners do not report to the Chairman, who exercises admin&para;<br>istrative functions subject to the full Commission’s policies. There is&para;<br>no reason why a multimember body may not be the “Hea[d]” of a&para;<br>“Departmen[t]” that it governs. The Appointments Clause necessar&para;<br>ily contemplates collective appointments by the “Courts of Law,”&para;<br>Art. II, §2, cl. 2, and each House of Congress appoints its officers col&para;<br>lectively, see, e.g., Art. I, §2, cl. 5. Practice has also sanctioned the&para;<br>appointment of inferior officers by multimember agencies.

Chadha, 462 U. S. 919,&para;<br>951 (1983). Article II vests “[t]he executive Power . . . in a&para;<br>President of the United States of America,” who must&para;<br>“take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Art. II,&para;<br>§1, cl. 1; id., §3. In light of “[t]he impossibility that one&para;<br>man should be able to perform all the great business of the&para;<br>State,” the Constitution provides for executive officers to&para;<br>“assist the supreme Magistrate in discharging the duties&para;<br>of his trust.” 30 Writings of George Washington 334 (J.&para;<br>Fitzpatrick ed. 1939).&para;<br>Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to&para;<br>empower the President to keep these officers account­&para;<br>able—by removing them from office, if necessary. See&para;<br>generally Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926).&para;<br>This Court has determined, however, that this authority is&para;<br>not without limit. In Humphrey’s Executor v. United&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), we held that Congress can,&para;<br>under certain circumstances, create independent agencies&para;<br>run by principal officers appointed by the President, whom&para;<br>the President may not remove at will but only for good&para;<br>cause. Likewise, in United States v. Perkins, 116 U. S. 483&para;<br>(1886), and Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988), the&para;<br>Court sustained similar restrictions on the power of prin­&para;<br>cipal executive officers—themselves responsible to the&para;<br>President—to remove their own inferiors. The parties do&para;<br>not ask us to reexamine any of these precedents, and we&para;<br>do not do so.&para;<br>We are asked, however, to consider a new situation not&para;<br>yet encountered by the Court. The question is whether&para;<br>these separate layers of protection may be combined. May&para;<br>the President be restricted in his ability to remove a prin­&para;<br>cipal officer, who is in turn restricted in his ability to&para;<br>remove an inferior officer, even though that inferior officer&para;<br>determines the policy and enforces the laws of the United&para;<br>States?&para;<br>We hold that such multilevel protection from removal is&para;<br>contrary to Article II’s vesting of the executive power in&para;<br>the President. The President cannot “take Care that the&para;<br>Laws be faithfully executed” if he cannot oversee the&para;<br>faithfulness of the officers who execute them. Here the&para;<br>President cannot remove an officer who enjoys more than&para;<br>one level of good-cause protection, even if the President&para;<br>determines that the officer is neglecting his duties or&para;<br>discharging them improperly. That judgment is instead&para;<br>committed to another officer, who may or may not agree&para;<br>with the President’s determination, and whom the Presi­&para;<br>dent cannot remove simply because that officer disagrees&para;<br>with him. This contravenes the President’s “constitutional&para;<br>obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.”&para;<br>Id., at 693.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

The Board&para;<br>is composed of five members, appointed to staggered 5­&para;<br>year terms by the Securities and Exchange Commission.&para;<br>It was modeled on private self-regulatory organizations in&para;<br>the securities industry—such as the New York Stock&para;<br>Exchange—that investigate and discipline their own&para;<br>members subject to Commission oversight.

The willful violation of any Board&para;<br>rule is treated as a willful violation of the Securities Ex­&para;<br>change Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 881, 15 U. S. C. §78a et seq.—&para;<br>a federal crime punishable by up to 20 years’ imprison­&para;<br>ment or $25 million in fines ($5 million for a natural per­&para;<br>son). §§78ff(a), 7202(b)(1) (2006 ed.).

Petitioners also challenged the Act under&para;<br>the Appointments Clause, which requires “Officers of the&para;<br>United States” to be appointed by the President with the&para;<br>Senate’s advice and consent. Art. II, §2, cl. 2. The Clause&para;<br>provides an exception for “inferior Officers,” whose ap­&para;<br>pointment Congress may choose to vest “in the President&para;<br>alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart­&para;<br>ments.” Ibid. Because the Board is appointed by the SEC,&para;<br>petitioners argued that (1) Board members are not “infe­&para;<br>rior Officers” who may be appointed by “Heads of Depart­&para;<br>ments”; (2) even if they are, the Commission is not a “De­&para;<br>partmen[t]”; and (3) even if it is, the several&para;<br>Commissioners (as opposed to the Chairman) are not its&para;<br>“Hea[d].” See App. 68–70. The United States intervened&para;<br>to defend the Act’s constitutionality. Both sides moved for&para;<br>summary judgment; the District Court determined that it&para;<br>had jurisdiction and granted summary judgment to re­&para;<br>spondents.

On the mer­&para;<br>its, the Court of Appeals recognized that the removal issue&para;<br>was “a question of first impression,” as neither that court&para;<br>nor this one “ha[d] considered a situation where a restric­&para;<br>tion on removal passes through two levels of control.” Id.,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

It ruled that the dual restraints on Board mem­&para;<br>bers’ removal are permissible because they do not “render&para;<br>the President unable to perform his constitutional duties.”&para;<br>Id., at 683. The majority reasoned that although the&para;<br>President “does not directly select or supervise the Board’s&para;<br>members,” id., at 681, the Board is subject to the compre­&para;<br>hensive control of the Commission, and thus the Presi­&para;<br>dent’s influence over the Commission implies a constitu­&para;<br>tionally sufficient influence over the Board as well. Id., at&para;<br>682–683. The majority also held that Board members are&para;<br>inferior officers subject to the Commission’s direction and&para;<br>supervision, id., at 672–676, and that their appointment is&para;<br>otherwise consistent with the Appointments Clause, id., at&para;<br>676–678.&para;<br>Judge Kavanaugh dissented. He agreed that the case&para;<br>was one of first impression, id., at 698, but argued that&para;<br>“the double for-cause removal provisions in the [Act] . . .&para;<br>combine to eliminate any meaningful Presidential control&para;<br>over the [Board],” id., at 697. Judge Kavanaugh also&para;<br>argued that Board members are not effectively supervised&para;<br>by the Commission and thus cannot be inferior officers&para;<br>under the Appointments Clause. Id., at 709–712.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>We first consider whether the District Court had juris­&para;<br>diction. We agree with both courts below that the statutes&para;<br>providing for judicial review of Commission action did not&para;<br>prevent the District Court from considering petitioners’&para;<br>claims.&para;<br>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act empowers the Commission to&para;<br>review any Board rule or sanction. See 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§7217(b)(2)–(4), (c)(2).

But the text does not expressly limit the jurisdic­&para;<br>tion that other statutes confer on district courts. See, e.g.,&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §§1331, 2201. Nor does it do so implicitly.&para;<br>Provisions for agency review do not restrict judicial review&para;<br>unless the “statutory scheme” displays a “fairly discerni­&para;<br>ble” intent to limit jurisdiction, and the claims at issue&para;<br>“are of the type Congress intended to be reviewed within&para;<br>th[e] statutory structure.” Thunder Basin Coal Co. v.&para;<br>Reich, 510 U. S. 200, 207, 212 (1994) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). Generally, when Congress creates proce­&para;<br>dures “designed to permit agency expertise to be brought&para;<br>to bear on particular problems,” those procedures “are to&para;<br>be exclusive.” Whitney Nat. Bank in Jefferson Parish v.&para;<br>Bank of New Orleans &amp; Trust Co., 379 U. S. 411, 420&para;<br>(1965). But we presume that Congress does not intend to&para;<br>limit jurisdiction if “a finding of preclusion could foreclose&para;<br>all meaningful judicial review”; if the suit is “wholly col­&para;<br>lateral to a statute’s review provisions”; and if the claims&para;<br>are “outside the agency’s expertise.” Thunder Basin,&para;<br>supra, at 212–213 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>These considerations point against any limitation on&para;<br>review here.&para;<br>We do not see how petitioners could meaningfully pur­&para;<br>sue their constitutional claims under the Government’s&para;<br>theory. Section 78y provides only for judicial review of&para;<br>Commission action, and not every Board action is encapsu­&para;<br>lated in a final Commission order or rule.&para;<br>The Government suggests that petitioners could first&para;<br>have sought Commission review of the Board’s “auditing&para;<br>standards, registration requirements, or other rules.”&para;<br>Brief for United States 16.

Cf. McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center,&para;<br>Inc., 498 U. S. 479, 491–492 (1991). Requiring petitioners&para;<br>to select and challenge a Board rule at random is an odd&para;<br>procedure for Congress to choose, especially because only&para;<br>new rules, and not existing ones, are subject to challenge.&para;<br>See 15 U.

Brief for&para;<br>United States 16–17. But the investigation of Beckstead&para;<br>and Watts produced no sanction, see id., at 7, n. 5; Reply&para;<br>Brief for Petitioners 29, n. 11 (hereinafter Reply Brief),&para;<br>and an uncomplimentary inspection report is not subject&para;<br>to judicial review, see §7214(h)(2). So the Government&para;<br>proposes that Beckstead and Watts incur a sanction (such&para;<br>as a sizable fine) by ignoring Board requests for docu­&para;<br>ments and testimony. Brief for United States 17. If the&para;<br>Commission then affirms, the firm will win access to a&para;<br>court of appeals—and severe punishment should its chal­&para;<br>lenge fail. We normally do not require plaintiffs to “bet&para;<br>the farm . . . by taking the violative action” before “testing&para;<br>the validity of the law,” MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech,&para;<br>Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 129 (2007); accord, Ex parte Young,&para;<br>209 U. S. 123 (1908), and we do not consider this a “mean­&para;<br>ingful” avenue of relief. Thunder Basin, 510 U. S., at 212.&para;<br>Petitioners’ constitutional claims are also outside the&para;<br>Commission’s competence and expertise. In Thunder&para;<br>Basin, the petitioner’s primary claims were statutory; “at&para;<br>root . . . [they] ar[o]se under the Mine Act and f[e]ll&para;<br>squarely within the [agency’s] expertise,” given that the&para;<br>agency had “extensive experience” on the issue and had&para;<br>“recently addressed the precise . . . claims presented.” Id.,&para;<br>at 214–215. Likewise, in United States v. Ruzicka, 329&para;<br>U.

Id., at 294.&para;<br>No similar expertise is required here, and the statutory&para;<br>questions involved do not require “technical considerations&para;<br>of [agency] policy.” Johnson v. Robison, 415 U. S. 361, 373&para;<br>(1974). They are instead standard questions of adminis­&para;<br>trative law, which the courts are at no disadvantage in&para;<br>answering.&para;<br>We therefore conclude that §78y did not strip the Dis­&para;<br>trict Court of jurisdiction over these claims, which are&para;<br>properly presented for our review.2&para;<br>III&para;<br>We hold that the dual for-cause limitations on the re­&para;<br>moval of Board members contravene the Constitution’s&para;<br>separation of powers.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Constitution provides that “[t]he executive Power&para;<br>shall be vested in a President of the United States of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The Government asserts that “petitioners have not pointed to any&para;<br>case in which this Court has recognized an implied private right of&para;<br>action directly under the Constitution to challenge governmental action&para;<br>under the Appointments Clause or separation-of-powers principles.”&para;<br>Brief for United States 22. The Government does not appear to dispute&para;<br>such a right to relief as a general matter, without regard to the particu­&para;<br>lar constitutional provisions at issue here. See, e.g., Correctional&para;<br>Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S. 61, 74 (2001) (equitable relief “has&para;<br>long been recognized as the proper means for preventing entities from&para;<br>acting unconstitutionally”); Bell v. Hood, 327 U.

S. 123, 149, 165, 167&para;<br>(1908). If the Government’s point is that an Appointments Clause or&para;<br>separation-of-powers claim should be treated differently than every&para;<br>other constitutional claim, it offers no reason and cites no authority&para;<br>why that might be so.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

As Madison stated on the floor&para;<br>of the First Congress, “if any power whatsoever is in its&para;<br>nature Executive, it is the power of appointing, overseeing,&para;<br>and controlling those who execute the laws.” 1 Annals of&para;<br>Cong. 463 (1789).&para;<br>The removal of executive officers was discussed exten­&para;<br>sively in Congress when the first executive departments&para;<br>were created. The view that “prevailed, as most consonant&para;<br>to the text of the Constitution” and “to the requisite re­&para;<br>sponsibility and harmony in the Executive Department,”&para;<br>was that the executive power included a power to oversee&para;<br>executive officers through removal; because that tradi­&para;<br>tional executive power was not “expressly taken away, it&para;<br>remained with the President.” Letter from James Madi­&para;<br>son to Thomas Jefferson (June 30, 1789), 16 Documentary&para;<br>History of the First Federal Congress 893 (2004). “This&para;<br>Decision of 1789 provides contemporaneous and weighty&para;<br>evidence of the Constitution’s meaning since many of the&para;<br>Members of the First Congress had taken part in framing&para;<br>that instrument.” Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 723–&para;<br>724 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). And it&para;<br>soon became the “settled and well understood construction&para;<br>of the Constitution.” Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 259&para;<br>(1839).&para;<br>The landmark case of Myers v. United States reaffirmed&para;<br>the principle that Article II confers on the President “the&para;<br>general administrative control of those executing the&para;<br>laws.” 272 U. S., at 164. It is his responsibility to take&para;<br>care that the laws be faithfully executed. The buck stops&para;<br>with the President, in Harry Truman’s famous phrase. As&para;<br>we explained in Myers, the President therefore must have&para;<br>some “power of removing those for whom he can not con­&para;<br>tinue to be responsible.” Id., at 117.&para;<br>Nearly a decade later in Humphrey’s Executor, this&para;<br>Court held that Myers did not prevent Congress from&para;<br>conferring good-cause tenure on the principal officers of&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

That case concerned the&para;<br>members of the Federal Trade Commission, who held 7­&para;<br>year terms and could not be removed by the President&para;<br>except for “ ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in&para;<br>office.’ ” 295 U. S., at 620 (quoting 15 U. S. C. §41). The&para;<br>Court distinguished Myers on the ground that Myers&para;<br>concerned “an officer [who] is merely one of the units in&para;<br>the executive department and, hence, inherently subject to&para;<br>the exclusive and illimitable power of removal by the Chief&para;<br>Executive, whose subordinate and aid he is.” 295 U. S., at&para;<br>627. By contrast, the Court characterized the FTC as&para;<br>“quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial” rather than “purely&para;<br>executive,” and held that Congress could require it “to act&para;<br>. . . independently of executive control.” Id., at 627–629.&para;<br>Because “one who holds his office only during the pleasure&para;<br>of another, cannot be depended upon to maintain an atti­&para;<br>tude of independence against the latter’s will,” the Court&para;<br>held that Congress had power to “fix the period during&para;<br>which [the Commissioners] shall continue in office, and to&para;<br>forbid their removal except for cause in the meantime.”&para;<br>Id., at 629.&para;<br>Humphrey’s Executor did not address the removal of&para;<br>inferior officers, whose appointment Congress may vest in&para;<br>heads of departments. If Congress does so, it is ordinarily&para;<br>the department head, rather than the President, who&para;<br>enjoys the power of removal. See Myers, supra, at 119,&para;<br>127; Hennen, supra, at 259–260. This Court has upheld&para;<br>for-cause limitations on that power as well.&para;<br>In Perkins, a naval cadet-engineer was honorably dis­&para;<br>charged from the Navy because his services were no longer&para;<br>required. 116 U.

Stat. §§1229, 1525. This Court adopted&para;<br>verbatim the reasoning of the Court of Claims, which had&para;<br>held that when Congress “ ‘vests the appointment of infe­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 485. Because Perkins had&para;<br>not been “ ‘dismissed for misconduct . . . [or upon] the&para;<br>sentence of a court-martial,’ ” the Court agreed that he was&para;<br>“ ‘still in office and . . . entitled to [his] pay.’ ” Ibid.3&para;<br>We again considered the status of inferior officers in&para;<br>Morrison. That case concerned the Ethics in Government&para;<br>Act, which provided for an independent counsel to investi­&para;<br>gate allegations of crime by high executive officers. The&para;<br>counsel was appointed by a special court, wielded the full&para;<br>powers of a prosecutor, and was removable by the Attor­&para;<br>ney General only “ ‘for good cause.’ ” 487 U. S., at 663&para;<br>(quoting 28 U. S. C. §596(a)(1)). We recognized that the&para;<br>independent counsel was undoubtedly an executive officer,&para;<br>rather than “ ‘quasi-legislative’ ” or “ ‘quasi-judicial,’ ” but&para;<br>we stated as “our present considered view” that Congress&para;<br>had power to impose good-cause restrictions on her re­&para;<br>moval. 487 U. S., at 689–691. The Court noted that the&para;<br>statute “g[a]ve the Attorney General,” an officer directly&para;<br>responsible to the President and “through [whom]” the&para;<br>President could act, “several means of supervising or&para;<br>controlling” the independent counsel—“[m]ost importantly&para;<br>. . . the power to remove the counsel for good cause.” Id.,&para;<br>at 695–696 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 When Perkins was decided in 1886, the Secretary of the Navy was a&para;<br>principal officer and the head of a department, see Rev. Stat. §415, and&para;<br>the Tenure of Office Act purported to require Senate consent for his&para;<br>removal. Ch. 154, 14 Stat. 430, Rev. Stat. §1767. This requirement&para;<br>was widely regarded as unconstitutional and void (as it is universally&para;<br>regarded today), and it was repealed the next year. See Act of Mar. 3,&para;<br>1887, ch. 353, 24 Stat. 500; Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 167–&para;<br>168 (1926); see also Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.

In those cases,&para;<br>however, only one level of protected tenure separated the&para;<br>President from an officer exercising executive power. It&para;<br>was the President—or a subordinate he could remove at&para;<br>will—who decided whether the officer’s conduct merited&para;<br>removal under the good-cause standard.&para;<br>The Act before us does something quite different. It not&para;<br>only protects Board members from removal except for good&para;<br>cause, but withdraws from the President any decision on&para;<br>whether that good cause exists. That decision is vested&para;<br>instead in other tenured officers—the Commissioners—&para;<br>none of whom is subject to the President’s direct control.&para;<br>The result is a Board that is not accountable to the Presi­&para;<br>dent, and a President who is not responsible for the Board.&para;<br>The added layer of tenure protection makes a difference.&para;<br>Without a layer of insulation between the Commission and&para;<br>the Board, the Commission could remove a Board member&para;<br>at any time, and therefore would be fully responsible for&para;<br>what the Board does. The President could then hold the&para;<br>Commission to account for its supervision of the Board, to&para;<br>the same extent that he may hold the Commission to&para;<br>account for everything else it does.&para;<br>A second level of tenure protection changes the nature of&para;<br>the President’s review. Now the Commission cannot&para;<br>remove a Board member at will. The President therefore&para;<br>cannot hold the Commission fully accountable for the&para;<br>Board’s conduct, to the same extent that he may hold the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

They are only responsible for their own determi­&para;<br>nation of whether the Act’s rigorous good-cause standard&para;<br>is met. And even if the President disagrees with their&para;<br>determination, he is powerless to intervene—unless that&para;<br>determination is so unreasonable as to constitute “ineffi­&para;<br>ciency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Hum&para;<br>phrey’s Executor, 295 U. S., at 620 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted).&para;<br>This novel structure does not merely add to the Board’s&para;<br>independence, but transforms it. Neither the President,&para;<br>nor anyone directly responsible to him, nor even an officer&para;<br>whose conduct he may review only for good cause, has full&para;<br>control over the Board. The President is stripped of the&para;<br>power our precedents have preserved, and his ability to&para;<br>execute the laws—by holding his subordinates accountable&para;<br>for their conduct—is impaired.&para;<br>That arrangement is contrary to Article II’s vesting of&para;<br>the executive power in the President. Without the ability&para;<br>to oversee the Board, or to attribute the Board’s failings to&para;<br>those whom he can oversee, the President is no longer the&para;<br>judge of the Board’s conduct. He is not the one who de­&para;<br>cides whether Board members are abusing their offices or&para;<br>neglecting their duties. He can neither ensure that the&para;<br>laws are faithfully executed, nor be held responsible for a&para;<br>Board member’s breach of faith. This violates the basic&para;<br>principle that the President “cannot delegate ultimate&para;<br>responsibility or the active obligation to supervise that&para;<br>goes with it,” because Article II “makes a single President&para;<br>responsible for the actions of the Executive Branch.”&para;<br>Clinton v.

If Congress can shelter the&para;<br>bureaucracy behind two layers of good-cause tenure, why&para;<br>not a third?

The officers of such an agency—safely encased&para;<br>within a Matryoshka doll of tenure protections—would be&para;<br>immune from Presidential oversight, even as they exer­&para;<br>cised power in the people’s name.&para;<br>Perhaps an individual President might find advantages&para;<br>in tying his own hands. But the separation of powers does&para;<br>not depend on the views of individual Presidents, see&para;<br>Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.

The President can always choose to restrain&para;<br>himself in his dealings with subordinates. He cannot,&para;<br>however, choose to bind his successors by diminishing&para;<br>their powers, nor can he escape responsibility for his&para;<br>choices by pretending that they are not his own.&para;<br>The diffusion of power carries with it a diffusion of&para;<br>accountability. The people do not vote for the “Officers of&para;<br>the United States.” Art. II, §2, cl. 2.

The dissent describes this conflict merely&para;<br>as one of four possible “scenarios,” see post, at 12–13, but it is the&para;<br>central issue in this case: The second layer matters precisely when the&para;<br>President finds it necessary to have a subordinate officer removed, and&para;<br>a statute prevents him from doing so.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

But where, in all this, is the&para;<br>role for oversight by an elected President? The Constitu­&para;<br>tion requires that a President chosen by the entire Nation&para;<br>oversee the execution of the laws. And the “ ‘fact that a&para;<br>given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful&para;<br>in facilitating functions of government, standing alone,&para;<br>will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution,’ ” for&para;<br>“ ‘[c]onvenience and efficiency are not the primary objec­&para;<br>tives—or the hallmarks—of democratic government.’ ”&para;<br>Bowsher, 478 U.

S., at&para;<br>944).&para;<br>One can have a government that functions without&para;<br>being ruled by functionaries, and a government that bene­&para;<br>fits from expertise without being ruled by experts. Our&para;<br>Constitution was adopted to enable the people to govern&para;<br>themselves, through their elected leaders. The growth of&para;<br>the Executive Branch, which now wields vast power and&para;<br>touches almost every aspect of daily life, heightens the&para;<br>concern that it may slip from the Executive’s control, and&para;<br>thus from that of the people. This concern is largely ab­&para;<br>sent from the dissent’s paean to the administrative state.&para;<br>For example, the dissent dismisses the importance of&para;<br>removal as a tool of supervision, concluding that the Presi­&para;<br>dent’s “power to get something done” more often depends&para;<br>on “who controls the agency’s budget requests and fund­&para;<br>ing, the relationships between one agency or department&para;<br>and another, . . . purely political factors (including Con­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Post, at 11, 13 (emphasis deleted). The&para;<br>Framers did not rest our liberties on such bureaucratic&para;<br>minutiae. As we said in Bowsher, supra, at 730, “[t]he&para;<br>separated powers of our Government cannot be permitted&para;<br>to turn on judicial assessment of whether an officer exer­&para;<br>cising executive power is on good terms with Congress.”&para;<br>In fact, the multilevel protection that the dissent en­&para;<br>dorses “provides a blueprint for extensive expansion of the&para;<br>legislative power.” MWAA, supra, at 277. In a system of&para;<br>checks and balances, “[p]ower abhors a vacuum,” and one&para;<br>branch’s handicap is another’s strength. 537 F. 3d, at 695,&para;<br>n. 4 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). “Even when a branch does not arrogate power to&para;<br>itself,” therefore, it must not “impair another in the per­&para;<br>formance of its constitutional duties.” Loving v. United&para;<br>States, 517 U. S. 748, 757 (1996).5 Congress has plenary&para;<br>control over the salary, duties, and even existence of ex­&para;<br>ecutive offices. Only Presidential oversight can counter its&para;<br>influence. That is why the Constitution vests certain&para;<br>powers in the President that “the Legislature has no right&para;<br>to diminish or modify.” 1 Annals of Cong., at 463 (J.&para;<br>Madison).6&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The dissent quotes Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 138 (1976) (per&para;<br>curiam), for the proposition that Congress has “broad authority to&para;<br>‘create’ governmental ‘ “offices” ’ and to structure those offices ‘as it&para;<br>chooses.’ ” Post, at 2. The Buckley Court put “ ‘offices’ ” in quotes&para;<br>because it was actually describing legislative positions that are not&para;<br>really offices at all (at least not under Article II).

See post, at 17–18. But Madison’s actual proposal, consistent&para;<br>with his view of the Constitution, was that the Comptroller hold office&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>The Framers created a structure in which “[a] depend­&para;<br>ence on the people” would be the “primary controul on the&para;<br>government.” The Federalist No. 51, at 349 (J. Madison).&para;<br>That dependence is maintained, not just by “parchment&para;<br>barriers,” id., No. 48, at 333 (same), but by letting&para;<br>“[a]mbition . . . counteract ambition,” giving each branch&para;<br>“the necessary constitutional means, and personal mo­&para;<br>tives, to resist encroachments of the others,” id., No. 51, at&para;<br>349. A key “constitutional means” vested in the Presi­&para;<br>dent—perhaps the key means—was “the power of appoint­&para;<br>ing, overseeing, and controlling those who execute the&para;<br>laws.” 1 Annals of Cong., at 463. And while a government&para;<br>of “opposite and rival interests” may sometimes inhibit the&para;<br>smooth functioning of administration, The Federalist No.&para;<br>51, at 349, “[t]he Framers recognized that, in the long&para;<br>term, structural protections against abuse of power were&para;<br>critical to preserving liberty.” Bowsher, supra, at 730.&para;<br>Calls to abandon those protections in light of “the era’s&para;<br>perceived necessity,” New York, 505 U. S., at 187, are not&para;<br>unusual. Nor is the argument from bureaucratic expertise&para;<br>limited only to the field of accounting. The failures of&para;<br>accounting regulation may be a “pressing national prob­&para;<br>lem,” but “a judiciary that licensed extraconstitutional&para;<br>government with each issue of comparable gravity would,&para;<br>in the long run, be far worse.” Id., at 187–188. Neither&para;<br>respondents nor the dissent explains why the Board’s&para;<br>task, unlike so many others, requires more than one layer&para;<br>of insulation from the President—or, for that matter, why&para;<br>only two. The point is not to take issue with for-cause&para;<br>limitations in general; we do not do that. The question&para;<br>here is far more modest. We deal with the unusual situa­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>for a term of “years, unless sooner removed by the President”; he would&para;<br>thus be “dependent upon the President, because he can be removed by&para;<br>him,” and also “dependent upon the Senate, because they must consent&para;<br>to his [reappointment] for every term of years.” 1 Annals of Cong. 612&para;<br>(1789).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

See Brief for United States 47. It contends,&para;<br>however, that the removal restrictions at issue here do&para;<br>not.&para;<br>To begin with, the Government argues that the Com­&para;<br>mission’s removal power over the Board is “broad,” and&para;<br>could be construed as broader still, if necessary to avoid&para;<br>invalidation.

See Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 41–43, 45–46. Nor do our precedents suggest as&para;<br>much. Humphrey’s Executor, for example, rejected a&para;<br>removal premised on a lack of agreement “ ‘on either the&para;<br>policies or the administering of the Federal Trade Com­&para;<br>mission,’ ” because the FTC was designed to be “ ‘inde­&para;<br>pendent in character,’ ” “free from ‘political domination or&para;<br>control,’ ” and not “ ‘subject to anybody in the government’ ”&para;<br>or “ ‘to the orders of the President.’ ” 295 U.

And here there is&para;<br>judicial review of any effort to remove Board members, see&para;<br>15 U. S. C. §78y(a)(1), so the Commission will not have the&para;<br>final word on the propriety of its own removal orders. The&para;<br>removal restrictions set forth in the statute mean what&para;<br>they say.&para;<br>Indeed, this case presents an even more serious threat&para;<br>to executive control than an “ordinary” dual for-cause&para;<br>standard. Congress enacted an unusually high standard&para;<br>that must be met before Board members may be removed.&para;<br>A Board member cannot be removed except for willful&para;<br>violations of the Act, Board rules, or the securities laws;&para;<br>willful abuse of authority; or unreasonable failure to en­&para;<br>force compliance—as determined in a formal Commission&para;<br>order, rendered on the record and after notice and an&para;<br>opportunity for a hearing. §7217(d)(3); see §78y(a). The&para;<br>Act does not even give the Commission power to fire Board&para;<br>members for violations of other laws that do not relate to&para;<br>the Act, the securities laws, or the Board’s authority. The&para;<br>President might have less than full confidence in, say, a&para;<br>Board member who cheats on his taxes; but that discovery&para;<br>is not listed among the grounds for removal under&para;<br>§7217(d)(3).7&para;<br>The rigorous standard that must be met before a Board&para;<br>member may be removed was drawn from statutes con­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 The Government implausibly argues that §7217(d)(3) “does not ex­&para;<br>pressly make its three specified grounds of removal exclusive,” and that&para;<br>“the Act could be construed to permit other grounds.” Brief for United&para;<br>States 51, n. 19. But having provided in §7211(e)(6) that Board mem­&para;<br>bers are to be removed “in accordance with [§7217(d)(3)], for good cause&para;<br>shown,” Congress would not have specified the necessary Commission&para;<br>finding in §7217(d)(3)—including formal procedures and detailed&para;<br>conditions—if Board members could also be removed without any&para;<br>finding at all.

While we need not&para;<br>decide the question here, a removal standard appropriate&para;<br>for limiting Government control over private bodies may&para;<br>be inappropriate for officers wielding the executive power&para;<br>of the United States.&para;<br>Alternatively, respondents portray the Act’s limitations&para;<br>on removal as irrelevant, because—as the Court of Ap­&para;<br>peals held—the Commission wields “at-will removal power&para;<br>over Board functions if not Board members.” 537 F. 3d, at&para;<br>683 (emphasis added); accord, Brief for United States 27–&para;<br>28; PCAOB Brief 48. The Commission’s general “oversight&para;<br>and enforcement authority over the Board,” §7217(a), is&para;<br>said to “blun[t] the constitutional impact of for-cause&para;<br>removal,” 537 F. 3d, at 683, and to leave the President no&para;<br>worse off than “if Congress had lodged the Board’s func­&para;<br>tions in the SEC’s own staff,” PCAOB Brief 15.&para;<br>Broad power over Board functions is not equivalent to&para;<br>the power to remove Board members. The Commission&para;<br>may, for example, approve the Board’s budget, §7219(b),&para;<br>issue binding regulations, §§7202(a), 7217(b)(5), relieve&para;<br>the Board of authority, §7217(d)(1), amend Board sanc­&para;<br>tions, §7217(c), or enforce Board rules on its own,&para;<br>§§7202(b)(1), (c). But altering the budget or powers of an&para;<br>agency as a whole is a problematic way to control an infe­&para;<br>rior officer. The Commission cannot wield a free hand to&para;<br>supervise individual members if it must destroy the Board&para;<br>in order to fix it.&para;<br>Even if Commission power over Board activities could&para;<br>substitute for authority over its members, we would still&para;<br>reject respondents’ premise that the Commission’s power&para;<br>in this regard is plenary. As described above, the Board is&para;<br>empowered to take significant enforcement actions, and&para;<br>does so largely independently of the Commission. See&para;<br>supra, at 3–4.

Military officers are broadly subject to Presi­&para;<br>dential control through the chain of command and through&para;<br>the President’s powers as Commander in Chief. Art.

The President&para;<br>and his subordinates may also convene boards of inquiry&para;<br>or courts-martial to hear claims of misconduct or poor&para;<br>performance by those officers. See, e.g., §§822(a)(1),&para;<br>823(a)(1), 892(3), 933–934, 1181–1185. Here, by contrast,&para;<br>the President has no authority to initiate a Board mem­&para;<br>ber’s removal for cause.&para;<br>There is no reason for us to address whether these&para;<br>positions identified by the dissent, or any others not at&para;<br>issue in this case, are so structured as to infringe the&para;<br>President’s constitutional authority.

The only&para;<br>issue in this case is whether Congress may deprive the&para;<br>President of adequate control over the Board, which is the&para;<br>regulator of first resort and the primary law enforcement&para;<br>authority for a vital sector of our economy. We hold that it&para;<br>cannot.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Petitioners’ complaint argued that the Board’s “freedom&para;<br>from Presidential oversight and control” rendered it “and&para;<br>all power and authority exercised by it” in violation of the&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

We reject such a broad holding.&para;<br>Instead, we agree with the Government that the unconsti­&para;<br>tutional tenure provisions are severable from the remain­&para;<br>der of the statute.&para;<br>“Generally speaking, when confronting a constitutional&para;<br>flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the prob­&para;<br>lem,” severing any “problematic portions while leaving the&para;<br>remainder intact.”&para;<br>Ayotte v.

Corporation&para;<br>Comm’n of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234 (1932), the “normal&para;<br>rule” is “that partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the&para;<br>required course,” Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472&para;<br>U. S. 491, 504 (1985). Putting to one side petitioners’&para;<br>Appointments Clause challenges (addressed below), the&para;<br>existence of the Board does not violate the separation of&para;<br>powers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed&para;<br>by §§7211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do. Under the traditional&para;<br>default rule, removal is incident to the power of appoint­&para;<br>ment. See, e.g., Sampson v. Murray, 415 U. S. 61, 70,&para;<br>n. 17 (1974); Myers, 272 U. S., at 119; Ex parte Hennen, 13&para;<br>Pet., at 259–260. Concluding that the removal restrictions&para;<br>are invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission&para;<br>at will, and leaves the President separated from Board&para;<br>members by only a single level of good-cause tenure. The&para;<br>Commission is then fully responsible for the Board’s ac­&para;<br>tions, which are no less subject than the Commission’s&para;<br>own functions to Presidential oversight.&para;<br>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act remains “ ‘fully operative as a&para;<br>law’ ” with these tenure restrictions excised.

Though this inquiry can some­&para;<br>times be “elusive,” Chadha, 462 U.

S., at 684, and nothing in the statute’s text or historical&para;<br>context makes it “evident” that Congress, faced with the&para;<br>limitations imposed by the Constitution, would have pre­&para;<br>ferred no Board at all to a Board whose members are&para;<br>removable at will. Ibid.; see also Ayotte, supra, at 330.&para;<br>It is true that the language providing for good-cause&para;<br>removal is only one of a number of statutory provisions&para;<br>that, working together, produce a constitutional violation.&para;<br>In theory, perhaps, the Court might blue-pencil a suffi­&para;<br>cient number of the Board’s responsibilities so that its&para;<br>members would no longer be “Officers of the United&para;<br>States.” Or we could restrict the Board’s enforcement&para;<br>powers, so that it would be a purely recommendatory&para;<br>panel. Or the Board members could in future be made&para;<br>removable by the President, for good cause or at will. But&para;<br>such editorial freedom—far more extensive than our hold­&para;<br>ing today—belongs to the Legislature, not the Judiciary.&para;<br>Congress of course remains free to pursue any of these&para;<br>options going forward.&para;<br>V&para;<br>Petitioners raise three more challenges to the Board&para;<br>under the Appointments Clause. None has merit.&para;<br>First, petitioners argue that Board members are princi­&para;<br>pal officers requiring Presidential appointment with the&para;<br>Senate’s advice and consent. We held in Edmond v.&para;<br>United States, 520 U. S. 651, 662–663 (1997), that&para;<br>“[w]hether one is an ‘inferior’ officer depends on whether&para;<br>he has a superior,” and that “ ‘inferior officers’ are officers&para;<br>whose work is directed and supervised at some level” by&para;<br>other officers appointed by the President with the Senate’s&para;<br>&para;<br>30&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>consent. In particular, we noted that “[t]he power to&para;<br>remove officers” at will and without cause “is a powerful&para;<br>tool for control” of an inferior. Id., at 664. As explained&para;<br>above, the statutory restrictions on the Commission’s&para;<br>power to remove Board members are unconstitutional and&para;<br>void. Given that the Commission is properly viewed,&para;<br>under the Constitution, as possessing the power to remove&para;<br>Board members at will, and given the Commission’s other&para;<br>oversight authority, we have no hesitation in concluding&para;<br>that under Edmond the Board members are inferior offi­&para;<br>cers whose appointment Congress may permissibly vest in&para;<br>a “Hea[d] of Departmen[t].”&para;<br>But, petitioners argue, the Commission is not a “De­&para;<br>partmen[t]” like the “Executive departments” (e.g., State,&para;<br>Treasury, Defense) listed in 5 U. S. C. §101. In Freytag,&para;<br>501 U. S., at 887, n. 4, we specifically reserved the ques­&para;<br>tion whether a “principal agenc[y], such as . . . the Securi­&para;<br>ties and Exchange Commission,” is a “Departmen[t]”&para;<br>under the Appointments Clause. Four Justices, however,&para;<br>would have concluded that the Commission is indeed such&para;<br>a “Departmen[t],” see id., at 918 (SCALIA, J., concurring in&para;<br>part and concurring in judgment), because it is a “free­&para;<br>standing, self-contained entity in the Executive Branch,”&para;<br>id., at 915.&para;<br>Respondents urge us to adopt this reasoning as to those&para;<br>entities not addressed by our opinion in Freytag, see Brief&para;<br>for United States 37–39; PCAOB Brief 30–33, and we do.&para;<br>Respondents’ reading of the Appointments Clause is con­&para;<br>sistent with the common, near-contemporary definition of&para;<br>a “department” as a “separate allotment or part of busi­&para;<br>ness; a distinct province, in which a class of duties are&para;<br>allotted to a particular person.” 1 N. Webster, American&para;<br>Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (def. 2) (1995&para;<br>facsimile ed.). It is also consistent with the early practice&para;<br>of Congress, which in 1792 authorized the Postmaster&para;<br>General to appoint “an assistant, and deputy postmasters,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>31&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>at all places where such shall be found necessary,” §3, 1&para;<br>Stat. 234—thus treating him as the “Hea[d] of [a] De­&para;<br>partmen[t]” without the title of Secretary or any role in&para;<br>the President’s Cabinet. And it is consistent with our&para;<br>prior cases, which have never invalidated an appointment&para;<br>made by the head of such an establishment. See Freytag,&para;<br>supra, at 917; cf. Burnap v. United States, 252 U. S. 512,&para;<br>515 (1920); United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508, 511&para;<br>(1879). Because the Commission is a freestanding compo­&para;<br>nent of the Executive Branch, not subordinate to or con­&para;<br>tained within any other such component, it constitutes a&para;<br>“Departmen[t]” for the purposes of the Appointments&para;<br>Clause.11&para;<br>But petitioners are not done yet. They argue that the&para;<br>full Commission cannot constitutionally appoint Board&para;<br>members, because only the Chairman of the Commission&para;<br>is the Commission’s “Hea[d].”12 The Commission’s powers,&para;<br>however, are generally vested in the Commissioners&para;<br>jointly, not the Chairman alone. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§77s, 77t, 78u, 78w. The Commissioners do not report to&para;<br>the Chairman, who exercises administrative and executive&para;<br>functions subject to the full Commission’s policies. See&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 We express no view on whether the Commission is thus an “execu­&para;<br>tive Departmen[t]” under the Opinions Clause, Art. II, §2, cl. 1, or&para;<br>under Section 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. See Freytag v.&para;<br>Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 886–887 (1991).&para;<br>12 The Board argued below that petitioners lack standing to raise this&para;<br>claim, because no member of the Board has been appointed over the&para;<br>Chairman’s objection, and so petitioners’ injuries are not fairly trace­&para;<br>able to an invalid appointment. See Defendants’ Memorandum of&para;<br>Points and Authorities in Support of Motion to Dismiss the Complaint&para;<br>in Civil Action No. 1:06–cv–00217–JR (DC), Doc. 17, pp. 42–43; Brief&para;<br>for Appellees PCAOB et al. in No. 07–5127 (CADC), pp. 32–33. We&para;<br>cannot assume, however, that the Chairman would have made the&para;<br>same appointments acting alone; and petitioners’ standing does not&para;<br>require precise proof of what the Board’s policies might have been in&para;<br>that counterfactual world.

The&para;<br>Chairman is also appointed from among the Commission­&para;<br>ers by the President alone, id., §3, at 1266, which means&para;<br>that he cannot be regarded as “the head of an agency” for&para;<br>purposes of the Reorganization Act.

The Appointments Clause neces­&para;<br>sarily contemplates collective appointments by the “Courts&para;<br>of Law,” Art. II, §2, cl. 2, and each House of Congress, too,&para;<br>appoints its officers collectively, see Art. I, §2, cl. 5; id., §3,&para;<br>cl. 5. Petitioners argue that the Framers vested the nomi­&para;<br>nation of principal officers in the President to avoid the&para;<br>perceived evils of collective appointments, but they reveal&para;<br>no similar concern with respect to inferior officers, whose&para;<br>appointments may be vested elsewhere, including in mul­&para;<br>timember bodies. Practice has also sanctioned the ap­&para;<br>pointment of inferior officers by multimember agencies.&para;<br>See Freytag, supra, at 918 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part&para;<br>and concurring in judgment); see also Classification Act of&para;<br>1923, ch. 265, §2, 42 Stat. 1488 (defining “the head of the&para;<br>department” to mean “the officer or group of officers . . .&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 Petitioners&para;<br>&para;<br>contend that finding the Commission to be the head will&para;<br>invalidate numerous appointments made directly by the Chairman,&para;<br>such as those of the “heads of major [SEC] administrative units.”&para;<br>Reorg.

On the one hand,&para;<br>Congress has broad power to enact statutes “necessary&para;<br>and proper” to the exercise of its specifically enumerated&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>constitutional authority. Art. I, §8, cl. 18. As Chief Jus&para;<br>tice Marshall wrote for the Court nearly 200 years ago, the&para;<br>Necessary and Proper Clause reflects the Framers’ efforts&para;<br>to create a Constitution that would “endure for ages to&para;<br>come.” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819).&para;<br>It embodies their recognition that it would be “unwise” to&para;<br>prescribe “the means by which government should, in all&para;<br>future time, execute its powers.” Ibid. Such “immutable&para;<br>rules” would deprive the Government of the needed flexi&para;<br>bility to respond to future “exigencies which, if foreseen at&para;<br>all, must have been seen dimly.” Ibid. Thus the Neces&para;<br>sary and Proper Clause affords Congress broad authority&para;<br>to “create” governmental “ ‘offices’ ” and to structure those&para;<br>offices “as it chooses.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 138&para;<br>(1976) (per curiam); cf. Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 355&para;<br>(1903). And Congress has drawn on that power over the&para;<br>past century to create numerous federal agencies in re&para;<br>sponse to “various crises of human affairs” as they have&para;<br>arisen. McCulloch, supra, at 415 (emphasis deleted). Cf.&para;<br>Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, 36–37 (1950).&para;<br>On the other hand, the opening sections of Articles I, II,&para;<br>and III of the Constitution separately and respectively&para;<br>vest “all legislative Powers” in Congress, the “executive&para;<br>Power” in the President, and the “judicial Power” in the&para;<br>Supreme Court (and such “inferior Courts as Congress&para;<br>may from time to time ordain and establish”). In doing so,&para;<br>these provisions imply a structural separation-of-powers&para;<br>principle. See, e.g., Miller v. French, 530 U. S. 327, 341–&para;<br>342 (2000). And that principle, along with the instruction&para;<br>in Article II, §3 that the President “shall take Care that&para;<br>the Laws be faithfully executed,” limits Congress’ power to&para;<br>structure the Federal Government. See, e.g., INS v.&para;<br>Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 946 (1983); Freytag v. Commis&para;<br>sioner, 501 U. S. 868, 878 (1991); Northern Pipeline&para;<br>Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.

Indeed, this Court has held&para;<br>that the separation-of-powers principle guarantees the&para;<br>President the authority to dismiss certain Executive&para;<br>Branch officials at will. Myers v. United States, 272 U. S.&para;<br>52 (1926).&para;<br>But neither of these two principles is absolute in its&para;<br>application to removal cases. The Necessary and Proper&para;<br>Clause does not grant Congress power to free all Execu&para;<br>tive Branch officials from dismissal at the will of the&para;<br>President. Ibid. Nor does the separation-of-powers prin&para;<br>ciple grant the President an absolute authority to remove&para;<br>any and all Executive Branch officials at will. Rather,&para;<br>depending on, say, the nature of the office, its function, or&para;<br>its subject matter, Congress sometimes may, consistent&para;<br>with the Constitution, limit the President’s authority to&para;<br>remove an officer from his post. See Humphrey’s Executor&para;<br>v. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), overruling in part&para;<br>Myers, supra; Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988).&para;<br>And we must here decide whether the circumstances&para;<br>surrounding the statute at issue justify such a limitation.&para;<br>In answering the question presented, we cannot look to&para;<br>more specific constitutional text, such as the text of the&para;<br>Appointments Clause or the Presentment Clause, upon&para;<br>which the Court has relied in other separation-of-powers&para;<br>cases. See, e.g., Chadha, supra, at 946; Buckley, supra, at&para;<br>124–125. That is because, with the exception of the gen&para;<br>eral “vesting” and “take care” language, the Constitution&para;<br>is completely “silent with respect to the power of removal&para;<br>from office.” Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 258 (1839); see&para;<br>also Morrison, supra, at 723 (SCALIA, J., dissenting)&para;<br>(“There is, of course, no provision in the Constitution&para;<br>stating who may remove executive officers . . . ”).&para;<br>Nor does history offer significant help.

See, e.g., Lessig, Readings By&para;<br>Our Unitary Executive, 15 Cardozo L.

But those statutes&para;<br>did not directly limit the President’s authority to remove&para;<br>any of those officials—“a subject” that was “much dis&para;<br>puted” during “the early history of this government,” “and&para;<br>upon which a great diversity of opinion was entertained.”&para;<br>Hennen, supra, at 259; see also United States ex rel.

Scholars, like Members of this Court, have contin&para;<br>ued to disagree, not only about the inferences that should&para;<br>be drawn from the inconclusive historical record, but also&para;<br>about the nature of the original disagreement. Compare&para;<br>ante, at 11; Myers, supra, at 114 (majority opinion of Taft,&para;<br>C. J.); and Prakash, New Light on the Decision of 1789, 91&para;<br>Cornell L.

Fisher, President&para;<br>and Congress: Power and Policy 86–89 (1972).&para;<br>Nor does this Court’s precedent fully answer the ques&para;<br>tion presented. At least it does not clearly invalidate the&para;<br>provision in dispute. See Part II–C, infra. In Myers,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>supra, the Court invalidated—for the first and only time—&para;<br>a congressional statute on the ground that it unduly lim&para;<br>ited the President’s authority to remove an Executive&para;<br>Branch official. But soon thereafter the Court expressly&para;<br>disapproved most of Myers’ broad reasoning. See Hum&para;<br>phrey’s Executor, 295 U. S., at 626–627, overruling in part&para;<br>Myers, supra; Wiener v. United States, 357 U. S. 349, 352&para;<br>(1958) (stating that Humphrey’s Executor “explicitly ‘dis&para;<br>approved’ ” of much of the reasoning in Myers). Moreover,&para;<br>the Court has since said that “the essence of the decision&para;<br>in Myers was the judgment that the Constitution prevents&para;<br>Congress from ‘draw[ing] to itself . . . the power to remove&para;<br>or the right to participate in the exercise of that power.’ ”&para;<br>Morrison, supra, at 686 (emphasis added). And that fea&para;<br>ture of the statute—a feature that would aggrandize the&para;<br>power of Congress—is not present here. Congress has not&para;<br>granted itself any role in removing the members of the&para;<br>Accounting Board. Cf. Freytag, 501 U. S., at 878 (“separa&para;<br>tion-of-powers jurisprudence generally focuses on the&para;<br>danger of one branch’s aggrandizing its power at the&para;<br>expense of another branch” (emphasis added)); Buckley,&para;<br>424 U. S., at 129 (same); Schor, 478 U. S., at 856 (same);&para;<br>Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 727 (1986) (same). Com&para;<br>pare Myers, supra, (striking down statute where Congress&para;<br>granted itself removal authority over Executive Branch&para;<br>official), with Humphrey’s Executor, supra, (upholding&para;<br>statute where such aggrandizing was absent); Wiener,&para;<br>supra (same); Morrison, supra (same).&para;<br>In short, the question presented lies at the intersection&para;<br>of two sets of conflicting, broadly framed constitutional&para;<br>principles. And no text, no history, perhaps no precedent&para;<br>provides any clear answer. Cf. Chicago v. Morales, 527&para;<br>U. S. 41, 106 (1999) (THOMAS, J., joined by Rehnquist,&para;<br>C. J., and SCALIA, J., dissenting) (expressing the view that&para;<br>“this Court” is “most vulnerable” when “it deals with&para;<br>judge-made constitutional law” that lacks “roots in the&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>language” of the Constitution (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted)).&para;<br>B&para;<br>When previously deciding this kind of nontextual ques&para;<br>tion, the Court has emphasized the importance of examin&para;<br>ing how a particular provision, taken in context, is likely&para;<br>to function. Thus, in Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 53&para;<br>(1932), a foundational separation-of-powers case, the&para;<br>Court said that “regard must be had, as in other cases&para;<br>where constitutional limits are invoked, not to mere mat&para;<br>ters of form, but to the substance of what is required.”&para;<br>The Court repeated this injunction in Schor and again in&para;<br>Morrison. See Schor, supra, at 854 (stating that the Court&para;<br>must look “ ‘beyond form to the substance of what’ Con&para;<br>gress has done”); Morrison, 487 U. S., at 689–690 (“The&para;<br>analysis contained in our removal cases is designed not to&para;<br>define rigid categories of those officials who may or may&para;<br>not be removed at will by the President,” but rather asks&para;<br>whether, given the “functions of the officials in question,”&para;<br>a removal provision “interfere[s] with the President’s&para;<br>exercise of the ‘executive power’ ” (emphasis added)). The&para;<br>Court has thereby written into law Justice Jackson’s wise&para;<br>perception that “the Constitution . . . contemplates that&para;<br>practice will integrate the dispersed powers into a worka&para;<br>ble government.” Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer,&para;<br>343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (opinion concurring in judgment)&para;<br>(emphasis added). See also ibid. (“The actual art of gov&para;<br>erning under our Constitution does not and cannot con&para;<br>form to judicial definitions of the power of any of its&para;<br>branches based on isolated clauses or even single Articles&para;<br>torn from context”).&para;<br>It is not surprising that the Court in these circum&para;<br>stances has looked to function and context, and not to&para;<br>bright-line rules. For one thing, that approach embodies&para;<br>the intent of the Framers. As Chief Justice Marshall long&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ago observed, our Constitution is fashioned so as to allow&para;<br>the three coordinate branches, including this Court, to&para;<br>exercise practical judgment in response to changing condi&para;<br>tions and “exigencies,” which at the time of the founding&para;<br>could be seen only “dimly,” and perhaps not at all.&para;<br>McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415.&para;<br>For another, a functional approach permits Congress&para;<br>and the President the flexibility needed to adapt statutory&para;<br>law to changing circumstances. That is why the “powers&para;<br>conferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitu&para;<br>tion were phrased in language broad enough to allow for&para;<br>the expansion of the Federal Government’s role” over time.&para;<br>New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 157 (1992).&para;<br>Indeed, the Federal Government at the time of the found&para;<br>ing consisted of about 2,000 employees and served a popu&para;<br>lation of about 4 million. See Kaufman, The Growth of the&para;<br>Federal Personnel System, in The Federal Government&para;<br>Service 7, 8 (W. Sayre 2d ed. 1965); Dept. of Commerce,&para;<br>Census Bureau, Historical Statistics of the United States:&para;<br>Colonial Times to 1970, pt. 1, p. 8 (1975). Today, however,&para;<br>the Federal Government employs about 4.4 million work&para;<br>ers who serve a Nation of more than 310 million people&para;<br>living in a society characterized by rapid technological,&para;<br>economic, and social change. See Office of Management&para;<br>and Budget, Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U. S.&para;<br>Government, Fiscal Year 2010, p. 368 (2009).&para;<br>Federal statutes now require or permit Government&para;<br>officials to provide, regulate, or otherwise administer, not&para;<br>only foreign affairs and defense, but also a wide variety of&para;<br>such subjects as taxes, welfare, social security, medicine,&para;<br>pharmaceutical drugs, education, highways, railroads,&para;<br>electricity, natural gas, nuclear power, financial instru&para;<br>ments, banking, medical care, public health and safety,&para;<br>the environment, fair employment practices, consumer&para;<br>protection and much else besides. Those statutes create a&para;<br>host of different organizational structures. Sometimes&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

C. §5221(b)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. II); sometimes they&para;<br>delegate authority to an independent commission or board,&para;<br>e.g., 15 U. S. C. §4404(b); 28 U. S. C. §994; sometimes they&para;<br>place authority directly in the hands of a single senior&para;<br>administrator, e.g., 15 U. S. C. §657d(c)(4); 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§421; sometimes they place it in a sub-cabinet bureau,&para;<br>office, division or other agency, e.g., 18 U. S.

C. §402&para;<br>(2006 ed. and Supp. II); sometimes they vest it in commis&para;<br>sions or advisory committees made up of members of more&para;<br>than one branch, e.g., 20 U. S. C. §42(a); 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§991(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 42 U. S. C. §1975; sometimes&para;<br>they divide it among groups of departments, commissions,&para;<br>bureaus, divisions, and administrators, e.g., 5 U. S. C.&para;<br>§9902(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 7 U. S. C. §136i–1(g); and&para;<br>sometimes they permit state or local governments to&para;<br>participate as well, e.g., 7 U. S. C. §2009aa–1(a). Statutes&para;<br>similarly grant administrators a wide variety of powers—&para;<br>for example, the power to make rules, develop informal&para;<br>practices, investigate, adjudicate, impose sanctions, grant&para;<br>licenses, and provide goods, services, advice, and so forth.&para;<br>See generally 5 U. S. C. §500 et seq.&para;<br>The upshot is that today vast numbers of statutes gov&para;<br>erning vast numbers of subjects, concerned with vast&para;<br>numbers of different problems, provide for, or foresee,&para;<br>their execution or administration through the work of&para;<br>administrators organized within many different kinds of&para;<br>administrative structures, exercising different kinds of&para;<br>administrative authority, to achieve their legislatively&para;<br>mandated objectives. And, given the nature of the Gov&para;<br>ernment’s work, it is not surprising that administrative&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>units come in many different shapes and sizes.&para;<br>The functional approach required by our precedents&para;<br>recognizes this administrative complexity and, more im&para;<br>portantly, recognizes the various ways presidential power&para;<br>operates within this context—and the various ways in&para;<br>which a removal provision might affect that power. As&para;<br>human beings have known ever since Ulysses tied himself&para;<br>to the mast so as safely to hear the Sirens’ song, some&para;<br>times it is necessary to disable oneself in order to achieve&para;<br>a broader objective. Thus, legally enforceable commit&para;<br>ments—such as contracts, statutes that cannot instantly&para;<br>be changed, and, as in the case before us, the establish&para;<br>ment of independent administrative institutions—hold the&para;<br>potential to empower precisely because of their ability to&para;<br>constrain. If the President seeks to regulate through&para;<br>impartial adjudication, then insulation of the adjudicator&para;<br>from removal at will can help him achieve that goal. And&para;<br>to free a technical decisionmaker from the fear of removal&para;<br>without cause can similarly help create legitimacy with&para;<br>respect to that official’s regulatory actions by helping to&para;<br>insulate his technical decisions from nontechnical political&para;<br>pressure.&para;<br>Neither is power always susceptible to the equations of&para;<br>elementary arithmetic. A rule that takes power from a&para;<br>President’s friends and allies may weaken him. But a rule&para;<br>that takes power from the President’s opponents may&para;<br>strengthen him. And what if the rule takes power from a&para;<br>functionally neutral independent authority? In that case,&para;<br>it is difficult to predict how the President’s power is af&para;<br>fected in the abstract.&para;<br>These practical reasons not only support our precedents’&para;<br>determination that cases such as this should examine the&para;<br>specific functions and context at issue; they also indicate&para;<br>that judges should hesitate before second-guessing a “for&para;<br>cause” decision made by the other branches. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Chadha, 462 U. S., at 944 (applying a “presumption that&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>the challenged statute is valid”); Bowsher, 478 U. S., at&para;<br>736 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). Compared to&para;<br>Congress and the President, the Judiciary possesses an&para;<br>inferior understanding of the realities of administration,&para;<br>and the manner in which power, including and most espe&para;<br>cially political power, operates in context.&para;<br>There is no indication that the two comparatively more&para;<br>expert branches were divided in their support for the “for&para;<br>cause” provision at issue here. In this case, the Act em&para;<br>bodying the provision was passed by a vote of 423 to 3 in&para;<br>the House of Representatives and a by vote of 99 to 0 in the&para;<br>Senate. 148 Cong. Rec. 14458, 14505 (2002). The creation&para;<br>of the Accounting Board was discussed at great length in&para;<br>both bodies without anyone finding in its structure any&para;<br>constitutional problem. See id., at 12035–12037, 12112–&para;<br>12132, 12315–12323, 12372–12377, 12488–12508, 12529–&para;<br>12534, 12612–12618, 12673–12680, 12734–12751, 12915–&para;<br>12960, 13347–13354, 14439–14458, 14487–14506. The&para;<br>President signed the Act. And, when he did so, he issued a&para;<br>signing statement that critiqued multiple provisions of the&para;<br>Act but did not express any separation-of-powers concerns.&para;<br>See President’s Statement on Signing the Sarbanes-Oxley&para;<br>Act of 2002, 30 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1286 (2002). Cf.&para;<br>ABA, Report of Task Force on Presidential Signing State&para;<br>ments and the Separation of Powers Doctrine 15 (2006),&para;<br>online at http://www.signingstatementsaba_final_signing_&para;<br>statements_recommendations-report_7-24-06.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 24, 2010, and available in&para;<br>Clerk of Court’s case file) (noting that President Bush&para;<br>asserted “over 500” “constitutional objections” through&para;<br>signing statements “in his first term,” including 82 “related&para;<br>to his theory of the ‘unitary executive’ ”).&para;<br>Thus, here, as in similar cases, we should decide the&para;<br>constitutional question in light of the provision’s practical&para;<br>functioning in context. And our decision should take&para;<br>account of the Judiciary’s comparative lack of institutional&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>expertise.&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>To what extent then is the Act’s “for cause” provision&para;<br>likely, as a practical matter, to limit the President’s exer&para;<br>cise of executive authority? In practical terms no “for&para;<br>cause” provision can, in isolation, define the full measure&para;<br>of executive power. This is because a legislative decision&para;<br>to place ultimate administrative authority in, say, the&para;<br>Secretary of Agriculture rather than the President, the&para;<br>way in which the statute defines the scope of the power&para;<br>the relevant administrator can exercise, the decision as to&para;<br>who controls the agency’s budget requests and funding,&para;<br>the relationships between one agency or department and&para;<br>another, as well as more purely political factors (including&para;<br>Congress’ ability to assert influence) are more likely to&para;<br>affect the President’s power to get something done. That&para;<br>is why President Truman complained that “ ‘the powers of&para;<br>the President amount to’ ” bringing “ ‘people in and try[ing]&para;<br>to persuade them to do what they ought to do without&para;<br>persuasion.’ ” C. Rossiter, The American Presidency 154&para;<br>(2d rev. ed. 1960). And that is why scholars have written&para;<br>that the President “is neither dominant nor powerless” in&para;<br>his relationships with many Government entities,&para;<br>“whether denominated executive or independent.” Strauss,&para;<br>The Place of Agencies in Government: Separation of Pow&para;<br>ers and the Fourth Branch, 84 Colum. L. Rev. 573, 583&para;<br>(1984) (hereinafter Strauss). Those entities “are all sub&para;<br>ject to presidential direction in significant aspects of their&para;<br>functioning, and [are each] able to resist presidential&para;<br>direction in others.” Ibid. (emphasis added).&para;<br>Indeed, notwithstanding the majority’s assertion that&para;<br>the removal authority is “the key” mechanism by which&para;<br>the President oversees inferior officers in the independent&para;<br>agencies, ante, at 20, it appears that no President has ever&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>actually sought to exercise that power by testing the scope&para;<br>of a “for cause” provision. See Bruff, Bringing the Inde&para;<br>pendent Agencies in from the Cold, 62 Vanderbilt L. Rev.&para;<br>En Banc 63, 68 (2009), online at http://vanderbiltlawreview.&para;<br>org/articles/2009/11/Bruff-62-Vand-L-Rev-En-Banc-63.pdf&para;<br>(noting that “Presidents do not test the limits of their&para;<br>power by removing commissioners . . . ”); Lessig &amp; Sun&para;<br>stein 110–112 (noting that courts have not had occasion to&para;<br>define what constitutes “cause” because Presidents rarely&para;<br>test removal provisions).&para;<br>But even if we put all these other matters to the side, we&para;<br>should still conclude that the “for cause” restriction before&para;<br>us will not restrict presidential power significantly. For&para;<br>one thing, the restriction directly limits, not the Presi&para;<br>dent’s power, but the power of an already independent&para;<br>agency. The Court seems to have forgotten that fact when&para;<br>it identifies its central constitutional problem: According&para;<br>to the Court, the President “is powerless to intervene” if he&para;<br>has determined that the Board members’ “conduct merit[s]&para;<br>removal” because “[t]hat decision is vested instead in other&para;<br>tenured officers—the Commissioners—none of whom is&para;<br>subject to the President’s direct control.” Ante, at 14–15.&para;<br>But so long as the President is legitimately foreclosed from&para;<br>removing the Commissioners except for cause (as the&para;<br>majority assumes), nullifying the Commission’s power to&para;<br>remove Board members only for cause will not resolve the&para;<br>problem the Court has identified: The President will still&para;<br>be “powerless to intervene” by removing the Board mem&para;<br>bers if the Commission reasonably decides not to do so.&para;<br>In other words, the Court fails to show why two layers of&para;<br>“for cause” protection—Layer One insulating the Commis&para;<br>sioners from the President, and Layer Two insulating the&para;<br>Board from the Commissioners—impose any more serious&para;<br>limitation upon the President’s powers than one layer.&para;<br>Consider the four scenarios that might arise:&para;<br>1. The President and the Commission both want to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>keep a Board member in office. Neither layer is&para;<br>relevant.&para;<br>2. The President and the Commission both want to&para;<br>dismiss a Board member. Layer Two stops them&para;<br>both from doing so without cause. The President’s&para;<br>ability to remove the Commission (Layer One) is&para;<br>irrelevant, for he and the Commission are in&para;<br>agreement.&para;<br>3. The President wants to dismiss a Board member,&para;<br>but the Commission wants to keep the member.&para;<br>Layer One allows the Commission to make that de&para;<br>termination notwithstanding the President’s con&para;<br>trary view. Layer Two is irrelevant because the&para;<br>Commission does not seek to remove the Board&para;<br>member.&para;<br>4. The President wants to keep a Board member, but&para;<br>the Commission wants to dismiss the Board mem&para;<br>ber. Here, Layer Two helps the President, for it&para;<br>hinders the Commission’s ability to dismiss a Board&para;<br>member whom the President wants to keep in&para;<br>place.&para;<br>Thus, the majority’s decision to eliminate only Layer&para;<br>Two accomplishes virtually nothing. And that is because a&para;<br>removal restriction’s effect upon presidential power de&para;<br>pends not on the presence of a “double-layer” of for-cause&para;<br>removal, as the majority pretends, but rather on the real&para;<br>world nature of the President’s relationship with the&para;<br>Commission. If the President confronts a Commission&para;<br>that seeks to resist his policy preferences—a distinct pos&para;<br>sibility when, as here, a Commission’s membership must&para;<br>reflect both political parties, 15 U. S. C. §78d(a)—the&para;<br>restriction on the Commission’s ability to remove a Board&para;<br>member is either irrelevant (as in scenario 3) or may&para;<br>actually help the President (as in scenario 4). And if the&para;<br>President faces a Commission that seeks to implement his&para;<br>policy preferences, Layer One is irrelevant, for the Presi&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>dent and Commission see eye to eye.&para;<br>In order to avoid this elementary logic, the Court creates&para;<br>two alternative scenarios. In the first, the Commission&para;<br>and the President both want to remove a Board member,&para;<br>but have varying judgments as to whether they have good&para;<br>“cause” to do so—i.e., the President and the Commission&para;<br>both conclude that a Board member should be removed,&para;<br>but disagree as to whether that conclusion (which they&para;<br>have both reached) is reasonable. Ante, at 14–15. In the&para;<br>second, the President wants to remove a Board member&para;<br>and the Commission disagrees; but, notwithstanding its&para;<br>freedom to make reasonable decisions independent of the&para;<br>President (afforded by Layer One), the Commission (while&para;<br>apparently telling the President that it agrees with him&para;<br>and would like to remove the Board member) uses Layer&para;<br>Two as an “excuse” to pursue its actual aims—an excuse&para;<br>which, given Layer One, it does not need. Ante, at 15, n. 4.&para;<br>Both of these circumstances seem unusual. I do not&para;<br>know if they have ever occurred. But I do not deny their&para;<br>logical possibility. I simply doubt their importance. And&para;<br>the fact that, with respect to the President’s power, the&para;<br>double layer of for-cause removal sometimes might help,&para;<br>sometimes might hurt, leads me to conclude that its over&para;<br>all effect is at most indeterminate.&para;<br>But once we leave the realm of hypothetical logic and&para;<br>view the removal provision at issue in the context of the&para;<br>entire Act, its lack of practical effect becomes readily&para;<br>apparent. That is because the statute provides the Com&para;<br>mission with full authority and virtually comprehensive&para;<br>control over all of the Board’s functions. Those who cre&para;<br>ated the Accounting Board modeled it, in terms of struc&para;<br>ture and authority, upon the semiprivate regulatory bod&para;<br>ies prevalent in the area of financial regulation, such as&para;<br>the New York Stock Exchange and other similar self&para;<br>regulating organizations.

And those organizations—&para;<br>which rely on private financing and on officers drawn from&para;<br>the private sector—exercise rulemaking and adjudicatory&para;<br>authority that is pervasively controlled by, and is indeed&para;<br>“entirely derivative” of, the SEC. See National Assn. of&para;<br>Securities Dealers, Inc. v. SEC, 431 F. 3d 803, 806 (CADC&para;<br>2005).&para;<br>Adhering to that model, the statute here gives the Ac&para;<br>counting Board the power to adopt rules and standards&para;<br>“relating to the preparation of audit reports”; to adjudicate&para;<br>disciplinary proceedings involving accounting firms that&para;<br>fail to follow these rules; to impose sanctions; and to en&para;<br>gage in other related activities, such as conducting inspec&para;<br>tions of accounting firms registered as the law requires&para;<br>and investigations to monitor compliance with the rules&para;<br>and related legal obligations. See 15 U. S. C. §§7211–&para;<br>7216. But, at the same time,&para;<br>•	 No Accounting Board rule takes effect unless and&para;<br>until the Commission approves it, §7217(b)(2);&para;<br>•	 The Commission may “abrogat[e], delet[e] or ad[d] to”&para;<br>any rule or any portion of a rule promulgated by the&para;<br>Accounting Board whenever, in the Commission’s&para;<br>view, doing so “further[s] the purposes” of the securi&para;<br>ties and accounting-oversight laws, §7217(b)(5);&para;<br>•	 The Commission may review any sanction the&para;<br>Board imposes and “enhance, modify, cancel, re&para;<br>duce, or require the remission of” that sanction if it&para;<br>find’s the Board’s action not “appropriate,”&para;<br>§§7215(e), 7217(c)(3);&para;<br>•	 The Commission may promulgate rules restricting&para;<br>or directing the Accounting Board’s conduct of all&para;<br>inspections&para;<br>and&para;<br>investigations,&para;<br>§§7211(c)(3),&para;<br>7214(h), 7215(b)(1)–(4);&para;<br>•	 The Commission may itself initiate any investigation&para;<br>or promulgate any rule within the Accounting&para;<br>Board’s purview, §7202, and may also remove any&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

Ante, at 23–24. On the contrary, the&para;<br>Commission’s control over the Board’s investigatory and&para;<br>legal functions is virtually absolute. Moreover, the Com&para;<br>mission has general supervisory powers over the Account&para;<br>ing Board itself: It controls the Board’s budget, §§7219(b),&para;<br>(d)(1); it can assign to the Board any “duties or functions”&para;<br>that it “determines are necessary or appropriate,”&para;<br>§7211(c)(5); it has full “oversight and enforcement author&para;<br>ity over the Board,” §7217(a), including the authority to&para;<br>inspect the Board’s activities whenever it believes it “ap&para;<br>propriate” to do so, §7217(d)(2) (emphasis added). And it&para;<br>can censure the Board or its members, as well as remove&para;<br>the members from office, if the members, for example, fail&para;<br>to enforce the Act, violate any provisions of the Act, or&para;<br>abuse the authority granted to them under the Act,&para;<br>§7217(d)(3).

Everyone concedes that the President’s control over&para;<br>the Commission is constitutionally sufficient. See Hum&para;<br>phrey’s Executor, 295 U. S. 602; Wiener, 357 U.

And if the President’s control over the Com&para;<br>mission is sufficient, and the Commission’s control over&para;<br>the Board is virtually absolute, then, as a practical matter,&para;<br>the President’s control over the Board should prove suffi&para;<br>cient as well.&para;<br>1&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>At the same time, Congress and the President had good&para;<br>reason for enacting the challenged “for cause” provision.&para;<br>First and foremost, the Board adjudicates cases. See 15&para;<br>U. S. C. §7215. This Court has long recognized the appro&para;<br>priateness of using “for cause” provisions to protect the&para;<br>personal independence of those who even only sometimes&para;<br>engage in adjudicatory functions. Humphrey’s Executor,&para;<br>supra, at 623–628; see also Wiener, supra, at 355–356;&para;<br>Morrison, 487 U. S., at 690–691, and n. 30; McAllister v.&para;<br>United States, 141 U.

Indeed, as early as 1789 James Madison&para;<br>stated that “there may be strong reasons why an” execu&para;<br>tive “officer” such as the Comptroller of the United States&para;<br>“should not hold his office at the pleasure of the Executive&para;<br>branch” if one of his “principal dut[ies]” “partakes strongly&para;<br>of the judicial character.” 1 Annals of Congress 611–612;&para;<br>cf. ante, at 19, n. 6 (noting that the statute Congress ulti&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v.

The&para;<br>Court, however, all but ignores the Board’s adjudicatory&para;<br>functions when conducting its analysis. See, e.g., ante, at&para;<br>17–18. And when it finally does address that central&para;<br>function (in a footnote), it simply asserts that the Board&para;<br>does not “perform adjudicative . . . functions,” ante, at 26,&para;<br>n. 10 (emphasis added), an assertion that is inconsistent&para;<br>with the terms of the statute. See §7215(c)(1) (governing&para;<br>“proceeding[s] by the Board to determine whether a regis&para;<br>tered public accounting firm, or an associated person&para;<br>thereof, should be disciplined”).&para;<br>Moreover, in addition to their adjudicative functions, the&para;<br>Accounting Board members supervise, and are themselves,&para;<br>technical professional experts. See §7211(e)(1) (requiring&para;<br>that Board members “have a demonstrated” technical&para;<br>“understanding of the responsibilities” and “obligations of&para;<br>accountants with respect to the preparation and issuance&para;<br>of audit reports”). This Court has recognized that the&para;<br>“difficulties involved in the preparation of” sound auditing&para;<br>reports require the application of “scientific accounting&para;<br>principles.” United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422, 440&para;<br>(1926). And this Court has recognized the constitutional&para;<br>legitimacy of a justification that rests agency independ&para;<br>ence upon the need for technical expertise. See Hum&para;<br>phrey’s Executor, supra, at 624–626; see also Breger &amp;&para;<br>Edles, Established by Practice: The Theory and Operation&para;<br>of Independent Federal Agencies, 52 Admin. L.

Congress delib&para;<br>erately sought to provide that kind of protection. See, e.g.,&para;<br>148 Cong. Rec. 12036, 12115, 13352–13355. It did so for&para;<br>good reason. See ante, at 3 (noting that the Accounting&para;<br>Board was created in response to “a series of celebrated&para;<br>accounting debacles”); H. R. Rep. No. 107–414, pp. 18–19&para;<br>(2002) (same); Brief for Former SEC Chairmen 8–9. And&para;<br>historically, this regulatory subject matter—financial&para;<br>regulation—has been thought to exhibit a particular need&para;<br>for independence. See e.g., 51 Cong. Rec. 8857 (1914)&para;<br>(remarks of Sen. Morgan upon creation of the Federal&para;<br>Trade Commission) (“[I]t is unsafe for an . . . administra&para;<br>tive officer representing a great political party . . . to hold&para;<br>the power of life and death over the great business inter&para;<br>ests of this country. . . . That is . . . why I believe in . . .&para;<br>taking these business matters out of politics”). And Con&para;<br>gress, by, for example, providing the Board with a revenue&para;<br>stream independent of the congressional appropriations&para;<br>process, §7219, helped insulate the Board from congres&para;<br>sional, as well as other, political influences. See, e.g., 148&para;<br>Cong. Rec. 12036 (statement of Sen. Stabenow).&para;<br>In sum, Congress and the President could reasonably&para;<br>have thought it prudent to insulate the adjudicative Board&para;<br>members from fear of purely politically based removal. Cf.&para;<br>Civil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 565&para;<br>(1973) (“[I]t is not only important that the Government&para;<br>and its employees in fact avoid practicing political justice,&para;<br>but it is also critical that they appear to the public to be&para;<br>avoiding it, if confidence in the system of representative&para;<br>Government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent”).&para;<br>And in a world in which we count on the Federal Govern&para;<br>ment to regulate matters as complex as, say, nuclear&para;<br>power production, the Court’s assertion that we should&para;<br>simply learn to get by “without being” regulated “by ex&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>perts” is, at best, unrealistic—at worst, dangerously so.&para;<br>Ante, at 18.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Where a “for cause” provision is so unlikely to restrict&para;<br>presidential power and so likely to further a legitimate&para;<br>institutional need, precedent strongly supports its consti&para;<br>tutionality. First, in considering a related issue in Nixon&para;<br>v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U. S. 425 (1977),&para;<br>the Court made clear that when “determining whether the&para;<br>Act disrupts the proper balance between the coordinate&para;<br>branches, the proper inquiry focuses on the extent to&para;<br>which it prevents the Executive Branch from accomplish&para;<br>ing its constitutionally assigned functions.” Id., at 443.&para;<br>The Court said the same in Morrison, where it upheld a&para;<br>restriction on the President’s removal power. 487 U. S., at&para;<br>691 (“[T]he real question is whether the removal restric&para;<br>tions are of such a nature that they impede the President’s&para;<br>ability to perform his constitutional duty, and the func&para;<br>tions of the officials in question must be analyzed in that&para;<br>light”). Here, the removal restriction may somewhat&para;<br>diminish the Commission’s ability to control the Board,&para;<br>but it will have little, if any, negative effect in respect to&para;<br>the President’s ability to control the Board, let alone to&para;<br>coordinate the Executive Branch. See Part II–A, supra.&para;<br>Indeed, given Morrison, where the Court upheld a restric&para;<br>tion that significantly interfered with the President’s&para;<br>important historic power to control criminal prosecutions,&para;<br>a “ ‘purely executive’ ” function, 487 U. S., at 687–689, the&para;<br>constitutionality of the present restriction would seem to&para;<br>follow a fortiori.&para;<br>Second, as previously pointed out, this Court has re&para;<br>peatedly upheld “for cause” provisions where they restrict&para;<br>the President’s power to remove an officer with adjudica&para;<br>tory responsibilities. Compare Humphrey’s Executor, 295&para;<br>U. S., at 623–628; Wiener, 357 U. S., at 355; Schor, 478&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 854; Morrison, supra, at 691, n. 30, with ante, at&para;<br>17–18 (ignoring these precedents). And we have also&para;<br>upheld such restrictions when they relate to officials with&para;<br>technical responsibilities that warrant a degree of special&para;<br>independence. E.g., Humphrey’s Executor, supra, at 624.&para;<br>The Accounting Board’s functions involve both kinds of&para;<br>responsibility. And, accordingly, the Accounting Board’s&para;<br>adjudicatory responsibilities, the technical nature of its&para;<br>job, the need to attract experts to that job, and the impor&para;<br>tance of demonstrating the nonpolitical nature of the job&para;<br>to the public strongly justify a statute that assures that&para;<br>Board members need not fear for their jobs when compe&para;<br>tently carrying out their tasks, while still maintaining the&para;<br>Commission as the ultimate authority over Board policies&para;<br>and actions. See Part II–B, supra.&para;<br>Third, consider how several cases fit together in a way&para;<br>that logically compels a holding of constitutionality here.&para;<br>In Perkins, 116 U. S., at 483, 484—which was reaffirmed&para;<br>in Myers, 272 U. S., at 127 and in Morrison, supra, at 689,&para;<br>n. 27—the Court upheld a removal restriction limiting the&para;<br>authority of the Secretary of the Navy to remove a “cadet&para;<br>engineer,” whom the Court explicitly defined as an “infe&para;<br>rior officer.” The Court said,&para;<br>“We have no doubt that when Congress, by law,&para;<br>vests the appointment of inferior officers in the heads&para;<br>of Departments it may limit and restrict the power of&para;<br>removal as it deems best for the public interest. The&para;<br>constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the&para;<br>appointment implies authority to limit, restrict, and&para;<br>regulate the removal by such laws as Congress may&para;<br>enact in relation to the officers so appointed.” Per&para;<br>kins, supra, at 485 (emphasis added; internal quota&para;<br>tion marks omitted).&para;<br>See also Morrison, supra, at 723–724 (SCALIA, J., dissent&para;<br>ing) (agreeing that the power to remove an “inferior offi&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>cer” who is appointed by a department head can be re&para;<br>stricted). Cf. ante, at 30–33 (holding that SEC Commis&para;<br>sioners are “Heads of Departments”).&para;<br>In Humphrey’s Executor, the Court held that Congress&para;<br>may constitutionally limit the President’s authority to&para;<br>remove certain principal officers, including heads of de&para;<br>partments. 295 U. S., at 627–629. And the Court has&para;<br>consistently recognized the validity of that holding. See&para;<br>Wiener, supra; United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 706&para;<br>(1974); Buckley, 424 U. S., at 133–136; Chadha, 462 U. S.,&para;<br>at 953, n. 16; Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 725–726; Morrison,&para;<br>supra, at 686–693; Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S.&para;<br>361, 410–411 (1989).&para;<br>And in Freytag, 501 U. S., at 921, JUSTICE SCALIA stated&para;<br>in a concurring opinion written for four Justices, including&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY, that “adjusting the remainder of the&para;<br>Constitution to compensate for Humphrey’s Executor is a&para;<br>fruitless endeavor.” In these Justices’ view, the Court&para;<br>should not create a separate constitutional jurisprudence&para;<br>for the “independent agencies.” That being so, the law&para;<br>should treat their heads as it treats other Executive&para;<br>Branch heads of departments. Consequently, as the Court&para;<br>held in Perkins, Congress may constitutionally “limit and&para;<br>restrict” the Commission’s power to remove those whom&para;<br>they appoint (e.g, the Accounting Board members).&para;<br>Fourth, the Court has said that “[o]ur separation-of&para;<br>powers jurisprudence generally focuses on the danger of&para;<br>one branch’s aggrandizing its power at the expense of&para;<br>another branch.” Freytag, supra, at 878 (emphasis added);&para;<br>accord, Buckley, supra, at 129; Schor, supra, at 856; Mor&para;<br>rison, supra, at 686; cf. Bowsher, supra. Indeed, it has&para;<br>added that “the essence of the decision in Myers,” which is&para;<br>the only one of our cases to have struck down a “for cause”&para;<br>removal restriction, “was the judgment that the Constitu&para;<br>tion prevents Congress from ‘draw[ing] to itself . . . the&para;<br>power to remove.’ ” Morrison, supra, at 686 (quoting&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Myers, supra, at 161; emphasis added). Congress here has&para;<br>“drawn” no power to itself to remove the Board members.&para;<br>It has instead sought to limit its own power, by, for exam&para;<br>ple, providing the Accounting Board with a revenue&para;<br>stream independent of the congressional appropriations&para;<br>process. See supra, at 19; see also Brief for Former SEC&para;<br>Chairmen 16. And this case thereby falls outside the&para;<br>ambit of the Court’s most serious constitutional concern.&para;<br>In sum, the Court’s prior cases impose functional&para;<br>criteria that are readily met here. Once one goes beyond&para;<br>the Court’s elementary arithmetical logic (i.e., “one plus&para;<br>one is greater than one”) our precedent virtually dictates&para;<br>a holding that the challenged “for cause” provision is&para;<br>constitutional.&para;<br>D&para;<br>We should ask one further question. Even if the “for&para;<br>cause” provision before us does not itself significantly&para;<br>interfere with the President’s authority or aggrandize&para;<br>Congress’ power, is it nonetheless necessary to adopt a&para;<br>bright-line rule forbidding the provision lest, through a&para;<br>series of such provisions, each itself upheld as reasonable,&para;<br>Congress might undercut the President’s central constitu&para;<br>tional role? Cf. Strauss 625–626. The answer to this&para;<br>question is that no such need has been shown. Moreover,&para;<br>insofar as the Court seeks to create such a rule, it fails.&para;<br>And in failing it threatens a harm that is far more serious&para;<br>than any imaginable harm this “for cause” provision might&para;<br>bring about.&para;<br>The Court fails to create a bright-line rule because of&para;<br>considerable uncertainty about the scope of its holding—&para;<br>an uncertainty that the Court’s opinion both reflects and&para;<br>generates. The Court suggests, for example, that its rule&para;<br>may not apply where an inferior officer “perform[s] adjudi&para;<br>cative . . . functions.” Cf. ante, at 26, n. 10. But the Ac&para;<br>counting Board performs adjudicative functions.&para;<br>See&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>supra, at 17–18. What, then, are we to make of the&para;<br>Court’s potential exception? And would such an exception&para;<br>apply to an administrative law judge who also has impor&para;<br>tant administrative duties beyond pure adjudication? See,&para;<br>e.g., 8 CFR §1003.9, 34 CFR §81.4 (2009). The Court&para;<br>elsewhere suggests that its rule may be limited to removal&para;<br>statutes that provide for “judicial review of a[n] effort to&para;<br>remove” an official for cause. Ante, at 22; ante, at 25. But&para;<br>we have previously stated that all officers protected by a&para;<br>for-cause removal provision and later subject to termina&para;<br>tion are entitled to “notice and [a] hearing” in the “courts,”&para;<br>as without such review “the appointing power” otherwise&para;<br>“could remove at pleasure or for such cause as [only] it&para;<br>deemed sufficient.” Reagan v. United States, 182 U. S.&para;<br>419, 425 (1901); Shurtleff, 189 U. S., at 314; cf. Hum&para;<br>phrey’s Executor, supra (entertaining civil suit challenging&para;<br>removal). But cf. Bowsher, supra, at 729. What weight,&para;<br>then, should be given to this hint of an exception?&para;<br>The Court further seems to suggest that its holding may&para;<br>not apply to inferior officers who have a different relation&para;<br>ship to their appointing agents than the relationship&para;<br>between the Commission and the Board. See ante, at 22,&para;<br>24–26. But the only characteristic of the “relationship”&para;<br>between the Commission and the Board that the Court&para;<br>apparently deems relevant is that the relationship in&para;<br>cludes two layers of for-cause removal. See, e.g., ante, at&para;<br>23 (“Broad power over Board functions is not equivalent to&para;<br>the power to remove Board members”). Why then would&para;<br>any different relationship that also includes two layers of&para;<br>for-cause removal survive where this one has not? Cf.&para;<br>Part II–A, supra (describing the Commission’s near abso&para;<br>lute control over the Board). In a word, what differences&para;<br>are relevant? If the Court means to state that its holding&para;<br>in fact applies only where Congress has “enacted an un&para;<br>usually high standard” of for-cause removal—and does not&para;<br>otherwise render two layers of “ ‘ordinary’ ” for-cause re&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>moval unconstitutional—I should welcome the statement.&para;<br>Ante, at 22 (emphasis added); see also ante, at 24–25, 15,&para;<br>22, (underscoring this statute’s “sharply circumscribed&para;<br>definition of what constitutes ‘good cause’ ” and its “rigor&para;<br>ous,” “significant and unusual [removal] protections”).&para;<br>But much of the majority’s opinion appears to avoid so&para;<br>narrow a holding in favor of a broad, basically mechanical&para;<br>rule—a rule that, as I have said, is divorced from the&para;<br>context of the case at hand. Compare Parts III–A, III–B,&para;<br>III–C, ante, with Parts II–A, II–B, II–C, supra. And such&para;<br>a mechanical rule cannot be cabined simply by saying&para;<br>that, perhaps, the rule does not apply to instances that, at&para;<br>least at first blush, seem highly similar. A judicial holding&para;<br>by its very nature is not “a restricted railroad ticket, good&para;<br>for” one “day and train only.” Smith v. Allwright, 321&para;<br>U. S. 649, 669 (1944) (Roberts, J., dissenting).&para;<br>The Court begins to reveal the practical problems inher&para;<br>ent in its double for-cause rule when it suggests that its&para;<br>rule may not apply to “the civil service.” Ante, at 26. The&para;<br>“civil service” is defined by statute to include “all appoint&para;<br>ive positions in . . . the Government of the United States,”&para;<br>excluding the military, but including all civil “officer[s]” up&para;<br>to and including those who are subject to Senate confirma&para;<br>tion. 5 U. S. C. §§2101, 2102(a)(1)(B), 2104. The civil&para;<br>service thus includes many officers indistinguishable from&para;<br>the members of both the Commission and the Accounting&para;<br>Board. Indeed, as this Court recognized in Myers, the&para;<br>“competitive service”—the class within the broader civil&para;<br>service that enjoys the most robust career protection—&para;<br>“includes a vast majority of all the civil officers” in the&para;<br>United States. 272 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added); 5&para;<br>U. S. C. §2102(c).&para;<br>But even if I assume that the majority categorically&para;<br>excludes the competitive service from the scope of its new&para;<br>rule, cf. ante, at 26 (leaving this question open), the exclu&para;<br>sion would be insufficient. This is because the Court’s&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“double for-cause” rule applies to appointees who are&para;<br>“inferior officer[s].” Ante, at 2. And who are they? Courts&para;<br>and scholars have struggled for more than a century to&para;<br>define the constitutional term “inferior officers,” without&para;<br>much success. See 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Con&para;<br>stitution §1536, pp. 397–398 (3d ed. 1858) (“[T]here does&para;<br>not seem to have been any exact line drawn, who are and&para;<br>who are not to be deemed inferior officers, in the sense of&para;<br>the constitution”); Edmond v.

Individual Members of the Court&para;<br>would add to the list the Federal Communication Commis&para;<br>sion’s managing director, the Federal Trade Commission’s&para;<br>“secretary,” the general counsel of the Commodity Futures&para;<br>Trading Commission, and more generally, bureau chiefs,&para;<br>general counsels, and administrative law judges, see&para;<br>Freytag, supra, at 918–920 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part&para;<br>and concurring in judgment), as well as “ordinary commis&para;<br>sioned military officers,” Weiss, supra, at 182 (Souter, J.,&para;<br>concurring).&para;<br>Reading the criteria above as stringently as possible, I&para;<br>still see no way to avoid sweeping hundreds, perhaps&para;<br>thousands of high level government officials within the&para;<br>scope of the Court’s holding, putting their job security and&para;<br>their administrative actions and decisions constitutionally&para;<br>at risk. To make even a conservative estimate, one would&para;<br>have to begin by listing federal departments, offices, bu&para;<br>reaus and other agencies whose heads are by statute&para;<br>removable only “for cause.” I have found 48 such agencies,&para;<br>which I have listed in Appendix A, infra. Then it would be&para;<br>necessary to identify the senior officials in those agencies&para;<br>(just below the top) who themselves are removable only&para;<br>“for cause.” I have identified 573 such high-ranking offi&para;<br>cials, whom I have listed in Appendix B, infra. They&para;<br>include most of the leadership of the Nuclear Regulatory&para;<br>Commission (including that agency’s executive director as&para;<br>well as the directors of its Office of Nuclear Reactor Regu&para;<br>lation and Office of Enforcement), virtually all of the&para;<br>leadership of the Social Security Administration, the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

S. C. §§2101a, 3132(a)(2), a group of high&para;<br>ranking officials distinct from the “competitive service,” see&para;<br>§2101(a)(1)(C), who “serve in the key positions just below&para;<br>the top Presidential appointees,” Office of Personnel Man&para;<br>agement, About the Senior Executive Service, online at&para;<br>http://www.opm.gov/ses/about_ses/index.asp; §2102(a)(1)(C),&para;<br>and who are, without exception, subject to “removal” only for&para;<br>cause. §§7542–7543; see also §2302(a)(2) (substantially&para;<br>limiting conditions under which “a career appointee in the&para;<br>Senior Executive Service” may be “transfer[red], or reas&para;<br>sign[ed]”). SES officials include, for example, the Director&para;<br>of the Bureau of Prisons, the Director of the National Drug&para;<br>Intelligence Center, and the Director of the Office of In&para;<br>ternational Monetary Policy in the Treasury Department.&para;<br>See Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Gov&para;<br>ernment Affairs, United States Government Policy and&para;<br>Supporting Positions (2008), pp. 99, 103, 129 (hereinafter&para;<br>Plum Book). And by virtually any definition, essentially&para;<br>all SES officials qualify as “inferior officers,” for their&para;<br>duties, as defined by statute, require them to “direc[t] the&para;<br>work of an organizational unit,” carry out high-level&para;<br>managerial functions, or “otherwise exercis[e] important&para;<br>policy-making, policy-determining, or other executive func&para;<br>tions.” §3132(a)(2) (emphasis added). Cf. ante, at 2 (de&para;<br>scribing an “inferior officer” as someone who “determines&para;<br>the policy and enforces the laws of the United States”);&para;<br>ante, at 26 (acknowledging that career SES appointees in&para;<br>independent agencies may be rendered unconstitutional in&para;<br>future cases). Is the SES exempt from today’s rule or is it&para;<br>&para;<br>30&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>not? The Court, after listing reasons why the SES may be&para;<br>different, simply says that it will not “addres[s]” the mat&para;<br>ter. Ante, at 27. Perhaps it does not do so because it cannot&para;<br>do so without revealing the difficulty of distinguishing the&para;<br>SES from the Accounting Board and thereby also revealing&para;<br>the inherent instability of the legal rule it creates.&para;<br>The potential list of those whom today’s decision affects&para;<br>is yet larger. As JUSTICE SCALIA has observed, adminis&para;<br>trative law judges (ALJs) “are all executive officers.”&para;<br>Freytag, 501 U. S., at 910 (opinion concurring in part and&para;<br>concurring in judgment) (emphasis deleted); see also, e.g.,&para;<br>id., at 881 (majority opinion) (“[A] [tax-court] special trial&para;<br>judge is an ‘inferior Officer’ ”); Edmond, supra, at 654&para;<br>(“[M]ilitary trial and appellate judges are [inferior] offi&para;<br>cers”). But cf. ante, at 26, n. 10. And ALJs are each re&para;<br>movable “only for good cause established and determined&para;<br>by the Merit Systems Protection Board,” 5 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§7521(a)–(b). But the members of the Merit Systems&para;<br>Protection Board are themselves protected from removal&para;<br>by the President absent good cause. §1202(d).&para;<br>My research reflects that the Federal Government relies&para;<br>on 1,584 ALJs to adjudicate administrative matters in&para;<br>over 25 agencies. See Appendix C, infra; see also Memo&para;<br>randum of Juanita Love, Office of Personnel Manage&para;<br>ment, to Supreme Court Library (May 28, 2010) (avail&para;<br>able in Clerk of Court’s case file). These ALJs adjudicate&para;<br>Social Security benefits, employment disputes, and other&para;<br>matters highly important to individuals. Does every&para;<br>losing party before an ALJ now have grounds to appeal on&para;<br>the basis that the decision entered against him is uncon&para;<br>stitutional? Cf. ante, at 26, n. 10 (“[O]ur holding also does&para;<br>not address” this question).&para;<br>And what about the military? Commissioned military&para;<br>officers “are ‘inferior officers.’ ” Weiss, 510 U. S., at 182&para;<br>(Souter, J., concurring); id., at 169–170 (majority opinion).&para;<br>There are over 210,000 active-duty commissioned officers&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>31&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>currently serving in the armed forces. See Dept. of Defense,&para;<br>Active Duty Military Personnel by Rank (Apr. 30, 2010),&para;<br>online at http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/MILITARY/&para;<br>rg1004.pdf. Numerous statutory provisions provide that&para;<br>such officers may not be removed from office except for&para;<br>cause (at least in peacetime). See, e.g., 10 U. S. C. §§629–&para;<br>632, 804, 1161, 1181–1185. And such officers can gener&para;<br>ally be so removed only by other commissioned officers, see&para;<br>§§612, 825, 1187, who themselves enjoy the same career&para;<br>protections.&para;<br>The majority might simply say that the military is&para;<br>different. But it will have to explain how it is different. It&para;<br>is difficult to see why the Constitution would provide a&para;<br>President who is the military’s “commander-in-chief,”&para;<br>Art. II, §2, cl. 1, with less authority to remove “inferior”&para;<br>military “officers” than to remove comparable civil offi&para;<br>cials. See Barron &amp; Lederman, The Commander in Chief&para;<br>at the Lowest Ebb—A Constitutional History, 121 Harv.&para;<br>L. Rev. 941, 1102–1106 (2008) (describing President’s&para;<br>“superintendence prerogative” over the military). Cf. ante,&para;<br>at 26–27 (not “expressing any view whatever” as to&para;<br>whether military officers’ authority is now unconstitutional).&para;<br>The majority sees “no reason . . . to address whether”&para;<br>any of “these positions,” “or any others,” might be deemed&para;<br>unconstitutional under its new rule, preferring instead to&para;<br>leave these matters for a future case. Ante, at 27. But&para;<br>what is to happen in the meantime? Is the work of all&para;<br>these various officials to be put on hold while the courts of&para;<br>appeals determine whether today’s ruling applies to them?&para;<br>Will Congress have to act to remove the “for cause” provi&para;<br>sions? Cf. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 142–143. Can the Presi&para;<br>dent then restore them via executive order? And, still,&para;<br>what about the military? A clearer line would help avoid&para;<br>these practical difficulties.&para;<br>The majority asserts that its opinion will not affect the&para;<br>Government’s ability to function while these many ques&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>tions are litigated in the lower courts because the Court’s&para;<br>holding concerns only “the conditions under which th[e]se&para;<br>officers might some day be removed.” Ante, at 27. But&para;<br>this case was not brought by federal officials challenging&para;<br>their potential removal. It was brought by private indi&para;<br>viduals who were subject to regulation “ ‘here-and-now’ ”&para;<br>and who “object to the” very “existence” of the regulators&para;<br>themselves. Ante, at 33, 8 (emphasis added). And those&para;<br>private individuals have prevailed. Thus, any person&para;<br>similarly regulated by a federal official who is potentially&para;<br>subject to the Court’s amorphous new rule will be able to&para;<br>bring an “implied private right of action directly under the&para;<br>Constitution” “seeking . . . a declaratory judgment that”&para;<br>the official’s actions are “unconstitutional and an injunc&para;<br>tion preventing the” official “from exercising [his] powers.”&para;<br>Ante, at 10, n. 2, 6; cf., e.g., Legal Services Corporation v.&para;<br>Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533, 546 (2001) (affirming grant of&para;<br>preliminary injunction to cure, inter alia, a separation-of&para;<br>powers violation); Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co., 343 U. S.&para;<br>579 (same). Such a plaintiff need not even first exhaust&para;<br>his administrative remedies. Ante, at 7–10.&para;<br>Nor is it clear that courts will always be able to cure&para;<br>such a constitutional defect merely by severing an offend&para;<br>ing removal provision. For a court’s “ability to devise&para;<br>[such] a judicial remedy . . . often depends on how clearly”&para;<br>the “background constitutional rules at issue” have been&para;<br>“articulated”; severance will be unavailable “in a murky&para;<br>constitutional context,” which is precisely the context that&para;<br>the Court’s new rule creates. Ayotte v. Planned Parent&para;<br>hood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 329, 330 (2006).&para;<br>Moreover, “the touchstone” of the severability analysis “is&para;<br>legislative intent,” id., at 330, and Congress has repeat&para;<br>edly expressed its judgment “over the last century that it&para;<br>is in the best interest of the country, indeed essential, that&para;<br>federal service should depend upon meritorious perform&para;<br>ance rather than political service,” Civil Service Comm’n,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>33&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>413 U. S., at 557; see also Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367,&para;<br>380–388 (1983) (describing the history of “Congressional&para;<br>attention to the problem of politically-motivated removals”).&para;<br>And so it may well be that courts called upon to resolve the&para;<br>many questions the majority’s opinion raises will not only&para;<br>apply the Court’s new rule to its logical conclusion, but will&para;<br>also determine that the only available remedy to certain&para;<br>double for-cause problems is to invalidate entire agencies.&para;<br>Thus, notwithstanding the majority’s assertions to the&para;<br>contrary, the potential consequences of today’s holding are&para;<br>worrying. The upshot, I believe, is a legal dilemma. To&para;<br>interpret the Court’s decision as applicable only in a few&para;<br>circumstances will make the rule less harmful but arbitrary. To interpret the rule more broadly will make the&para;<br>rule more rational, but destructive.&para;<br>III&para;<br>One last question: How can the Court simply assume&para;<br>without deciding that the SEC Commissioners themselves&para;<br>are removable only “for cause”? See ante, at 5 (“[W]e&para;<br>decide the case with th[e] understanding” “that the Commissioners cannot themselves be removed by the President except” for cause (emphasis added)). Unless the&para;<br>Commissioners themselves are in fact protected by a “for&para;<br>cause” requirement, the Accounting Board statute, on the&para;<br>Court’s own reasoning, is not constitutionally defective. I&para;<br>am not aware of any other instance in which the Court has&para;<br>similarly (on its own or through stipulation) created a&para;<br>constitutional defect in a statute and then relied on that&para;<br>defect to strike a statute down as unconstitutional. Cf.&para;<br>Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)&para;<br>(opinion for the Court by SCALIA, J.) (slip op., at 20) (“We&para;<br>do not—we cannot—add provisions to a federal statute . . .&para;<br>especially [if] . . . separation-of-powers concerns . . . would&para;<br>[thereby] arise”); The Anaconda v. American Sugar Refining Co., 322 U. S. 42, 46 (1944) (describing parties’ inabil-&para;<br>&para;<br>34&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ity to “stipulate away” what “the legislation declares”).&para;<br>It is certainly not obvious that the SEC Commissioners&para;<br>enjoy “for cause” protection. Unlike the statutes establishing the 48 federal agencies listed in Appendix A, infra, the&para;<br>statute that established the Commission says nothing&para;<br>about removal. It is silent on the question. As far as its&para;<br>text is concerned, the President’s authority to remove the&para;<br>Commissioners is no different from his authority to remove the Secretary of State or the Attorney General. See&para;<br>Shurtleff, 189 U. S., at 315 (“To take away th[e] power of&para;<br>removal . . . would require very clear and explicit language. It should not be held to be taken away by mere&para;<br>inference or implication”); see also Memorandum from&para;<br>David J. Barron, Acting Assistant Attorney General,&para;<br>Office of Legal Counsel, to the Principal Deputy Counsel&para;<br>to the President: Removability of the Federal Coordinator&para;<br>for Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects, p. 2 (Oct.&para;<br>23, 2009), online at http://justice.gov/olc/2009/gas-transportproject.pdf (“[Where] Congress did not explicitly provide&para;<br>tenure protection . . . the President, consistent with . . .&para;<br>settled principles, may remove . . . without cause”); The&para;<br>Constitutional Separation of Powers Between the President and Congress, 20 Op. Legal Counsel 124, 170 (1996)&para;<br>(same).&para;<br>Nor is the absence of a “for cause” provision in the statute that created the Commission likely to have been inadvertent. Congress created the Commission during the 9year period after this Court decided Myers, and thereby&para;<br>cast serious doubt on the constitutionality of all “for cause”&para;<br>removal provisions, but before it decided Humphrey’s&para;<br>Executor, which removed any doubt in respect to the constitutionality of making commissioners of independent&para;<br>agencies removable only for cause. In other words, Congress created the SEC at a time when, under this Court’s&para;<br>precedents, it would have been unconstitutional to make&para;<br>the Commissioners removable only for cause. And, during&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>35&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that 9-year period, Congress created at least three major&para;<br>federal agencies without making any of their officers&para;<br>removable for cause. See 48 Stat. 885, 15 U. S. C. §78d&para;<br>(Securities and Exchange Commission), 48 Stat. 1066, 47&para;<br>U. S. C. §154 (Federal Communications Commission); 46&para;<br>Stat. 797 (Federal Power Commission) (reformed postHumphrey’s Executor as the Federal Energy Regulatory&para;<br>Commission with “for cause” protection, 91 Stat. 582, 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §7171). By way of contrast, only one month after&para;<br>Humphrey’s Executor was decided, Congress returned to&para;<br>its pre-Myers practice of including such provisions in&para;<br>statutes creating independent commissions. See §3, 49&para;<br>Stat. 451, 29 U. S. C. §153 (establishing National Labor&para;<br>Relations Board with an explicit removal limitation).&para;<br>The fact that Congress did not make the SEC Commis&para;<br>sioners removable “for cause” does not mean it intended to&para;<br>create a dependent, rather than an independent agency.&para;<br>Agency independence is a function of several different&para;<br>factors, of which “for cause” protection is only one. Those&para;<br>factors include, inter alia, an agency’s separate (rather&para;<br>than presidentially dependent) budgeting authority, its&para;<br>separate litigating authority, its composition as a multi&para;<br>member bipartisan board, the use of the word “independ&para;<br>ent” in its authorizing statute, and, above all, a political&para;<br>environment, reflecting tradition and function, that would&para;<br>impose a heavy political cost upon any President who tried&para;<br>to remove a commissioner of the agency without cause.&para;<br>See generally Breger &amp; Edles 1135–1155.&para;<br>The absence of a “for cause” provision is thus not fatal to&para;<br>agency independence. Indeed, a “Congressional Research&para;<br>Service official suggests that there are at least 13 ‘inde&para;<br>pendent’ agencies without a removal provision in their&para;<br>statutes.” Id., at 1143, n. 161 (emphasis added) (citing&para;<br>congressional testimony). But it does draw the majority’s&para;<br>rule into further confusion. For not only are we left with&para;<br>out a definition of an “inferior officer,” but we are also left&para;<br>&para;<br>36&para;<br>&para;<br>FREE ENTERPRISE FUND v. PUBLIC COMPANY &para;<br>&para;<br>ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BD. &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>to guess which department heads will be deemed by the&para;<br>majority to be subject to for-cause removal notwithstand&para;<br>ing statutes containing no such provision. If any agency&para;<br>deemed “independent” will be similarly treated, the scope&para;<br>of the majority’s holding is even broader still. See Appen&para;<br>dix D, infra (listing agencies potentially affected).&para;<br>The Court then, by assumption, reads into the statute&para;<br>books a “for cause removal” phrase that does not appear in&para;<br>the relevant statute and which Congress probably did not&para;<br>intend to write. And it does so in order to strike down, not&para;<br>to uphold, another statute. This is not a statutory con&para;<br>struction that seeks to avoid a constitutional question, but&para;<br>its opposite. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.

In doing the latter, it will un&para;<br>dermine the President’s authority.

Cf.&para;<br>supra, at 27 (citing Mouat, 124 U. S., at 307–308; Ger&para;<br>maine, 99 U. S., at 510). The second and third columns&para;<br>respectively list the career appointees in each agency who&para;<br>occupy “general” and “reserved” SES positions. A “gen&para;<br>eral” position is one that could be filled by either a career&para;<br>appointee or by a noncareer appointee were the current&para;<br>(career) occupant to be replaced.&para;<br>See 5&para;<br>U. S. C.&para;<br>§3132(b)(1). Because 90% of all SES positions must be&para;<br>filled by career appointees, §3134(b), “most General posi&para;<br>tions are filled by career appointees,” Plum Book 200. A&para;<br>“reserved” position, by contrast, must always be filled by a&para;<br>career appointee. §3132(b)(1). The data for the “general&para;<br>position” column come from the 2008 Plum Book, a quad&para;<br>rennial manual prepared by the congressional committees&para;<br>responsible for government oversight. See supra, at 29.&para;<br>Positions listed as vacant in that source are not included.&para;<br>The data for the “reserved position” column come from a&para;<br>list periodically published by the Office of Personnel Man&para;<br>agement and last published in 2006. See 72 Fed. Reg.&para;<br>16154–16251 (2007); §3132(b)(4). Given the Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment’s size and the temporal lag between the underly&para;<br>ing sources, the list that follows is intended to be illustra&para;<br>tive, not exact.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.
