Detroit Timber &amp; Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS, WARDEN v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–1470. Argued March 1, 2010—Decided June 1, 2010&para;<br>After advising respondent Thompkins of his rights, in full compliance&para;<br>with Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, Detective Helgert and an&para;<br>other Michigan officer interrogated him about a shooting in which&para;<br>one victim died. At no point did Thompkins say that he wanted to&para;<br>remain silent, that he did not want to talk with the police, or that he&para;<br>wanted an attorney. He was largely silent during the 3-hour interro&para;<br>gation, but near the end, he answered “yes” when asked if he prayed&para;<br>to God to forgive him for the shooting. He moved to suppress his&para;<br>statements, claiming that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right&para;<br>to remain silent, that he had not waived that right, and that his in&para;<br>culpatory statements were involuntary. The trial court denied the&para;<br>motion. At trial on first-degree murder and other charges, the prose&para;<br>cution called Eric Purifoy, who drove the van in which Thompkins&para;<br>and a third accomplice were riding at the time of the shooting, and&para;<br>who had been convicted of firearm offenses but acquitted of murder&para;<br>and assault. Thompkins’ defense was that Purifoy was the shooter.&para;<br>Purifoy testified that he did not see who fired the shots. During clos&para;<br>ing arguments, the prosecution suggested that Purifoy lied about not&para;<br>seeing the shooter and pondered whether Purifoy’s jury had made the&para;<br>right decision. Defense counsel did not ask the court to instruct the&para;<br>jury that it could consider evidence of the outcome of Purifoy’s trial&para;<br>only to assess his credibility, not to establish Thompkins’ guilt. The&para;<br>jury found Thompkins guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison&para;<br>without parole. In denying his motion for a new trial, the trial court&para;<br>rejected as nonprejudicial his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim&para;<br>for failure to request a limiting instruction about the outcome of Puri&para;<br>foy’s trial. On appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected both&para;<br>Thompkins’ Miranda and his ineffective-assistance claims. The Fed&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>eral District Court denied his subsequent habeas request, reasoning&para;<br>that Thompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent and was not&para;<br>coerced into making statements during the interrogation, and that it&para;<br>was not unreasonable, for purposes of the Antiterrorism and Effective&para;<br>Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), see 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1), for&para;<br>the State Court of Appeals to determine that he had waived his right&para;<br>to remain silent. The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the state&para;<br>court was unreasonable in finding an implied waiver of Thompkins’&para;<br>right to remain silent and in rejecting his ineffective-assistance-of&para;<br>counsel claim.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The state court’s decision rejecting Thompkins’ Miranda claim&para;<br>was correct under de novo review and therefore necessarily reason&para;<br>able under AEDPA’s more deferential standard of review. Pp. 7–17.&para;<br>(a) Thompkins’ silence during the interrogation did not invoke&para;<br>his right to remain silent. A suspect’s Miranda right to counsel must&para;<br>be invoked “unambiguously.” Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452,&para;<br>459. If the accused makes an “ambiguous or equivocal” statement or&para;<br>no statement, the police are not required to end the interrogation,&para;<br>ibid., or ask questions to clarify the accused’s intent, id., at 461–462.&para;<br>There is no principled reason to adopt different standards for deter&para;<br>mining when an accused has invoked the Miranda right to remain si&para;<br>lent and the Miranda right to counsel at issue in Davis. Both protect&para;<br>the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination by requiring an&para;<br>interrogation to cease when either right is invoked. The unambigu&para;<br>ous invocation requirement results in an objective inquiry that&para;<br>“avoid[s] difficulties of proof and . . . provide[s] guidance to officers”&para;<br>on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity. Davis, supra, at 458–459.&para;<br>Had Thompkins said that he wanted to remain silent or that he did&para;<br>not want to talk, he would have invoked his right to end the question&para;<br>ing. He did neither. Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(b) Thompkins waived his right to remain silent when he know&para;<br>ingly and voluntarily made a statement to police. A waiver must be&para;<br>“the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation,&para;<br>coercion, or deception” and “made with a full awareness of both the&para;<br>nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the de&para;<br>cision to abandon it.” Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 421. Such a&para;<br>waiver may be “implied” through a “defendant’s silence, coupled with&para;<br>an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating&para;<br>waiver.” North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373. If the State&para;<br>establishes that a Miranda warning was given and that it was un&para;<br>derstood by the accused, an accused’s uncoerced statement estab&para;<br>lishes an implied waiver. The record here shows that Thompkins&para;<br>waived his right to remain silent. First, the lack of any contention&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>that he did not understand his rights indicates that he knew what he&para;<br>gave up when he spoke. See Burbine, supra, at 421. Second, his an&para;<br>swer to the question about God is a “course of conduct indicating&para;<br>waiver” of that right. Butler, supra, at 373. Had he wanted to re&para;<br>main silent, he could have said nothing in response or unambigu&para;<br>ously invoked his Miranda rights, ending the interrogation. That he&para;<br>made a statement nearly three hours after receiving a Miranda&para;<br>warning does not overcome the fact that he engaged in a course of&para;<br>conduct indicating waiver. Third, there is no evidence that his&para;<br>statement was coerced. See Burbine, supra, at 421. He does not&para;<br>claim that police threatened or injured him or that he was fearful.&para;<br>The interrogation took place in a standard-sized room in the middle&para;<br>of the day, and there is no authority for the proposition that a 3-hour&para;<br>interrogation is inherently coercive. Cf. Colorado v. Connelly, 479&para;<br>U. S. 157, 163–164, n. 1. The fact that the question referred to reli&para;<br>gious beliefs also does not render his statement involuntary. Id., at&para;<br>170. Pp. 10–15.&para;<br>(c) Thompkins argues that, even if his answer to Helgert could&para;<br>constitute a waiver of his right to remain silent, the police were not&para;<br>allowed to question him until they first obtained a waiver. However,&para;<br>a rule requiring a waiver at the outset would be inconsistent with&para;<br>Butler’s holding that courts can infer a waiver “from the actions and&para;<br>words of the person interrogated.” 441 U. S., at 373. Any waiver, ex&para;<br>press or implied, may be contradicted by an invocation at any time,&para;<br>terminating further interrogation. When the suspect knows that&para;<br>Miranda rights can be invoked at any time, he or she can reassess his&para;<br>or her immediate and long-term interests as the interrogation pro&para;<br>gresses. After giving a Miranda warning, police may interrogate a&para;<br>suspect who has neither invoked nor waived Miranda rights. Thus,&para;<br>the police were not required to obtain a waiver of Thompkins’&para;<br>Miranda rights before interrogating him. Pp. 15–17.&para;<br>2. Even if his counsel provided ineffective assistance, Thompkins&para;<br>cannot show prejudice under a de novo review of this record. To es&para;<br>tablish ineffective assistance, a defendant “must show both deficient&para;<br>performance and prejudice.” Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___. To establish prejudice, a “defendant must show that there is a&para;<br>reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors,&para;<br>the result of the proceeding would have been different,” Strickland v.&para;<br>Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 694, considering “the totality of the evi&para;<br>dence before the judge or jury,” id., at 695. Here, the Sixth Circuit&para;<br>did not account for the other evidence presented against Thompkins.&para;<br>The state court rejected his claim that he was prejudiced by evidence&para;<br>of Purifoy’s earlier conviction. Even if it used an incorrect legal stan&para;<br>dard, this Court need not determine whether AEDPA’s deferential&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>standard of review applies here, since Thompkins cannot show preju&para;<br>dice under de novo review, a more favorable standard for him. De&para;<br>novo review can be used in this case because a habeas petitioner will&para;<br>not be entitled to relief if his or her claim is rejected on de novo re&para;<br>view. See §2254(a). Assuming that failure to request a limiting in&para;<br>struction here was deficient representation, Thompkins cannot show&para;<br>prejudice, for the record shows that it was not reasonably likely that&para;<br>such an instruction would have made any difference in light of other&para;<br>evidence of guilt. The surviving victim identified Thompkins as the&para;<br>shooter, and the identification was supported by a surveillance cam&para;<br>era photograph. A friend testified that Thompkins confessed to him,&para;<br>and the details of that confession were corroborated by evidence that&para;<br>Thompkins stripped and abandoned the van after the shooting. The&para;<br>jury, moreover, was capable of assessing Purifoy’s credibility, as it&para;<br>was instructed to do. Pp. 17–19.&para;<br>&para;<br>547 F. 3d 572, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

VAN &para;<br>&para;<br>CHESTER THOMPKINS &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[June 1, 2010]&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Cir&para;<br>cuit, in a habeas corpus proceeding challenging a Michi&para;<br>gan conviction for first-degree murder and certain other&para;<br>offenses, ruled that there had been two separate constitu&para;<br>tional errors in the trial that led to the jury’s guilty ver&para;<br>dict. First, the Court of Appeals determined that a state&para;<br>ment by the accused, relied on at trial by the prosecution,&para;<br>had been elicited in violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384&para;<br>U. S. 436 (1966). Second, it found that failure to ask for&para;<br>an instruction relating to testimony from an accomplice&para;<br>was ineffective assistance by defense counsel. See Strick&para;<br>land v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Both of these&para;<br>contentions had been rejected in Michigan courts and in&para;<br>the habeas corpus proceedings before the United States&para;<br>District Court. Certiorari was granted to review the deci&para;<br>sion by the Court of Appeals on both points. The warden&para;<br>of a Michigan correctional facility is the petitioner here,&para;<br>and Van Chester Thompkins, who was convicted, is the&para;<br>respondent.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>On January 10, 2000, a shooting occurred outside a mall&para;<br>in Southfield, Michigan. Among the victims was Samuel&para;<br>Morris, who died from multiple gunshot wounds. The&para;<br>other victim, Frederick France, recovered from his injuries&para;<br>and later testified. Thompkins, who was a suspect, fled.&para;<br>About one year later he was found in Ohio and arrested&para;<br>there.&para;<br>Two Southfield police officers traveled to Ohio to inter&para;<br>rogate Thompkins, then awaiting transfer to Michigan.&para;<br>The interrogation began around 1:30 p.m. and lasted&para;<br>about three hours. The interrogation was conducted in a&para;<br>room that was 8 by 10 feet, and Thompkins sat in a chair&para;<br>that resembled a school desk (it had an arm on it that&para;<br>swings around to provide a surface to write on). App.&para;<br>144a–145a. At the beginning of the interrogation, one of&para;<br>the officers, Detective Helgert, presented Thompkins with&para;<br>a form derived from the Miranda rule. It stated:&para;<br>“NOTIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS&para;<br>AND STATEMENT&para;<br>“1. You have the right to remain silent.&para;<br>“2. Anything you say can and will be used against&para;<br>you in a court of law.&para;<br>“3. You have a right to talk to a lawyer before an&para;<br>swering any questions and you have the right to have&para;<br>a lawyer present with you while you are answering&para;<br>any questions.&para;<br>“4. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be&para;<br>appointed to represent you before any questioning, if&para;<br>you wish one.&para;<br>“5. You have the right to decide at any time before or&para;<br>during questioning to use your right to remain silent&para;<br>and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are be&para;<br>ing questioned.” Brief for Petitioner 60 (some capi&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>talization omitted).&para;<br>Helgert asked Thompkins to read the fifth warning out&para;<br>loud. App. 8a. Thompkins complied. Helgert later said&para;<br>this was to ensure that Thompkins could read, and Hel&para;<br>gert concluded that Thompkins understood English. Id.,&para;<br>at 9a. Helgert then read the other four Miranda warnings&para;<br>out loud and asked Thompkins to sign the form to demon&para;<br>strate that he understood his rights. App. 8a–9a. Thomp&para;<br>kins declined to sign the form. The record contains con&para;<br>flicting evidence about whether Thompkins then verbally&para;<br>confirmed that he understood the rights listed on the form.&para;<br>Compare id., at 9a (at a suppression hearing, Helgert&para;<br>testified that Thompkins verbally confirmed that he un&para;<br>derstood his rights), with id., at 148a (at trial, Helgert&para;<br>stated, “I don’t know that I orally asked him” whether&para;<br>Thompkins understood his rights).&para;<br>Officers began an interrogation. At no point during the&para;<br>interrogation did Thompkins say that he wanted to re&para;<br>main silent, that he did not want to talk with the police, or&para;<br>that he wanted an attorney. Id., at 10a. Thompkins was&para;<br>“[l]argely” silent during the interrogation, which lasted&para;<br>about three hours. Id., at 19a. He did give a few limited&para;<br>verbal responses, however, such as “yeah,” “no,” or “I don’t&para;<br>know.” And on occasion he communicated by nodding his&para;<br>head. Id., at 23a. Thompkins also said that he “didn’t&para;<br>want a peppermint” that was offered to him by the police&para;<br>and that the chair he was “sitting in was hard.” Id., at&para;<br>152a.&para;<br>About 2 hours and 45 minutes into the interrogation,&para;<br>Helgert asked Thompkins, “Do you believe in God?” Id., at&para;<br>11a, 153a. Thompkins made eye contact with Helgert and&para;<br>said “Yes,” as his eyes “well[ed] up with tears.” Id., at 11a.&para;<br>Helgert asked, “Do you pray to God?” Thompkins said&para;<br>“Yes.” Id., at 11a, 153a. Helgert asked, “Do you pray to&para;<br>God to forgive you for shooting that boy down?” Id., at&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>153a. Thompkins answered “Yes” and looked away. Ibid.&para;<br>Thompkins refused to make a written confession, and the&para;<br>interrogation ended about 15 minutes later. Id., at 11a.&para;<br>Thompkins was charged with first-degree murder,&para;<br>assault with intent to commit murder, and certain fire&para;<br>arms-related offenses. He moved to suppress the state&para;<br>ments made during the interrogation. He argued that he&para;<br>had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent,&para;<br>requiring police to end the interrogation at once, see&para;<br>Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U. S. 96, 103 (1975) (citing&para;<br>Miranda, 384 U. S., at 474), that he had not waived his&para;<br>right to remain silent, and that his inculpatory statements&para;<br>were involuntary. The trial court denied the motion.&para;<br>At trial, the prosecution’s theory was that Thompkins&para;<br>shot the victims from the passenger seat of a van driven&para;<br>by Eric Purifoy. Purifoy testified that he had been driving&para;<br>the van and that Thompkins was in the passenger seat&para;<br>while another man, one Myzell Woodward, was in the&para;<br>back. The defense strategy was to pin the blame on Puri&para;<br>foy. Purifoy testified he did not see who fired the weapon&para;<br>because the van was stopped and he was bending over&para;<br>near the floor when shots were fired. Purifoy explained&para;<br>that, just after the shooting, Thompkins, holding a pistol,&para;<br>told Purifoy, “What the hell you doing? Pull off.” Purifoy&para;<br>then drove away from the scene. App. 170a.&para;<br>So that the Thompkins jury could assess Purifoy’s credi&para;<br>bility and knowledge, the prosecution elicited testimony&para;<br>from Purifoy that he had been tried earlier for the shoot&para;<br>ing under an aiding-and-abetting theory. Purifoy and&para;<br>Detective Helgert testified that a jury acquitted him of the&para;<br>murder and assault charges, convicted him of carrying a&para;<br>concealed weapon in a motor vehicle, and hung on two&para;<br>other firearms offenses to which he later pleaded guilty.&para;<br>At Purifoy’s trial, the prosecution had argued that Purifoy&para;<br>was the driver and Thompkins was the shooter. This was&para;<br>consistent with the prosecution’s argument at Thomp&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>kins’s trial.&para;<br>After Purifoy’s trial had ended—but before Thompkins’s&para;<br>trial began—Purifoy sent Thompkins some letters. The&para;<br>letters expressed Purifoy’s disappointment that Thomp&para;<br>kins’s family thought Purifoy was a “snitch” and a “rat.”&para;<br>Id., at 179a–180a. In one letter Purifoy offered to send a&para;<br>copy of his trial transcript to Thompkins as proof that&para;<br>Purifoy did not place the blame on Thompkins for the&para;<br>shooting. Id., at 180a. The letters also contained state&para;<br>ments by Purifoy that claimed they were both innocent.&para;<br>Id., at 178a–179a. At Thompkins’s trial, the prosecution&para;<br>suggested that one of Purifoy’s letters appeared to give&para;<br>Thompkins a trial strategy. It was, the prosecution sug&para;<br>gested, that Woodward shot the victims, allowing Purifoy&para;<br>and Thompkins to say they dropped to the floor when the&para;<br>shooting started. Id., at 187a–189a.&para;<br>During closing arguments, the prosecution suggested&para;<br>that Purifoy lied when he testified that he did not see&para;<br>Thompkins shoot the victims:&para;<br>“Did Eric Purifoy’s Jury make the right decision? I’m&para;<br>not here to judge that. You are not bound by what his&para;<br>Jury found. Take his testimony for what it was, [a]&para;<br>twisted attempt to help not just an acquaintance but&para;<br>his tight buddy.” Id., at 202a.&para;<br>Defense counsel did not object. Defense counsel also did&para;<br>not ask for an instruction informing the jury that it could&para;<br>consider evidence of the outcome of Purifoy’s trial only to&para;<br>assess Purifoy’s credibility, not to establish Thompkins’s&para;<br>guilt.&para;<br>The jury found Thompkins guilty on all counts. He was&para;<br>sentenced to life in prison without parole.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The trial court denied a motion for new trial filed by&para;<br>Thompkins’s appellate counsel. The trial court rejected&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for fail&para;<br>ure to ask for a limiting instruction regarding the outcome&para;<br>of Purifoy’s trial, reasoning that this did not prejudice&para;<br>Thompkins. Id., at 236a.&para;<br>Thompkins appealed this ruling, along with the trial&para;<br>court’s refusal to suppress his pretrial statements under&para;<br>Miranda. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the&para;<br>Miranda claim, ruling that Thompkins had not invoked&para;<br>his right to remain silent and had waived it. It also re&para;<br>jected the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, finding&para;<br>that Thompkins failed to show that evidence of Purifoy’s&para;<br>conviction for firearms offenses resulted in prejudice. App.&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert. 74a–82a. The Michigan Supreme Court&para;<br>denied discretionary review. 471 Mich. 866, 683 N. W. 2d&para;<br>676 (2004) (table).&para;<br>Thompkins filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in&para;<br>the United States District Court for the Eastern District of&para;<br>Michigan.&para;<br>The District Court rejected Thompkins’s&para;<br>Miranda and ineffective-assistance claims. App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 39a–72a. It noted that, under the Antiterrorism&para;<br>and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a fed&para;<br>eral court cannot grant a petition for a writ of habeas&para;<br>corpus unless the state court’s adjudication of the merits&para;<br>was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application&para;<br>of, clearly established Federal law.”&para;<br>28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254(d)(1). The District Court reasoned that Thompkins&para;<br>did not invoke his right to remain silent and was not&para;<br>coerced into making statements during the interrogation.&para;<br>It held further that the Michigan Court of Appeals was not&para;<br>unreasonable in determining that Thompkins had waived&para;<br>his right to remain silent.&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit&para;<br>reversed, ruling for Thompkins on both his Miranda and&para;<br>ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. 547 F. 3d 572&para;<br>(2008). The Court of Appeals ruled that the state court, in&para;<br>rejecting Thompkins’s Miranda claim, unreasonably ap&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>plied clearly established federal law and based its decision&para;<br>on an unreasonable determination of the facts. See 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2254(d). The Court of Appeals acknowledged&para;<br>that a waiver of the right to remain silent need not be&para;<br>express, as it can be “ ‘inferred from the actions and words&para;<br>of the person interrogated.’ ” 547 F. 3d, at 582 (quoting&para;<br>North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373 (1979)). The&para;<br>panel held, nevertheless, that the state court was unrea&para;<br>sonable in finding an implied waiver in the circumstances&para;<br>here. The Court of Appeals found that the state court&para;<br>unreasonably determined the facts because “the evidence&para;<br>demonstrates that Thompkins was silent for two hours&para;<br>and forty-five minutes.” 547 F. 3d, at 586. According to&para;<br>the Court of Appeals, Thompkins’s “persistent silence for&para;<br>nearly three hours in response to questioning and re&para;<br>peated invitations to tell his side of the story offered a&para;<br>clear and unequivocal message to the officers: Thompkins&para;<br>did not wish to waive his rights.” Id., at 588.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals next determined that the state&para;<br>court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law&para;<br>by rejecting Thompkins’s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel&para;<br>claim based on counsel’s failure to ask for a limiting in&para;<br>struction regarding Purifoy’s acquittal. The Court of&para;<br>Appeals asserted that because Thompkins’s central strat&para;<br>egy was to pin the blame on Purifoy, there was a reason&para;<br>able probability that the result of Thompkins’s trial would&para;<br>have been different if there had been a limiting instruction&para;<br>regarding Purifoy’s acquittal.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Under AEDPA, a federal court may not grant a habeas&para;<br>corpus application “with respect to any claim that was&para;<br>adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,” 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2254(d), unless the state court’s decision “was&para;<br>contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>clearly established Federal law, as determined by the&para;<br>Supreme Court of the United States,” §2254(d)(1), or “was&para;<br>based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in&para;<br>light of the evidence presented in the State court proceed&para;<br>ing,” §2254(d)(2). See Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 1). The relevant state-court&para;<br>decision here is the Michigan Court of Appeals’ decision&para;<br>affirming Thompkins’s conviction and rejecting his&para;<br>Miranda and ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on&para;<br>the merits.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Miranda Court formulated a warning that must be&para;<br>given to suspects before they can be subjected to custodial&para;<br>interrogation. The substance of the warning still must be&para;<br>given to suspects today. A suspect in custody must be&para;<br>advised as follows:&para;<br>“He must be warned prior to any questioning that he&para;<br>has the right to remain silent, that anything he says&para;<br>can be used against him in a court of law, that he has&para;<br>the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he&para;<br>cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for&para;<br>him prior to any questioning if he so desires.” 384&para;<br>U. S., at 479.&para;<br>All concede that the warning given in this case was in full&para;<br>compliance with these requirements. The dispute centers&para;<br>on the response—or nonresponse—from the suspect.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Thompkins makes various arguments that his answers&para;<br>to questions from the detectives were inadmissible. He&para;<br>first contends that he “invoke[d] his privilege” to remain&para;<br>silent by not saying anything for a sufficient period of&para;<br>time, so the interrogation should have “cease[d]” before he&para;<br>made his inculpatory statements. Id., at 474; see Mosley,&para;<br>423 U. S., at 103 (police must “ ‘scrupulously hono[r]’ ” this&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“critical safeguard” when the accused invokes his or her&para;<br>“ ‘right to cut off questioning’ ” (quoting Miranda, supra, at&para;<br>474, 479)).&para;<br>This argument is unpersuasive. In the context of invok&para;<br>ing the Miranda right to counsel, the Court in Davis v.&para;<br>United States, 512 U. S. 452, 459 (1994), held that a sus&para;<br>pect must do so “unambiguously.” If an accused makes a&para;<br>statement concerning the right to counsel “that is ambigu&para;<br>ous or equivocal” or makes no statement, the police are not&para;<br>required to end the interrogation, ibid., or ask questions to&para;<br>clarify whether the accused wants to invoke his or her&para;<br>Miranda rights, 512 U. S., at 461–462.&para;<br>The Court has not yet stated whether an invocation of&para;<br>the right to remain silent can be ambiguous or equivocal,&para;<br>but there is no principled reason to adopt different stan&para;<br>dards for determining when an accused has invoked the&para;<br>Miranda right to remain silent and the Miranda right to&para;<br>counsel at issue in Davis. See, e.g., Solem v. Stumes, 465&para;<br>U. S. 638, 648 (1984) (“[M]uch of the logic and language of&para;<br>[Mosley],” which discussed the Miranda right to remain&para;<br>silent, “could be applied to the invocation of the [Miranda&para;<br>right to counsel]”). Both protect the privilege against&para;<br>compulsory self-incrimination, Miranda, supra, at 467–&para;<br>473, by requiring an interrogation to cease when either&para;<br>right is invoked, Mosley, supra, at 103 (citing Miranda,&para;<br>supra, at 474); Fare v. Michael C., 442 U. S. 707, 719&para;<br>(1979).&para;<br>There is good reason to require an accused who wants to&para;<br>invoke his or her right to remain silent to do so unambigu&para;<br>ously. A requirement of an unambiguous invocation of&para;<br>Miranda rights results in an objective inquiry that&para;<br>“avoid[s] difficulties of proof and . . . provide[s] guidance to&para;<br>officers” on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity. Davis,&para;<br>512 U. S., at 458–459. If an ambiguous act, omission, or&para;<br>statement could require police to end the interrogation,&para;<br>police would be required to make difficult decisions about&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>an accused’s unclear intent and face the consequence of&para;<br>suppression “if they guess wrong.” Id., at 461. Suppres&para;<br>sion of a voluntary confession in these circumstances&para;<br>would place a significant burden on society’s interest in&para;<br>prosecuting criminal activity. See id., at 459–461; Moran&para;<br>v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 427 (1986). Treating an am&para;<br>biguous or equivocal act, omission, or statement as an&para;<br>invocation of Miranda rights “might add marginally to&para;<br>Miranda’s goal of dispelling the compulsion inherent in&para;<br>custodial interrogation.” Burbine, 475 U. S., at 425. But&para;<br>“as Miranda holds, full comprehension of the rights to&para;<br>remain silent and request an attorney are sufficient to&para;<br>dispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation&para;<br>process.” Id., at 427; see Davis, supra, at 460.&para;<br>Thompkins did not say that he wanted to remain silent&para;<br>or that he did not want to talk with the police. Had he&para;<br>made either of these simple, unambiguous statements, he&para;<br>would have invoked his “ ‘right to cut off questioning.’ ”&para;<br>Mosley, supra, at 103 (quoting Miranda, supra, at 474).&para;<br>Here he did neither, so he did not invoke his right to re&para;<br>main silent.&para;<br>B&para;<br>We next consider whether Thompkins waived his right&para;<br>to remain silent. Even absent the accused’s invocation of&para;<br>the right to remain silent, the accused’s statement during&para;<br>a custodial interrogation is inadmissible at trial unless the&para;<br>prosecution can establish that the accused “in fact know&para;<br>ingly and voluntarily waived [Miranda] rights” when&para;<br>making the statement. Butler, 441 U. S., at 373. The&para;<br>waiver inquiry “has two distinct dimensions”: waiver must&para;<br>be “voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free&para;<br>and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion,&para;<br>or deception,” and “made with a full awareness of both the&para;<br>nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences&para;<br>of the decision to abandon it.” Burbine, supra, at 421.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Some language in Miranda could be read to indicate&para;<br>that waivers are difficult to establish absent an explicit&para;<br>written waiver or a formal, express oral statement.&para;<br>Miranda said “a valid waiver will not be presumed simply&para;<br>from the silence of the accused after warnings are given or&para;<br>simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventu&para;<br>ally obtained.” 384 U. S., at 475; see id., at 470 (“No effec&para;<br>tive waiver . . . can be recognized unless specifically made&para;<br>after the [Miranda] warnings . . . have been given”). In&para;<br>addition, the Miranda Court stated that “a heavy burden&para;<br>rests on the government to demonstrate that the defen&para;<br>dant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege&para;<br>against self-incrimination and his right to retained or&para;<br>appointed counsel.” Id., at 475.&para;<br>The course of decisions since Miranda, informed by the&para;<br>application of Miranda warnings in the whole course of&para;<br>law enforcement, demonstrates that waivers can be estab&para;<br>lished even absent formal or express statements of waiver&para;<br>that would be expected in, say, a judicial hearing to de&para;<br>termine if a guilty plea has been properly entered. Cf.&para;<br>Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11. The main purpose of Miranda is&para;<br>to ensure that an accused is advised of and understands&para;<br>the right to remain silent and the right to counsel. See&para;<br>Davis, supra, at 460; Burbine, supra, at 427. Thus, “[i]f&para;<br>anything, our subsequent cases have reduced the impact&para;<br>of the Miranda rule on legitimate law enforcement while&para;<br>reaffirming the decision’s core ruling that unwarned&para;<br>statements may not be used as evidence in the prosecu&para;<br>tion’s case in chief.” Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S.&para;<br>428, 443–444 (2000).&para;<br>One of the first cases to decide the meaning and import&para;<br>of Miranda with respect to the question of waiver was&para;<br>North Carolina v. Butler. The Butler Court, after discuss&para;<br>ing some of the problems created by the language in&para;<br>Miranda, established certain important propositions.&para;<br>Butler interpreted the Miranda language concerning the&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“heavy burden” to show waiver, 384 U. S., at 475, in ac&para;<br>cord with usual principles of determining waiver, which&para;<br>can include waiver implied from all the circumstances.&para;<br>See Butler, supra, at 373, 376. And in a later case, the&para;<br>Court stated that this “heavy burden” is not more than the&para;<br>burden to establish waiver by a preponderance of the&para;<br>evidence. Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 168 (1986).&para;<br>The prosecution therefore does not need to show that a&para;<br>waiver of Miranda rights was express. An “implicit&para;<br>waiver” of the “right to remain silent” is sufficient to admit&para;<br>a suspect’s statement into evidence. Butler, supra, at 376.&para;<br>Butler made clear that a waiver of Miranda rights may be&para;<br>implied through “the defendant’s silence, coupled with an&para;<br>understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indi&para;<br>cating waiver.” 441 U. S., at 373. The Court in Butler&para;<br>therefore “retreated” from the “language and tenor of the&para;<br>Miranda opinion,” which “suggested that the Court would&para;<br>require that a waiver . . . be ‘specifically made.’ ” Con&para;<br>necticut v. Barrett, 479 U. S. 523, 531–532 (1987) (Bren&para;<br>nan, J., concurring in judgment).&para;<br>If the State establishes that a Miranda warning was&para;<br>given and the accused made an uncoerced statement, this&para;<br>showing, standing alone, is insufficient to demonstrate “a&para;<br>valid waiver” of Miranda rights. Miranda, supra, at 475.&para;<br>The prosecution must make the additional showing that&para;<br>the accused understood these rights. See Colorado v.&para;<br>Spring, 479 U. S. 564, 573–575 (1987); Barrett, supra, at&para;<br>530; Burbine, supra, at 421–422. Cf. Tague v. Louisiana,&para;<br>444 U. S. 469, 469, 471 (1980) (per curiam) (no evidence&para;<br>that accused understood his Miranda rights); Carnley v.&para;<br>Cochran, 369 U. S. 506, 516 (1962) (government could not&para;<br>show that accused “understandingly” waived his right to&para;<br>counsel in light of “silent record”). Where the prosecution&para;<br>shows that a Miranda warning was given and that it was&para;<br>understood by the accused, an accused’s uncoerced state&para;<br>ment establishes an implied waiver of the right to remain&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>silent.&para;<br>Although Miranda imposes on the police a rule that is&para;<br>both formalistic and practical when it prevents them from&para;<br>interrogating suspects without first providing them with a&para;<br>Miranda warning, see Burbine, 475 U. S., at 427, it does&para;<br>not impose a formalistic waiver procedure that a suspect&para;<br>must follow to relinquish those rights. As a general&para;<br>proposition, the law can presume that an individual who,&para;<br>with a full understanding of his or her rights, acts in a&para;<br>manner inconsistent with their exercise has made a delib&para;<br>erate choice to relinquish the protection those rights af&para;<br>ford. See, e.g., Butler, supra, at 372–376; Connelly, supra,&para;<br>at 169–170 (“There is obviously no reason to require more&para;<br>in the way of a ‘voluntariness’ inquiry in the Miranda&para;<br>waiver context than in the [due process] confession con&para;<br>text”). The Court’s cases have recognized that a waiver of&para;<br>Miranda rights need only meet the standard of Johnson v.&para;<br>Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938). See Butler, supra, at&para;<br>374–375; Miranda, supra, at 475–476 (applying Zerbst&para;<br>standard of intentional relinquishment of a known right).&para;<br>As Butler recognized, 441 U. S., at 375–376, Miranda&para;<br>rights can therefore be waived through means less formal&para;<br>than a typical waiver on the record in a courtroom, cf. Fed.&para;<br>Rule Crim. Proc. 11, given the practical constraints and&para;<br>necessities of interrogation and the fact that Miranda’s&para;<br>main protection lies in advising defendants of their rights,&para;<br>see Davis, 512 U. S., at 460; Burbine, 475 U. S., at 427.&para;<br>The record in this case shows that Thompkins waived&para;<br>his right to remain silent. There is no basis in this case to&para;<br>conclude that he did not understand his rights; and on&para;<br>these facts it follows that he chose not to invoke or rely on&para;<br>those rights when he did speak. First, there is no conten&para;<br>tion that Thompkins did not understand his rights; and&para;<br>from this it follows that he knew what he gave up when he&para;<br>spoke. See id., at 421. There was more than enough&para;<br>evidence in the record to conclude that Thompkins under&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>stood his Miranda rights. Thompkins received a written&para;<br>copy of the Miranda warnings; Detective Helgert deter&para;<br>mined that Thompkins could read and understand Eng&para;<br>lish; and Thompkins was given time to read the warnings.&para;<br>Thompkins, furthermore, read aloud the fifth warning,&para;<br>which stated that “you have the right to decide at any time&para;<br>before or during questioning to use your right to remain&para;<br>silent and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are&para;<br>being questioned.” Brief for Petitioner 60 (capitalization&para;<br>omitted). He was thus aware that his right to remain&para;<br>silent would not dissipate after a certain amount of time&para;<br>and that police would have to honor his right to be silent&para;<br>and his right to counsel during the whole course of inter&para;<br>rogation. Those rights, the warning made clear, could be&para;<br>asserted at any time. Helgert, moreover, read the warn&para;<br>ings aloud.&para;<br>Second, Thompkins’s answer to Detective Helgert’s&para;<br>question about whether Thompkins prayed to God for&para;<br>forgiveness for shooting the victim is a “course of conduct&para;<br>indicating waiver” of the right to remain silent. Butler,&para;<br>supra, at 373. If Thompkins wanted to remain silent, he&para;<br>could have said nothing in response to Helgert’s questions,&para;<br>or he could have unambiguously invoked his Miranda&para;<br>rights and ended the interrogation. The fact that Thomp&para;<br>kins made a statement about three hours after receiving a&para;<br>Miranda warning does not overcome the fact that he&para;<br>engaged in a course of conduct indicating waiver. Police&para;<br>are not required to rewarn suspects from time to time.&para;<br>Thompkins’s answer to Helgert’s question about praying&para;<br>to God for forgiveness for shooting the victim was suffi&para;<br>cient to show a course of conduct indicating waiver. This&para;<br>is confirmed by the fact that before then Thompkins&para;<br>had given sporadic answers to questions throughout the&para;<br>interrogation.&para;<br>Third, there is no evidence that Thompkins’s statement&para;<br>was coerced. See Burbine, supra, at 421. Thompkins does&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>not claim that police threatened or injured him during the&para;<br>interrogation or that he was in any way fearful. The&para;<br>interrogation was conducted in a standard-sized room in&para;<br>the middle of the afternoon. It is true that apparently he&para;<br>was in a straight-backed chair for three hours, but there is&para;<br>no authority for the proposition that an interrogation of&para;<br>this length is inherently coercive. Indeed, even where&para;<br>interrogations of greater duration were held to be im&para;<br>proper, they were accompanied, as this one was not, by&para;<br>other facts indicating coercion, such as an incapacitated&para;<br>and sedated suspect, sleep and food deprivation, and&para;<br>threats. Cf. Connelly, 479 U. S., at 163–164, n. 1. The fact&para;<br>that Helgert’s question referred to Thompkins’s religious&para;<br>beliefs also did not render Thompkins’s statement invol&para;<br>untary. “[T]he Fifth Amendment privilege is not con&para;<br>cerned ‘with moral and psychological pressures to confess&para;<br>emanating from sources other than official coercion.’ ” Id.,&para;<br>at 170 (quoting Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 305&para;<br>(1985)). In these circumstances, Thompkins knowingly&para;<br>and voluntarily made a statement to police, so he waived&para;<br>his right to remain silent.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Thompkins next argues that, even if his answer to&para;<br>Detective Helgert could constitute a waiver of his right to&para;<br>remain silent, the police were not allowed to question him&para;<br>until they obtained a waiver first. Butler forecloses this&para;<br>argument. The Butler Court held that courts can infer a&para;<br>waiver of Miranda rights “from the actions and words of&para;<br>the person interrogated.” 441 U. S., at 373. This principle&para;<br>would be inconsistent with a rule that requires a waiver at&para;<br>the outset. The Butler Court thus rejected the rule pro&para;<br>posed by the Butler dissent, which would have “requir[ed]&para;<br>the police to obtain an express waiver of [Miranda rights]&para;<br>before proceeding with interrogation.” Id., at 379 (Bren&para;<br>nan, J., dissenting). This holding also makes sense given&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that “the primary protection afforded suspects subject[ed]&para;<br>to custodial interrogation is the Miranda warnings them&para;<br>selves.” Davis, 512 U. S., at 460. The Miranda rule and&para;<br>its requirements are met if a suspect receives adequate&para;<br>Miranda warnings, understands them, and has an oppor&para;<br>tunity to invoke the rights before giving any answers or&para;<br>admissions. Any waiver, express or implied, may be con&para;<br>tradicted by an invocation at any time. If the right to&para;<br>counsel or the right to remain silent is invoked at any&para;<br>point during questioning, further interrogation must&para;<br>cease.&para;<br>Interrogation provides the suspect with additional&para;<br>information that can put his or her decision to waive, or&para;<br>not to invoke, into perspective. As questioning commences&para;<br>and then continues, the suspect has the opportunity to&para;<br>consider the choices he or she faces and to make a more&para;<br>informed decision, either to insist on silence or to cooper&para;<br>ate. When the suspect knows that Miranda rights can be&para;<br>invoked at any time, he or she has the opportunity to&para;<br>reassess his or her immediate and long-term interests.&para;<br>Cooperation with the police may result in more favorable&para;<br>treatment for the suspect; the apprehension of accom&para;<br>plices; the prevention of continuing injury and fear; begin&para;<br>ning steps towards relief or solace for the victims; and the&para;<br>beginning of the suspect’s own return to the law and the&para;<br>social order it seeks to protect.&para;<br>In order for an accused’s statement to be admissible at&para;<br>trial, police must have given the accused a Miranda warn&para;<br>ing. See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 471. If that condition is&para;<br>established, the court can proceed to consider whether&para;<br>there has been an express or implied waiver of Miranda&para;<br>rights. Id., at 476. In making its ruling on the admissibil&para;<br>ity of a statement made during custodial questioning, the&para;<br>trial court, of course, considers whether there is evidence&para;<br>to support the conclusion that, from the whole course of&para;<br>questioning, an express or implied waiver has been estab&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>lished. Thus, after giving a Miranda warning, police may&para;<br>interrogate a suspect who has neither invoked nor waived&para;<br>his or her Miranda rights. On these premises, it follows the police were not required to obtain a waiver of&para;<br>Thompkins’s Miranda rights before commencing the&para;<br>interrogation.&para;<br>D&para;<br>In sum, a suspect who has received and understood the&para;<br>Miranda warnings, and has not invoked his Miranda&para;<br>rights, waives the right to remain silent by making an&para;<br>uncoerced statement to the police. Thompkins did not&para;<br>invoke his right to remain silent and stop the questioning.&para;<br>Understanding his rights in full, he waived his right to&para;<br>remain silent by making a voluntary statement to the&para;<br>police. The police, moreover, were not required to obtain a&para;<br>waiver of Thompkins’s right to remain silent before inter&para;<br>rogating him. The state court’s decision rejecting Thomp&para;<br>kins’s Miranda claim was thus correct under de novo&para;<br>review and therefore necessarily reasonable under the&para;<br>more deferential AEDPA standard of review, 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254(d). See Knowles, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11)&para;<br>(state court’s decision was correct under de novo review&para;<br>and not unreasonable under AEDPA).&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The second issue in this case is whether Thompkins’s&para;<br>counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to re&para;<br>quest a limiting instruction regarding how the jury could&para;<br>consider the outcome of Purifoy’s trial. To establish inef&para;<br>fective assistance of counsel, a defendant “must show both&para;<br>deficient performance and prejudice.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 10) (citing Strickland, 466 U. S., at 687). To establish&para;<br>prejudice, a “defendant must show that there is a reason&para;<br>able probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional&para;<br>errors, the result of the proceeding would have been dif&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ferent.” Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. In assessing preju&para;<br>dice, courts “must consider the totality of the evidence&para;<br>before the judge or jury.” Id., at 695. The Court of Ap&para;<br>peals, however, neglected to take into account the other&para;<br>evidence presented against Thompkins.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals determined that the state court&para;<br>was unreasonable, 28 U. S. C. §2254(d), when it found that&para;<br>Thompkins suffered no prejudice from failure of defense&para;<br>counsel to request an instruction regarding Purifoy’s&para;<br>earlier acquittal of the murder and assault charges. The&para;<br>state court had rejected Thompkins’s claim that he was&para;<br>prejudiced by evidence of Purifoy’s earlier conviction for&para;<br>firearms offenses, noting that “the record does not disclose&para;<br>an attempt to argue that conviction for an improper pur&para;<br>pose.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a. It is unclear what preju&para;<br>dice standard the state court applied. The Court of Ap&para;<br>peals ruled that the state court used the incorrect&para;<br>standard for assessing prejudice under Strickland because&para;<br>“[q]uestions of the prosecution’s purpose or intent are&para;<br>completely irrelevant in analyzing whether an error re&para;<br>sulted in prejudice, which by definition concerns the er&para;<br>ror’s effect upon the outcome.” 547 F. 3d, at 591–592&para;<br>(emphasis deleted).&para;<br>Even if the state court used an incorrect legal standard,&para;<br>we need not determine whether AEDPA’s deferential&para;<br>standard of review, 28 U. S. C. §2254(d), applies in this&para;<br>situation. Cf. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 397–398&para;<br>(2000). That is because, even if AEDPA deference does not&para;<br>apply, Thompkins cannot show prejudice under de novo&para;<br>review, the more favorable standard of review for Thomp&para;<br>kins. Courts cannot grant writs of habeas corpus under&para;<br>§2254 by engaging only in de novo review when it is un&para;<br>clear whether AEDPA deference applies, §2254(d). In&para;<br>those situations, courts must resolve whether AEDPA&para;<br>deference applies, because if it does, a habeas petitioner&para;<br>may not be entitled to a writ of habeas corpus under&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§2254(d). Courts can, however, deny writs of habeas&para;<br>corpus under §2254 by engaging in de novo review when it&para;<br>is unclear whether AEDPA deference applies, because a&para;<br>habeas petitioner will not be entitled to a writ of habeas&para;<br>corpus if his or her claim is rejected on de novo review, see&para;<br>§2254(a).&para;<br>It seems doubtful that failure to request the instruction&para;<br>about the earlier acquittal or conviction was deficient&para;<br>representation; but on the assumption that it was, on this&para;<br>record Thompkins cannot show prejudice. The record&para;<br>establishes that it was not reasonably likely that the&para;<br>instruction would have made any difference in light of all&para;<br>the other evidence of guilt. The surviving victim, Freder&para;<br>ick France, identified Thompkins as the shooter, and the&para;<br>identification was supported by a photograph taken from a&para;<br>surveillance camera. Thompkins’s friend Omar Stephens&para;<br>testified that Thompkins confessed to him during a phone&para;<br>conversation, and the details of that confession were cor&para;<br>roborated by evidence that Thompkins stripped the van&para;<br>and abandoned it after the shooting. The jury, moreover,&para;<br>was capable of assessing Purifoy’s credibility, as it was&para;<br>instructed to do. The jury in Thompkins’s case could have&para;<br>concluded that the earlier jury in Purifoy’s case made a&para;<br>mistake, or alternatively, that Purifoy was not in fact&para;<br>guilty of the crime for which he had been charged.

VAN &para;<br>&para;<br>CHESTER THOMPKINS &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[June 1, 2010]&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS,&para;<br>JUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE BREYER join, dissenting.&para;<br>The Court concludes today that a criminal suspect&para;<br>waives his right to remain silent if, after sitting tacit and&para;<br>uncommunicative through nearly three hours of police&para;<br>interrogation, he utters a few one-word responses. The&para;<br>Court also concludes that a suspect who wishes to guard&para;<br>his right to remain silent against such a finding of&para;<br>“waiver” must, counterintuitively, speak—and must do so&para;<br>with sufficient precision to satisfy a clear-statement rule&para;<br>that construes ambiguity in favor of the police. Both&para;<br>propositions mark a substantial retreat from the protec­&para;<br>tion against compelled self-incrimination that Miranda v.&para;<br>Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), has long provided during&para;<br>custodial interrogation. The broad rules the Court an­&para;<br>nounces today are also troubling because they are unnec­&para;<br>essary to decide this case, which is governed by the defer­&para;<br>ential standard of review set forth in the Antiterrorism&para;<br>and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2254(d). Because I believe Thompkins is entitled&para;<br>to relief under AEDPA on the ground that his statements&para;<br>were admitted at trial without the prosecution having&para;<br>carried its burden to show that he waived his right to&para;<br>remain silent; because longstanding principles of judicial&para;<br>restraint counsel leaving for another day the questions of&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>law the Court reaches out to decide; and because the&para;<br>Court’s answers to those questions do not result from a&para;<br>faithful application of our prior decisions, I respectfully&para;<br>dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the&para;<br>Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which held that&para;<br>Thompkins was entitled to habeas relief under both&para;<br>Miranda and Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668&para;<br>(1984). 547 F. 3d 572 (2008). As to the Miranda claims,&para;<br>Thompkins argues first that through his conduct during&para;<br>the 3-hour custodial interrogation he effectively invoked&para;<br>his right to remain silent, requiring police to cut off ques­&para;<br>tioning in accordance with Miranda and Michigan v.&para;<br>Mosley, 423 U. S. 96 (1975). Thompkins also contends his&para;<br>statements were in any case inadmissible because the&para;<br>prosecution failed to meet its heavy burden under&para;<br>Miranda of proving that he knowingly and intelligently&para;<br>waived his right to remain silent. The Sixth Circuit&para;<br>agreed with Thompkins as to waiver and declined to reach&para;<br>the question of invocation. 547 F. 3d, at 583–584, n. 4. In&para;<br>my view, even if Thompkins cannot prevail on his invoca­&para;<br>tion claim under AEDPA, he is entitled to relief as to&para;<br>waiver. Because I would affirm the judgment of the Sixth&para;<br>Circuit on that ground, I would not reach Thompkins’&para;<br>claim that he received constitutionally ineffective assis­&para;<br>tance of counsel.&para;<br>The strength of Thompkins’ Miranda claims depends in&para;<br>large part on the circumstances of the 3-hour interroga­&para;<br>tion, at the end of which he made inculpatory statements&para;<br>later introduced at trial. The Court’s opinion downplays&para;<br>record evidence that Thompkins remained almost com­&para;<br>pletely silent and unresponsive throughout that session.&para;<br>One of the interrogating officers, Detective Helgert, testi­&para;<br>fied that although Thompkins was administered Miranda&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>warnings, the last of which he read aloud, Thompkins&para;<br>expressly declined to sign a written acknowledgment that&para;<br>he had been advised of and understood his rights. There&para;<br>is conflicting evidence in the record about whether&para;<br>Thompkins ever verbally confirmed understanding his&para;<br>rights.1 The record contains no indication that the officers&para;<br>sought or obtained an express waiver.&para;<br>As to the interrogation itself, Helgert candidly charac­&para;<br>terized it as “very, very one-sided” and “nearly a mono­&para;<br>logue.” App. 10a, 17a. Thompkins was “[p]eculiar,”&para;<br>“[s]ullen,” and “[g]enerally quiet.” Id., at 149a. Helgert&para;<br>and his partner “did most of the talking,” as Thompkins&para;<br>was “not verbally communicative” and “[l]argely” re­&para;<br>mained silent. Id., at 149a, 17a, 19a. To the extent&para;<br>Thompkins gave any response, his answers consisted of “a&para;<br>word or two. A ‘yeah,’ or a ‘no,’ or ‘I don’t know.’ . . . And&para;<br>sometimes . . . he simply sat down . . . with [his] head in&para;<br>[his] hands looking down. Sometimes . . . he would look up&para;<br>and make eye-contact would be the only response.” Id., at&para;<br>23a–24a. After proceeding in this fashion for approxi­&para;<br>mately 2 hours and 45 minutes, Helgert asked Thompkins&para;<br>three questions relating to his faith in God. The prosecu­&para;<br>tion relied at trial on Thompkins’ one-word answers of&para;<br>“yes.” See id., at 10a–11a.&para;<br>Thompkins’ nonresponsiveness is particularly striking&para;<br>in the context of the officers’ interview strategy, later&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 At&para;<br>&para;<br>the suppression hearing, Detective Helgert testified that after&para;<br>reading Thompkins the warnings, “I believe I asked him if he under­&para;<br>stood the Rights, and I think I got a verbal answer to that as a ‘yes.’ ”&para;<br>App. 9a. In denying the motion to suppress, the trial court relied on&para;<br>that factual premise. Id., at 26a. In his later testimony at trial, Hel­&para;<br>gert remembered the encounter differently. Asked whether Thompkins&para;<br>“indicate[d] that he understood [the warnings]” after they had been&para;<br>read, Helgert stated “I don’t know that I orally asked him that ques­&para;<br>tion.” Id., at 148a. Nevertheless, the Michigan Court of Appeals stated&para;<br>that Thompkins verbally acknowledged understanding his rights. App.&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert. 75a.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>explained as conveying to Thompkins that “this was his&para;<br>opportunity to explain his side [of the story]” because&para;<br>“[e]verybody else, including [his] co-[d]efendants, had&para;<br>given their version,” and asking him “[w]ho is going to&para;<br>speak up for you if you don’t speak up for yourself?” Id., at&para;<br>10a, 21a. Yet, Helgert confirmed that the “only thing&para;<br>[Thompkins said] relative to his involvement [in the shoot­&para;<br>ing]” occurred near the end of the interview—i.e., in re­&para;<br>sponse to the questions about God. Id., at 10a–11a (em­&para;<br>phasis added). The only other responses Helgert could&para;<br>remember Thompkins giving were that “ ‘[h]e didn’t want&para;<br>a peppermint’ ” and “ ‘the chair that he was sitting in was&para;<br>hard.’ ” Id., at 152a. Nevertheless, the Michigan court&para;<br>concluded on this record that Thompkins had not invoked&para;<br>his right to remain silent because “he continued to talk&para;<br>with the officer, albeit sporadically,” and that he voluntar­&para;<br>ily waived that right. App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a.&para;<br>Thompkins’ federal habeas petition is governed by&para;<br>AEDPA, under which a federal court may not grant the&para;<br>writ unless the state court’s adjudication of the merits of&para;<br>the claim at issue “was contrary to, or involved an unrea­&para;<br>sonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as&para;<br>determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,”&para;<br>or “was based on an unreasonable determination of the&para;<br>facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court&para;<br>proceeding.” §§2254(d)(1), (2).&para;<br>The relevant clearly established federal law for purposes&para;<br>of §2254(d)(1) begins with our landmark Miranda decision,&para;<br>which “g[a]ve force to the Constitution’s protection against&para;<br>compelled self-incrimination” by establishing “ ‘certain&para;<br>procedural safeguards that require police to advise crimi­&para;<br>nal suspects of their rights under the Fifth and Four­&para;<br>teenth Amendments before commencing custodial interro­&para;<br>gation,’ ” Florida v.

S. 458 (1938).” Ibid.&para;<br>The question whether a suspect has validly waived his&para;<br>right is “entirely distinct” as a matter of law from whether&para;<br>he invoked that right. Smith v. Illinois, 469 U. S. 91, 98&para;<br>(1984) (per curiam). The questions are related, however,&para;<br>in terms of the practical effect on the exercise of a sus­&para;<br>pect’s rights. A suspect may at any time revoke his prior&para;<br>waiver of rights—or, closer to the facts of this case, guard&para;<br>against the possibility of a future finding that he implicitly&para;<br>waived his rights—by invoking the rights and thereby&para;<br>requiring the police to cease questioning. Accord, ante, at&para;<br>16.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Like the Sixth Circuit, I begin with the question&para;<br>whether Thompkins waived his right to remain silent.&para;<br>Even if Thompkins did not invoke that right, he is entitled&para;<br>to relief because Michigan did not satisfy its burden of&para;<br>establishing waiver.&para;<br>Miranda’s discussion of the prosecution’s burden in&para;<br>proving waiver speaks with particular clarity to the facts&para;<br>of this case and therefore merits reproducing at length:&para;<br>“If [an] interrogation continues without the pres­&para;<br>ence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy&para;<br>burden rests on the government to demonstrate that&para;<br>the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his&para;<br>privilege against self-incrimination and his right to&para;<br>retained or appointed counsel. . . . Since the State is&para;<br>responsible for establishing the isolated circumstances&para;<br>under which [an] interrogation takes place and has&para;<br>the only means of making available corroborated evi­&para;<br>dence of warnings given during incommunicado inter­&para;<br>rogation, the burden is rightly on its shoulders.&para;<br>“An express statement that the individual is willing&para;<br>to make a statement and does not want an attorney&para;<br>followed closely by a statement could constitute a&para;<br>waiver. But a valid waiver will not be presumed sim­&para;<br>ply from the silence of the accused after warnings are&para;<br>given or simply from the fact that a confession was in&para;<br>fact eventually obtained.” 384 U. S., at 475.&para;<br>Miranda went further in describing the facts likely&para;<br>to satisfy the prosecution’s burden of establishing the ad­&para;<br>missibility of statements obtained after a lengthy&para;<br>interrogation:&para;<br>“Whatever the testimony of the authorities as to&para;<br>waiver of rights by an accused, the fact of lengthy in­&para;<br>terrogation or incommunicado incarceration before a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

In these circum­&para;<br>stances the fact that the individual eventually made a&para;<br>statement is consistent with the conclusion that the&para;<br>compelling influence of the interrogation finally forced&para;<br>him to do so. It is inconsistent with any notion of a&para;<br>voluntary relinquishment of the privilege.” Id., at&para;<br>476.&para;<br>This Court’s decisions subsequent to Miranda have&para;<br>emphasized the prosecution’s “heavy burden” in proving&para;<br>waiver. See, e.g., Tague v. Louisiana, 444 U. S. 469, 470–&para;<br>471 (1980) (per curiam); Fare v. Michael C., 442 U. S. 707,&para;<br>724 (1979). We have also reaffirmed that a court may not&para;<br>presume waiver from a suspect’s silence or from the mere&para;<br>fact that a confession was eventually obtained. See North&para;<br>Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373 (1979).&para;<br>Even in concluding that Miranda does not invariably&para;<br>require an express waiver of the right to silence or the&para;<br>right to counsel, this Court in Butler made clear that the&para;<br>prosecution bears a substantial burden in establishing an&para;<br>implied waiver. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had&para;<br>obtained statements after advising Butler of his rights and&para;<br>confirming that he understood them. When presented&para;<br>with a written waiver-of-rights form, Butler told the&para;<br>agents, “ ‘I will talk to you but I am not signing any form.’ ”&para;<br>441 U. S., at 371. He then made inculpatory statements,&para;<br>which he later sought to suppress on the ground that he&para;<br>had not expressly waived his right to counsel.&para;<br>Although this Court reversed the state-court judgment&para;<br>concluding that the statements were inadmissible, we&para;<br>quoted at length portions of the Miranda opinion repro­&para;<br>duced above. We cautioned that even an “express written&para;<br>or oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or&para;<br>of the right to counsel” is not “inevitably . . . sufficient to&para;<br>establish waiver,” emphasizing that “[t]he question is . . .&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>whether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily&para;<br>waived the rights delineated in the Miranda case.” 441&para;<br>U. S., at 373. Miranda, we observed, “unequivocally said&para;<br>. . . mere silence is not enough.” 441 U. S., at 373. While&para;<br>we stopped short in Butler of announcing a per se rule that&para;<br>“the defendant’s silence, coupled with an understanding of&para;<br>his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver, may&para;<br>never support a conclusion that a defendant has waived&para;<br>his rights,” we reiterated that “courts must presume that a&para;<br>defendant did not waive his rights; the prosecution’s bur­&para;<br>den is great.” Ibid.2&para;<br>Rarely do this Court’s precedents provide clearly estab­&para;<br>lished law so closely on point with the facts of a particular&para;<br>case. Together, Miranda and Butler establish that a court&para;<br>“must presume that a defendant did not waive his&para;<br>right[s]”; the prosecution bears a “heavy burden” in at­&para;<br>tempting to demonstrate waiver; the fact of a “lengthy&para;<br>interrogation” prior to obtaining statements is “strong&para;<br>evidence” against a finding of valid waiver; “mere silence”&para;<br>in response to questioning is “not enough”; and waiver&para;<br>may not be presumed “simply from the fact that a confes­&para;<br>sion was in fact eventually obtained.” Miranda, supra, at&para;<br>475–476; Butler, supra, at 372–373.3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Court cites Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 168 (1986), for&para;<br>the proposition that the prosecution’s “ ‘heavy burden’ ” under Miranda&para;<br>“is not more than the burden to establish waiver by a preponderance of&para;<br>the evidence.” Ante, at 12. Connelly did reject a clear and convincing&para;<br>evidence standard of proof in favor of a preponderance burden. But&para;<br>nothing in Connelly displaced the core presumption against finding a&para;<br>waiver of rights, and we have subsequently relied on Miranda’s charac­&para;<br>terization of the prosecution’s burden as “heavy.” See Arizona v.&para;<br>Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 680 (1988).&para;<br>3 Likely reflecting the great weight of the prosecution’s burden in&para;<br>proving implied waiver, many contemporary police training resources&para;<br>instruct officers to obtain a waiver of rights prior to proceeding at all&para;<br>with an interrogation. See, e.g., F. Inbau, J. Reid, J. Buckley, &amp; B.&para;<br>Jayne, Criminal Interrogation and Confessions 491 (4th ed. 2004)&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

His refusal to sign even&para;<br>an acknowledgment that he understood his Miranda&para;<br>rights evinces, if anything, an intent not to waive those&para;<br>rights. Cf. United States v. Plugh, 576 F. 3d 135, 142&para;<br>(CA2 2009) (suspect’s refusal to sign waiver-of-rights form&para;<br>“constituted an unequivocally negative answer to the&para;<br>question . . . whether he was willing to waive his rights”).&para;<br>That Thompkins did not make the inculpatory statements&para;<br>at issue until after approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes&para;<br>of interrogation serves as “strong evidence” against&para;<br>waiver. Miranda and Butler expressly preclude the possi­&para;<br>bility that the inculpatory statements themselves are&para;<br>sufficient to establish waiver.&para;<br>In these circumstances, Thompkins’ “actions and words”&para;<br>preceding the inculpatory statements simply do not evi­&para;<br>dence a “course of conduct indicating waiver” sufficient to&para;<br>carry the prosecution’s burden. See Butler, supra, at 373.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>(hereinafter Inbau) (“Once [a] waiver is given, the police may proceed&para;<br>with the interrogation”); D. Zulawski &amp; D. Wicklander, Practical&para;<br>Aspects of Interview and Interrogation 55 (2d ed. 2002) (“Only upon the&para;<br>waiver of th[e] [Miranda] rights by the suspect can an interrogation&para;<br>occur”); see also Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense&para;<br>Lawyers et al. as Amici Curiae 11–12 (hereinafter NACDL brief)&para;<br>(collecting authorities).&para;<br>4 Although such decisions are not controlling under AEDPA, it is&para;<br>notable that lower courts have similarly required a showing of words or&para;<br>conduct beyond inculpatory statements. See, e.g., United States v.&para;<br>Wallace, 848 F. 2d 1464, 1475 (CA9 1988) (no implied waiver when&para;<br>warned suspect “maintained her silence for . . . perhap[s] as many as&para;<br>ten minutes” before answering a question); McDonald v. Lucas, 677&para;<br>F. 2d 518, 521–522 (CA5 1982) (no implied waiver when defendant&para;<br>refused to sign waiver and there was “no evidence of words or actions&para;<br>implying a waiver, except the [inculpatory] statement”). Generally,&para;<br>courts have found implied waiver when a warned suspect has made&para;<br>incriminating statements “as part of a steady stream of speech or as&para;<br>part of a back-and-forth conversation with the police,” or when a&para;<br>warned suspect who previously invoked his right “spontaneously&para;<br>recommences the dialogue with his interviewers.” Bui v.

Indeed,&para;<br>Michigan and the United States concede that no waiver&para;<br>occurred in this case until Thompkins responded “yes” to&para;<br>the questions about God. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7, 30. I&para;<br>believe it is objectively unreasonable under our clearly&para;<br>established precedents to conclude the prosecution met its&para;<br>“heavy burden” of proof on a record consisting of three one­&para;<br>word answers, following 2 hours and 45 minutes of silence&para;<br>punctuated by a few largely nonverbal responses to uni­&para;<br>dentified questions.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Perhaps because our prior Miranda precedents so&para;<br>clearly favor Thompkins, the Court today goes beyond&para;<br>AEDPA’s deferential standard of review and announces a&para;<br>new general principle of law.

Indeed, we have in the&para;<br>past summarily reversed a state-court decision that in­&para;<br>verted Miranda’s antiwaiver presumption, characterizing&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the error as “readily apparent.” Tague, 444 U. S., at 470–&para;<br>471. At best, the Court today creates an unworkable and&para;<br>conflicting set of presumptions that will undermine&para;<br>Miranda’s goal of providing “concrete constitutional guide­&para;<br>lines for law enforcement agencies and courts to follow,”&para;<br>384 U. S., at 442. At worst, it overrules sub silentio an&para;<br>essential aspect of the protections Miranda has long pro­&para;<br>vided for the constitutional guarantee against self­&para;<br>incrimination.&para;<br>The Court’s conclusion that Thompkins’ inculpatory&para;<br>statements were sufficient to establish an implied waiver,&para;<br>ante, at 14, finds no support in Butler. Butler itself distin­&para;<br>guished between a sufficient “course of conduct” and in­&para;<br>culpatory statements, reiterating Miranda’s admonition&para;<br>that “ ‘a valid waiver will not be presumed simply from . . .&para;<br>the fact that a confession was in fact eventually ob­&para;<br>tained.’ ” Butler, supra, at 373 (quoting Miranda, supra,&para;<br>at 475). Michigan suggests Butler’s silence “ ‘when ad­&para;<br>vised of his right to the assistance of a lawyer,’ ” combined&para;<br>with our remand for the state court to apply the implied­&para;<br>waiver standard, shows that silence followed by state­&para;<br>ments can be a “ ‘course of conduct.’ ” Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>26 (quoting Butler, supra, at 371). But the evidence of&para;<br>implied waiver in Butler was worlds apart from the evi­&para;<br>dence in this case, because Butler unequivocally said “I&para;<br>will talk to you” after having been read Miranda warn­&para;<br>ings. Thompkins, of course, made no such statement.&para;<br>The Court also relies heavily on Burbine in characteriz­&para;<br>ing the scope of the prosecution’s burden in proving&para;<br>waiver. Consistent with Burbine, the Court observes, the&para;<br>prosecution must prove that waiver was “ ‘voluntary in the&para;<br>sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate&para;<br>choice rather than intimidation’ ” and “ ‘made with a full&para;<br>awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned&para;<br>and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.’ ” Ante,&para;<br>at 10 (quoting 475 U.

What it omits, however, is&para;<br>that the prosecution also bears an antecedent burden of&para;<br>showing there was, in fact, either an express waiver or a&para;<br>“course of conduct” sufficiently clear to support a finding of&para;<br>implied waiver. Nothing in Burbine even hints at remov­&para;<br>ing that obligation. The question in that case, rather, was&para;<br>whether a suspect’s multiple express waivers of his rights&para;<br>were invalid because police “misinformed an inquiring&para;<br>attorney about their plans concerning the suspect or be­&para;<br>cause they failed to inform the suspect of the attorney’s&para;<br>efforts to reach him.” Id., at 420; see also Colorado v.&para;<br>Spring, 479 U. S. 564, 573 (1987). The Court’s analysis in&para;<br>Burbine was predicated on the existence of waiver-in-fact.&para;<br>Today’s dilution of the prosecution’s burden of proof to&para;<br>the bare fact that a suspect made inculpatory statements&para;<br>after Miranda warnings were given and understood takes&para;<br>an unprecedented step away from the “high standards of&para;<br>proof for the waiver of constitutional rights” this Court has&para;<br>long demanded. Miranda, supra, at 475; cf. Brewer v.&para;<br>Williams, 430 U. S. 387, 404 (1977) (“[C]ourts indulge in&para;<br>every reasonable presumption against waiver”); Zerbst,&para;<br>304 U. S., at 464. When waiver is to be inferred during a&para;<br>custodial interrogation, there are sound reasons to require&para;<br>evidence beyond inculpatory statements themselves.&para;<br>Miranda and our subsequent cases are premised on the&para;<br>idea that custodial interrogation is inherently coercive.&para;<br>See 384 U.

The underlying constitutional guar­&para;<br>antee against self-incrimination reflects “many of our&para;<br>fundamental values and most noble aspirations,” our&para;<br>society’s “preference for an accusatorial rather than an&para;<br>inquisitorial system of criminal justice”; a “fear that self­&para;<br>incriminating statements will be elicited by inhumane&para;<br>treatment and abuses” and a resulting “distrust of self­&para;<br>deprecatory statements”; and a realization that while the&para;<br>privilege is “sometimes a shelter to the guilty, [it] is often&para;<br>a protection to the innocent.” Withrow v.

Such a result bears little sem­&para;<br>blance to the “fully effective” prophylaxis, 384 U. S., at&para;<br>444, that Miranda requires.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Thompkins’ claim for relief under AEDPA rests on the&para;<br>clearly established federal law of Miranda and Mosley. In&para;<br>Miranda, the Court concluded that “[i]f [an] individual&para;<br>indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during&para;<br>questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interro­&para;<br>gation must cease. . . . [A]ny statement taken after the&para;<br>person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the&para;<br>product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise.” 384 U. S., at&para;<br>473–474. In Mosley, the Court said that a “critical safe­&para;<br>guard” of the right to remain silent is a suspect’s “ ‘right to&para;<br>cut off questioning.’ ” 423 U. S., at 103 (quoting Miranda,&para;<br>supra, at 474). Thus, “the admissibility of statements&para;<br>obtained after the person in custody has decided to remain&para;<br>silent depends under Miranda on whether his ‘right to cut&para;<br>off questioning’ was ‘scrupulously honored.’ ” 423 U.

In Michigan’s&para;<br>view, Thompkins cannot prevail under AEDPA because&para;<br>this Court’s precedents have not previously established&para;<br>whether a suspect’s ambiguous statements or actions&para;<br>require the police to stop questioning. We have held that&para;<br>a suspect who has “ ‘invoked his right to have counsel&para;<br>present . . . is not subject to further interrogation by the&para;<br>authorities until counsel has been made available to him,&para;<br>unless [he] initiates further communication, exchanges, or&para;<br>conversations with the police.’ ” Maryland v.

Notwithstanding&para;<br>Miranda’s statement that “there can be no questioning” if&para;<br>a suspect “indicates in any manner . . . that he wishes to&para;<br>consult with an attorney,” 384 U. S., at 444–445, the Court&para;<br>in Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452, 461 (1994) estab­&para;<br>lished a clear-statement rule for invoking the right to&para;<br>counsel.

That the state court’s&para;<br>decision was not objectively unreasonable is confirmed, in&para;<br>Michigan’s view, by the number of federal Courts of Ap­&para;<br>peals to have applied Davis to invocation of the right to&para;<br>silence.

Because Thompkins&para;<br>neither said “he wanted to remain silent” nor said “he did&para;<br>not want to talk with the police,” the Court concludes, he&para;<br>did not clearly invoke his right to silence. Ante, at 8–10.6&para;<br>I disagree with this novel application of Davis. Neither&para;<br>the rationale nor holding of that case compels today’s&para;<br>result. Davis involved the right to counsel, not the right to&para;<br>silence. The Court in Davis reasoned that extending&para;<br>Edwards’ “rigid” prophylactic rule to ambiguous requests&para;<br>for a lawyer would transform Miranda into a “ ‘wholly&para;<br>irrational obstacl[e] to legitimate police investigative&para;<br>activity’ ” by “needlessly prevent[ing] the police from ques­&para;<br>tioning a suspect in the absence of counsel even if [he] did&para;<br>not wish to have a lawyer present.” Davis, supra, at 460.&para;<br>But Miranda itself “distinguished between the procedural&para;<br>safeguards triggered by a request to remain silent and a&para;<br>request for an attorney.” Mosley, supra, at 104, n. 10;&para;<br>accord, Edwards, supra, at 485.

Because the Sixth Circuit declined to&para;<br>decide Thompkins’ invocation claim, a remand would permit the lower&para;<br>court to address the question in the first instance. Cf. Cutter v.

To the extent Mosley contem­&para;<br>plates a more flexible form of prophylaxis than Edwards—&para;<br>and, in particular, does not categorically bar police from&para;<br>reapproaching a suspect who has invoked his right to&para;<br>remain silent—Davis’ concern about “ ‘wholly irrational&para;<br>obstacles’ ” to police investigation applies with less force.&para;<br>In addition, the suspect’s equivocal reference to a lawyer&para;<br>in Davis occurred only after he had given express oral and&para;<br>written waivers of his rights. Davis’ holding is explicitly&para;<br>predicated on that fact. See 512 U. S., at 461 (“We there­&para;<br>fore hold that, after a knowing and voluntary waiver of the&para;<br>Miranda rights, law enforcement officers may continue&para;<br>questioning until and unless the suspect clearly requests&para;<br>an attorney”).

Under such&para;<br>circumstances, “scrupulous” respect for the suspect’s&para;<br>rights will require police to terminate questioning under&para;<br>Mosley.8&para;<br>To be sure, such a standard does not provide police with&para;<br>a bright-line rule. Cf. ante, at 9–10.

Thompkins’ amici collect a range of training materials that&para;<br>instruct police not to engage in prolonged interrogation after a suspect&para;<br>has failed to respond to initial questioning. See NACDL Brief 32–34.&para;<br>One widely used police manual, for example, teaches that a suspect&para;<br>who “indicates,” “even by silence itself,” his unwillingness to answer&para;<br>questions “has obviously exercised his constitutional privilege against&para;<br>self-incrimination.” Inbau 498.&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>day’s clear-statement rule is necessary to ensure effective&para;<br>law enforcement.&para;<br>Davis’ clear-statement rule is also a poor fit for the right&para;<br>to silence. Advising a suspect that he has a “right to&para;<br>remain silent” is unlikely to convey that he must speak&para;<br>(and must do so in some particular fashion) to ensure the&para;<br>right will be protected. Cf. Soffar v. Cockrell, 300 F. 3d&para;<br>588, 603 (CA5 2002) (en banc) (DeMoss, J., dissenting)&para;<br>(“What in the world must an individual do to exercise his&para;<br>constitutional right to remain silent beyond actually, in&para;<br>fact, remaining silent?”). By contrast, telling a suspect “he&para;<br>has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he&para;<br>cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him&para;<br>prior to any questioning if he so desires,” Miranda, 384&para;<br>U. S., at 479, implies the need for speech to exercise that&para;<br>right. Davis’ requirement that a suspect must “clearly&para;<br>reques[t] an attorney” to terminate questioning thus&para;<br>aligns with a suspect’s likely understanding of the&para;<br>Miranda warnings in a way today’s rule does not. The&para;<br>Court suggests Thompkins could have employed the “sim­&para;<br>ple, unambiguous” means of saying “he wanted to remain&para;<br>silent” or “did not want to talk with the police.” Ante, at&para;<br>10. But the Miranda warnings give no hint that a suspect&para;<br>should use those magic words, and there is little reason to&para;<br>believe police—who have ample incentives to avoid invoca­&para;<br>tion—will provide such guidance.&para;<br>Conversely, the Court’s concern that police will face&para;<br>“difficult decisions about an accused’s unclear intent” and&para;<br>suffer the consequences of “ ‘guess[ing] wrong,’ ” ante, at 9–&para;<br>10 (quoting Davis, 512 U. S., at 461), is misplaced. If a&para;<br>suspect makes an ambiguous statement or engages in&para;<br>conduct that creates uncertainty about his intent to invoke&para;<br>his right, police can simply ask for clarification. See id., at&para;<br>467 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). It is hardly an&para;<br>unreasonable burden for police to ask a suspect, for in­&para;<br>stance, “Do you want to talk to us?” The majority in Davis&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Given this straight­&para;<br>forward mechanism by which police can “scrupulously&para;<br>hono[r]” a suspect’s right to silence, today’s clear­&para;<br>statement rule can only be seen as accepting “as tolerable&para;<br>the certainty that some poorly expressed requests [to&para;<br>remain silent] will be disregarded,” id., at 471 (opinion of&para;<br>Souter, J.), without any countervailing benefit. Police may&para;<br>well prefer not to seek clarification of an ambiguous&para;<br>statement out of fear that a suspect will invoke his rights.&para;<br>But “our system of justice is not founded on a fear that a&para;<br>suspect will exercise his rights. ‘If the exercise of constitu­&para;<br>tional rights will thwart the effectiveness of a system of&para;<br>law enforcement, then there is something very wrong with&para;<br>that system.’ ” Burbine, 475 U.

A&para;<br>number of lower courts that have (erroneously, in my&para;<br>view) imposed a clear-statement requirement for invoca­&para;<br>tion of the right to silence have rejected as ambiguous an&para;<br>array of statements whose meaning might otherwise be&para;<br>thought plain.9 At a minimum, these decisions suggest&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 See United States v.

I’ve&para;<br>been through enough today’ ” ambiguous because it could be construed&para;<br>as part of “ ‘thrust-and-parry’ ” between suspect and interrogator); State&para;<br>v.

I wish I’d . . .&para;<br>don’t wish to answer any more questions’ ” ambiguous because condi­&para;<br>tioned on officer’s implication that suspect committed specific assault).&para;<br>Courts have also construed statements as expressing a desire to remain&para;<br>silent only about a particular subject.

Criminal&para;<br>suspects must now unambiguously invoke their right to&para;<br>remain silent—which, counterintuitively, requires them to&para;<br>speak. At the same time, suspects will be legally pre­&para;<br>sumed to have waived their rights even if they have given&para;<br>no clear expression of their intent to do so. Those results,&para;<br>in my view, find no basis in Miranda or our subsequent&para;<br>cases and are inconsistent with the fair-trial principles on&para;<br>which those precedents are grounded. Today’s broad new&para;<br>rules are all the more unfortunate because they are un­&para;<br>necessary to the disposition of the case before us.
