UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE TENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–367.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued April 20, 2010—Decided June 14, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner Dolan pleaded guilty to assault resulting in serious bodily&para;<br>injury and entered into a plea agreement, which stated that the Dis&para;<br>trict Court could order restitution for his victim. Dolan’s presentence&para;<br>report also noted that restitution was required, but did not recom&para;<br>mend an amount because of a lack of information on hospital costs&para;<br>and lost wages. The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act provides&para;<br>that “if the victim’s losses are not ascertainable by the date that is 10&para;<br>days prior to sentencing,” the court “shall set a date for the final de&para;<br>termination of the victim’s losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentenc&para;<br>ing.” 18 U. S. C. §3664(d)(5). On July 30, the District Court held a&para;<br>sentencing hearing and imposed a sentence of imprisonment and su&para;<br>pervised release. On August 8, the court entered a judgment, stating&para;<br>that restitution was “applicable” but leaving open the amount of res&para;<br>titution given that no information had yet “been received regarding&para;<br>possible restitution payments.” On October 5, 67 days later, an ad&para;<br>dendum documenting the restitution amount was added to the pre&para;<br>sentence report. The court did not set a hearing until February 4,&para;<br>about three months after the 90-day deadline had expired. At the&para;<br>hearing, Dolan argued that because that deadline had passed, the&para;<br>law no longer authorized restitution. Disagreeing, the court ordered&para;<br>restitution, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: A sentencing court that misses the 90-day deadline nonetheless&para;<br>retains the power to order restitution—at least where, as here, that&para;<br>court made clear prior to the deadline’s expiration that it would order&para;<br>restitution, leaving open (for more than 90 days) only the amount.&para;<br>Pp. 3–15.&para;<br>(a) To determine the consequences of a missed deadline where, as&para;<br>here, the statute does not specify them, this Court looks to the statu&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DOLAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tory language, to the relevant context, and to what they reveal about&para;<br>the deadline’s purposes. A “jurisdictional” deadline’s expiration pre&para;<br>vents a court from permitting or taking the action to which the stat&para;<br>ute attached the deadline. The prohibition is absolute. It cannot be&para;<br>waived or extended for equitable reasons. See John R. Sand &amp;&para;<br>Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133–134. Other deadlines&para;<br>are “claims-processing rules,” which do not limit a court’s jurisdiction,&para;<br>but regulate the timing of motions or claims brought before the court.&para;<br>Unless a party points out that another litigant has missed such a&para;<br>deadline, the party forfeits the deadline’s protection. See, e.g., Kon&para;<br>trick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 454–456. In other instances, a deadline&para;<br>seeks speed by creating a time-related directive that is legally en&para;<br>forceable but does not deprive the judge or other public official of the&para;<br>power to take the action even if the deadline is missed. See, e.g.,&para;<br>United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S. 711, 722. In light of its&para;<br>language, context, and purposes, the statute at issue sets forth this&para;<br>third kind of limitation. The fact that a sentencing court misses the&para;<br>90-day deadline, even through its own or the Government’s fault,&para;<br>does not deprive the court of the power to order restitution. Pp. 3–5.&para;<br>(b) Several considerations lead to this conclusion. First, where, as&para;<br>here, a statute “does not specify a consequence for noncompliance&para;<br>with” its “timing provisions,” “federal courts will not” ordinarily “im&para;<br>pose their own coercive sanction.” United States v. James Daniel&para;<br>Good Real Property, 510 U. S. 43, 63. A statute’s use of “shall” alone,&para;<br>see §3664(d)(5), does not necessarily bar judges from taking the ac&para;<br>tion to which the missed deadline refers. Second, the statute places&para;<br>primary weight on, and emphasizes the importance of, imposing res&para;<br>titution upon those convicted of certain federal crimes. See §3663A.&para;<br>Third, the statute’s procedural provisions reinforce this substantive&para;<br>purpose. They reveal that the statute seeks speed primarily to help&para;<br>crime victims secure prompt restitution, not to provide defendants&para;<br>with certainty as to the amount of their liability. Fourth, to read the&para;<br>statute as depriving the sentencing court of the power to order resti&para;<br>tution would harm the victims, who likely bear no responsibility for&para;<br>the deadline’s being missed and whom the statute seeks to benefit.&para;<br>That kind of harm to third parties provides a strong indication that&para;<br>Congress did not intend a missed deadline to work a forfeiture. See&para;<br>Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U. S. 253, 262. Fifth, the Court has in&para;<br>terpreted similar statutes, such as the Bail Reform Act of 1984, simi&para;<br>larly. See Montalvo-Murillo, supra, at 721. Sixth, the defendant nor&para;<br>mally can mitigate potential harm by telling the court that he fears&para;<br>the deadline will be, or just has been, missed, and the court will&para;<br>likely set a timely hearing or take other statutorily required action.&para;<br>Pp. 5–10.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(c) This Court has not understated the potential harm to a defen&para;<br>dant of a missed deadline. Petitioner claims that because the sen&para;<br>tence will not be a “final judgment” for appeal purposes without a de&para;<br>finitive determination of the restitution amount, to delay that&para;<br>determination beyond the deadline is to delay his ability to appeal.&para;<br>But a defendant who knows that restitution will be ordered and is&para;<br>aware of the amount can usually avoid additional delay by asking for&para;<br>a timely hearing; if the court refuses, he could seek mandamus. And&para;<br>in the unlikely instance that delay causes the defendant prejudice, he&para;<br>remains free to ask the appellate court to take that fact and any&para;<br>other equitable considerations into account on review. This does not&para;<br>mean that the Court accepts petitioner’s premise that a sentencing&para;<br>judgment is not “final” until the restitution amount is determined.&para;<br>Although that question need not be decided here, strong arguments&para;<br>favor the appealability of the initial judgment irrespective of the de&para;<br>lay in determining the restitution amount. A judgment imposing&para;<br>“ ‘discipline’ ” may still be “freighted with sufficiently substantial in&para;<br>dicia of finality to support an appeal.” Corey v. United States, 375&para;<br>U. S. 169, 174. And several statutes say that a “judgment of convic&para;<br>tion” that “includes” “imprisonment” is a “final judgment.” E.g., 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §3582(b). Moreover, §3664(o) provides that a “sentence that&para;<br>imposes an order of restitution,” such as the later restitution order&para;<br>here, “is a final judgment.” Even assuming that the rule of lenity&para;<br>could be applied to a statutory time provision in the criminal context,&para;<br>here there is no statutory ambiguity sufficiently grievous to warrant&para;<br>its application in this case.

The statute in question focuses upon mandatory&para;<br>restitution for victims of crimes. It provides that “the&para;<br>court shall set a date for the final determination of the&para;<br>victim’s losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing.” 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §3664(d)(5). We hold that a sentencing court that&para;<br>misses the 90-day deadline nonetheless retains the power&para;<br>to order restitution—at least where, as here, the sentenc&para;<br>ing court made clear prior to the deadline’s expiration that&para;<br>it would order restitution, leaving open (for more than 90&para;<br>days) only the amount.&para;<br>I&para;<br>On February 8, 2007, petitioner Brian Dolan pleaded&para;<br>guilty to a federal charge of assault resulting in serious&para;<br>bodily injury. 18 U. S. C. §§113(a)(6), 1153; App. 17. He&para;<br>entered into a plea agreement that stated that “restitution&para;<br>. . . may be ordered by the Court.” Id., at 18. The presen&para;<br>tence report, provided to the court by the end of May,&para;<br>noted that restitution was required. But, lacking precise&para;<br>information about hospital costs and lost wages, it did not&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DOLAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>recommend a restitution amount. Id., at 27.&para;<br>On July 30, the District Court held Dolan’s sentencing&para;<br>hearing. The judge sentenced Dolan to 21 months’ impris&para;<br>onment along with 3 years of supervised release. Id., at&para;<br>38. The judge, aware that restitution was “mandatory,”&para;<br>said that there was “insufficient information on the record&para;<br>at this time regarding possible restitution payments that&para;<br>may be owed,” that he would “leave that matter open,&para;<br>pending the receipt of additional information,” and that&para;<br>Dolan could “anticipate that such an award will be made&para;<br>in the future.” Id., at 39–40. A few days later (August 8)&para;<br>the court entered a judgment, which, among other things,&para;<br>stated:&para;<br>“Pursuant to the Mandatory Restitution Act, restitu&para;<br>tion is applicable; however, no information has been&para;<br>received regarding possible restitution payments that&para;<br>may be owed. Therefore, the Court will not order res&para;<br>titution at this time.” Id., at 49 (boldface deleted).&para;<br>The probation office later prepared an addendum to the&para;<br>presentence report, dated October 5, which reflected the&para;<br>views of the parties, and which the judge later indicated&para;<br>he had received. Id., at 54. The addendum documents the&para;<br>“total amount of restitution” due in the case (about&para;<br>$105,000). Id., at 52. Its date, October 5, is 67 days after&para;<br>Dolan’s July 30 sentencing and 23 days before the stat&para;<br>ute’s “90 days after sentencing” deadline would expire.&para;<br>§3664(d)(5).&para;<br>The sentencing court nonetheless set a restitution hear&para;<br>ing for February 4, 2008—about three months after the&para;<br>90-day deadline expired. As far as the record shows, no&para;<br>one asked the court for an earlier hearing. At the hearing,&para;<br>Dolan pointed out that the 90-day deadline had passed.&para;<br>Id., at 54–55. And he argued that the law no longer au&para;<br>thorized the court to order restitution. Id., at 60–64.&para;<br>The court disagreed and ordered restitution.&para;<br>See&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Memorandum Opinion and Restitution Order in No. CR&para;<br>06–02173–RB (D NM, Apr. 24, 2008), App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>47a. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 571 F. 3d 1022&para;<br>(CA10 2009). And, in light of differences among the&para;<br>Courts of Appeals, we granted Dolan’s petition for certio&para;<br>rari on the question. Compare United States v. Cheal, 389&para;<br>F. 3d 35 (CA1 2004) (recognizing court’s authority to enter&para;<br>restitution order past 90 days) and United States v. Balen&para;<br>tine, 569 F. 3d 801 (CA8 2009) (same), with United States&para;<br>v. Maung, 267 F. 3d 1113 (CA11 2001) (finding no such&para;<br>authority), and United States v. Farr, 419 F. 3d 621 (CA7&para;<br>2005) (same).&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>There is no doubt in this case that the court missed the&para;<br>90-day statutory deadline “for the final determination of&para;<br>the victim’s losses.” §3664(d)(5). No one has offered any&para;<br>excuse for the court’s doing so. Nor did any party seek an&para;<br>extension or “tolling” of the 90 days for equitable or for&para;<br>other reasons. All the information needed to determine&para;<br>the requisite restitution amount was available before the&para;<br>90-day period had ended. Thus, the question before us&para;<br>concerns the consequences of the missed deadline where,&para;<br>as here, the statute does not specify them.&para;<br>In answering this kind of question, this Court has&para;<br>looked to statutory language, to the relevant context, and&para;<br>to what they reveal about the purposes that a time limit is&para;<br>designed to serve. The Court’s answers have varied de&para;<br>pending upon the particular statute and time limit at&para;<br>issue. Sometimes we have found that the statute in ques&para;<br>tion imposes a “jurisdictional” condition upon, for example,&para;<br>a court’s authority to hear a case, to consider pleadings, or&para;<br>to act upon motions that a party seeks to file. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007). But cf. Kontrick v.&para;<br>Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 455 (2004) (finding bankruptcy rule&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>DOLAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>did not show legislative intent to “delineat[e] the classes of&para;<br>cases” and “persons” properly “within a court’s adjudica&para;<br>tory authority”); see also Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick,&para;<br>559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5–6) (discussing use&para;<br>of term “jurisdictional”). The expiration of a “jurisdic&para;<br>tional” deadline prevents the court from permitting or&para;<br>taking the action to which the statute attached the dead&para;<br>line. The prohibition is absolute. The parties cannot&para;<br>waive it, nor can a court extend that deadline for equitable&para;<br>reasons. See John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States,&para;<br>552 U. S. 130, 133–134 (2008).&para;<br>In other instances, we have found that certain deadlines&para;<br>are more ordinary “claims-processing rules,” rules that do&para;<br>not limit a court’s jurisdiction, but rather regulate the&para;<br>timing of motions or claims brought before the court.&para;<br>Unless a party points out to the court that another litigant&para;<br>has missed such a deadline, the party forfeits the dead&para;<br>line’s protection. See, e.g., Kontrick v. Ryan, supra, at&para;<br>454–456 (60-day bankruptcy rule deadline for creditor’s&para;<br>objection to debtor discharge); Eberhart v. United States,&para;<br>546 U. S. 12, 19 (2005) (per curiam) (7-day criminal rule&para;<br>deadline for filing motion for a new trial).&para;<br>In still other instances, we have found that a deadline&para;<br>seeks speed by creating a time-related directive that is&para;<br>legally enforceable but does not deprive a judge or other&para;<br>public official of the power to take the action to which the&para;<br>deadline applies if the deadline is missed. See, e.g.,&para;<br>United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S. 711, 722&para;<br>(1990) (missed deadline for holding bail detention hearing&para;<br>does not require judge to release defendant); Brock v.&para;<br>Pierce County, 476 U. S. 253, 266 (1986) (missed deadline&para;<br>for making final determination as to misuse of federal&para;<br>grant funds does not prevent later recovery of funds);&para;<br>Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S. 149, 171–172&para;<br>(2003) (missed deadline for assigning industry retiree&para;<br>benefits does not prevent later award of benefits).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>After examining the language, the context, and the&para;<br>purposes of the statute, we conclude that the provision&para;<br>before us sets forth this third kind of limitation. The&para;<br>fact that a sentencing court misses the statute’s 90-day&para;<br>deadline, even through its own fault or that of the Gov&para;<br>ernment, does not deprive the court of the power to order&para;<br>restitution.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Several considerations lead us to this conclusion. First,&para;<br>where, as here, a statute “does not specify a consequence&para;<br>for noncompliance with” its “timing provisions,” “federal&para;<br>courts will not in the ordinary course impose their own&para;<br>coercive sanction.” United States v. James Daniel Good&para;<br>Real Property, 510 U. S. 43, 63 (1993); see also MontalvoMurillo, supra, at 717–721. Cf., e.g., Speedy Trial Act, 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §3161(c)(1); §3162(a)(2) (statute specifying that&para;<br>missed 70-day deadline requires dismissal of indictment);&para;<br>Zedner v. United States, 547 U. S. 489, 507–509 (2006)&para;<br>(“The sanction for a violation of the Act is dismissal”).&para;<br>We concede that the statute here uses the word “shall,”&para;<br>§3664(d)(5), but a statute’s use of that word alone has not&para;<br>always led this Court to interpret statutes to bar judges&para;<br>(or other officials) from taking the action to which a&para;<br>missed statutory deadline refers. See, e.g., MontalvoMurillo, supra, at 718–719 (use of word “shall” in context&para;<br>of bail hearing makes duty “mandatory” but does not&para;<br>mean that the “sanction for breach” is “loss of all later&para;<br>powers to act”); Brock, supra, at 262 (same in context of&para;<br>misuse of federal funds); Barnhart, supra, at 158–163&para;<br>(same in context of benefits assignments). See also Re&para;<br>gions Hospital v. Shalala, 522 U. S. 448, 459, n. 3 (1998)&para;<br>(same in respect to federal official’s reporting date).&para;<br>Second, the statute’s text places primary weight upon,&para;<br>and emphasizes the importance of, imposing restitution&para;<br>upon those convicted of certain federal crimes. Amending&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>DOLAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>an older provision that left restitution to the sentencing&para;<br>judge’s discretion, the statute before us (entitled “The&para;<br>Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996”) says&para;<br>“[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, when sen&para;<br>tencing a defendant convicted of [a specified] offense . . . ,&para;<br>the court shall order . . . that the defendant make restitu&para;<br>tion to the victim of the offense.” §3663A(a)(1) (emphasis&para;<br>added); cf. §3663(a)(1) (stating that a court “may” order&para;<br>restitution when sentencing defendants convicted of other&para;<br>specified crimes). The Act goes on to provide that restitu&para;<br>tion shall be ordered in the “full amount of each victim’s&para;<br>losses” and “without consideration of the economic circum&para;<br>stances of the defendant.” §3664(f)(1)(A).&para;<br>Third, the Act’s procedural provisions reinforce this&para;<br>substantive purpose, namely, that the statute seeks pri&para;<br>marily to assure that victims of a crime receive full resti&para;<br>tution. To be sure speed is important. The statute re&para;<br>quires a sentencing judge to order the probation office to&para;<br>prepare a report providing “a complete accounting of the&para;<br>losses to each victim, any restitution owed pursuant to a&para;<br>plea agreement, and information relating to the economic&para;<br>circumstances of each defendant.” §3664(a). The prosecu&para;<br>tor, after consulting with all identified victims, must&para;<br>“promptly provide” a listing of the amount subject to resti&para;<br>tution “not later than 60 days prior to the date initially set&para;<br>for sentencing.” §3664(d)(1) (emphasis added). And the&para;<br>provision before us says:&para;<br>“If the victim’s losses are not ascertainable by the date&para;<br>that is 10 days prior to sentencing, the attorney for&para;<br>the Government or the probation officer shall so in&para;<br>form the court, and the court shall set a date for the&para;<br>final determination of the victim’s losses, not to ex&para;<br>ceed 90 days after sentencing.” §3664(d)(5).&para;<br>But the statute seeks speed primarily to help the victims&para;<br>of crime and only secondarily to help the defendant. Thus,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>in the sentence following the language we have just&para;<br>quoted, the statute continues:&para;<br>“If the victim subsequently discovers further losses,&para;<br>the victim shall have 60 days after discovery of those&para;<br>losses in which to petition the court for an amended&para;<br>restitution order.” Ibid.&para;<br>The sentence imposes no time limit on the victim’s subse&para;<br>quent discovery of losses. Consequently, a court might&para;<br>award restitution for those losses long after the original&para;<br>sentence was imposed and the 90-day time limit has ex&para;<br>pired. That fact, along with the Act’s main substantive&para;<br>objectives, is why we say that the Act’s efforts to secure&para;<br>speedy determination of restitution is primarily designed&para;<br>to help victims of crime secure prompt restitution rather&para;<br>than to provide defendants with certainty as to the&para;<br>amount of their liability. Cf. S. Rep. No. 104–179, p. 20&para;<br>(1995) (recognizing “the need for finality and certainty in&para;<br>the sentencing process,” but also stating that the “sole due&para;<br>process interest of the defendant being protected . . . is the&para;<br>right not to be sentenced on the basis of invalid premises&para;<br>or inaccurate information”); see also ibid. (“[J]ustice can&para;<br>not be considered served until full restitution is made”).&para;<br>Fourth, to read the statute as depriving the sentencing&para;<br>court of the power to order restitution would harm those—&para;<br>the victims of crime—who likely bear no responsibility for&para;<br>the deadline’s being missed and whom the statute also&para;<br>seeks to benefit. Cf. §3664(g)(1) (“No victim shall be re&para;<br>quired to participate in any phase of a restitution order”).&para;<br>The potential for such harm—to third parties—normally&para;<br>provides a strong indication that Congress did not intend&para;<br>a missed deadline to work a forfeiture, here depriving a&para;<br>court of the power to award restitution to victims. See&para;<br>Brock, 476 U. S., at 262 (parties concede and court as&para;<br>sumes that official can “proceed after the deadline” where&para;<br>“inaction” would hurt third party); see also 3 N. Singer &amp;&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>DOLAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>J. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction §57:19,&para;<br>pp. 73–74 (7th ed. 2008) (hereinafter Singer, Statutory&para;<br>Construction) (missing a deadline does not remove power&para;<br>to exercise a duty where there is no “language denying&para;<br>performance after a specified time,” and especially “where&para;<br>a mandatory construction might do great injury to persons&para;<br>not at fault, as in a case where slight delay on the part of a&para;<br>public officer might prejudice private rights or the public&para;<br>interest” (footnote omitted)).&para;<br>Fifth, we have previously interpreted similar statutes&para;<br>similarly. In Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S. 711, for exam&para;<br>ple, we considered the Bail Reform Act of 1984, which&para;<br>states that a “judicial officer shall hold a hearing” to de&para;<br>termine whether to grant bail to an arrested person and&para;<br>that “hearing shall be held immediately upon the person’s&para;<br>first appearance before the judicial officer.” (A continuance&para;<br>of up to five days may also be granted.) 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§3142(f) (emphasis added). The judicial officer missed this&para;<br>deadline, but the Court held that the judicial officer need&para;<br>not release the detained person. Rather, “once the Gov&para;<br>ernment discovers that the time limits have expired, it&para;<br>may [still] ask for a prompt detention hearing and make&para;<br>its case to detain based upon the requirements set forth in&para;<br>the statute.” 495 U. S., at 721.&para;<br>The Court reasoned that “a failure to comply” with the&para;<br>hearing deadline “does not so subvert the procedural&para;<br>scheme . . . as to invalidate the hearing.” Id., at 717.&para;<br>Missing the deadline did not diminish the strength of the&para;<br>Government’s interest in preventing release to avert the&para;<br>likely commission of crimes—the very objective of the Act.&para;<br>Id., at 720. Nor would mandatory release of the detained&para;<br>person “proportion[ately]” repair the “inconvenience and&para;<br>uncertainty a timely hearing would have spared him.” Id.,&para;<br>at 721.&para;<br>Here, as in Montalvo-Murillo, neither the language nor&para;<br>the structure of the statute requires denying the victim&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>restitution in order to remedy a missed hearing deadline.&para;<br>As in Montalvo-Murillo, doing so would defeat the basic&para;<br>purpose of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. And,&para;<br>here, as in Montalvo-Murillo, that remedy does not “pro&para;<br>portion[ately]” repair the harm caused the defendant&para;<br>through delay, particularly where, as here, the defendant&para;<br>“knew about restitution,” including the likely amount, well&para;<br>before expiration of the 90-day time limit. App. 62. In&para;<br>deed, our result here follows from Montalvo-Murillo a&para;<br>fortiori, for here delay at worst postpones the day of finan&para;<br>cial reckoning. In Montalvo-Murillo, delay postponed a&para;<br>constitutionally guaranteed bail hearing with the attached&para;<br>risk that the defendant would remain improperly confined&para;<br>in jail. See 495 U. S., at 728 (STEVENS, J., dissenting)&para;<br>(noting the seriousness “of the deprivation of liberty that&para;<br>physical detention imposes”).&para;<br>Nor does Montalvo-Murillo stand alone. The Court&para;<br>there found support in similar cases involving executive&para;<br>officials charged with carrying out mandatory public&para;<br>duties in a timely manner. See id., at 718 (citing French v.&para;<br>Edwards, 13 Wall. 506, 511 (1872); Brock, supra, at 260).&para;<br>Those cases, in turn, are consistent with numerous similar&para;<br>decisions made by courts throughout the Nation. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Taylor v. Department of Transp., 260 N. W. 2d 521, 522–&para;<br>523 (Iowa 1977); Hutchinson v. Ryan, 154 Kan. 751, 756–&para;<br>757, 121 P. 2d 179, 182 (1942); State v. Industrial&para;<br>Comm’n, 233 Wis. 461, 466, 289 N. W. 769, 771 (1940); see&para;<br>also 3 Singer, Statutory Construction §57:19, at 74 (citing&para;<br>cases).&para;<br>Sixth, the defendant normally can mitigate any harm&para;<br>that a missed deadline might cause—at least if, as here,&para;<br>he obtains the relevant information regarding the restitu&para;<br>tion amount before the 90-day deadline expires. A defen&para;<br>dant who fears the deadline will be (or just has been)&para;<br>missed can simply tell the court, which will then likely set&para;<br>a timely hearing or take other statutorily required action.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>DOLAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>See §3664(d)(4) (providing that “court may require addi&para;<br>tional documentation or hear testimony”); §3664(d)(5).&para;<br>Though a deliberate failure of the sentencing court to&para;<br>comply with the statute seems improbable, should that&para;<br>occur, the defendant can also seek mandamus. See All&para;<br>Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. §1651(a); La Buy v. Howes Leather&para;<br>Co., 352 U. S. 249 (1957). Cf. Brock, 476 U. S., at 260, n. 7&para;<br>(noting availability of district court action to compel&para;<br>agency compliance with time-related directive).&para;<br>C&para;<br>Petitioner Dolan, however, believes we have under&para;<br>stated the harm to a defendant that a missed deadline can&para;<br>cause. To show this he makes a three-part argument: (1)&para;<br>A defendant cannot appeal a sentence unless it is part of a&para;<br>“final judgment”; (2) a judgment setting forth a sentence is&para;<br>not “final” until it contains a definitive determination of&para;<br>the amount of restitution; and (3) to delay the determina&para;<br>tion of the amount of restitution beyond the 90-day dead&para;<br>line is to delay the defendant’s ability to appeal for more&para;<br>than 90 days—perhaps to the point where his due process&para;<br>rights are threatened. Brief for Petitioner 28–33.&para;<br>The critical problem with this argument lies in its third&para;<br>step. As we have said, a defendant who, like petitioner&para;<br>here, knows that restitution will be ordered and is aware&para;<br>of the restitution amount prior to the expiration of the 90&para;<br>day deadline can usually avoid additional delay simply by&para;<br>pointing to the statute and asking the court to grant a&para;<br>timely hearing. That did not happen here. And that&para;<br>minimal burden on the defendant is a small cost relative&para;<br>to the prospect of depriving innocent crime victims of their&para;<br>due restitution. (Should the court still refuse, the defen&para;<br>dant could seek mandamus—which we believe will rarely&para;<br>be necessary.)&para;<br>Even in the unlikely instances where that delay does&para;<br>cause the defendant prejudice—perhaps by depriving him&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of evidence to rebut the claimed restitution amount—the&para;<br>defendant remains free to ask the court to take that fact&para;<br>into account upon review. That inquiry might also con&para;<br>sider the reason for the delay and the party responsible for&para;<br>its cause, i.e., whether the Government or the victim. Cf.,&para;<br>e.g., United States v. Stevens, 211 F. 3d 1, 4–6 (CA2 2000)&para;<br>(tolling 90-day deadline for defendant’s bad-faith delay);&para;<br>United States v. Terlingo, 327 F. 3d 216, 218–223 (CA3&para;<br>2003) (same). Adopting the dissent’s approach, by con&para;<br>trast, would permit a defendant’s bad-faith delay to pre&para;<br>vent a timely order of restitution, potentially allowing the&para;<br>defendant to manipulate whether restitution could be&para;<br>awarded at all. But since we are not presented with such&para;<br>a case here, we need not decide whether, or how, such&para;<br>potential harm or equitable considerations should be&para;<br>taken into consideration.&para;<br>In focusing upon the argument’s third step, we do not&para;<br>mean to imply that we accept the second premise, i.e., that&para;<br>a sentencing judgment is not “final” until it contains a&para;<br>definitive determination of the amount of restitution. To&para;<br>the contrary, strong arguments favor the appealability of&para;<br>the initial judgment irrespective of the delay in determin&para;<br>ing the restitution amount. The initial judgment here&para;<br>imposed a sentence of imprisonment and supervised re&para;<br>lease, and stated that restitution would be awarded. This&para;<br>Court has previously said that a judgment that imposes&para;<br>“discipline” may still be “freighted with sufficiently sub&para;<br>stantial indicia of finality to support an appeal.” Corey v.&para;<br>United States, 375 U. S. 169, 174, 175 (1963) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). And the Solicitor General&para;<br>points to statutes that say that a “judgment of conviction”&para;<br>that “includes” a “sentence to imprisonment” is a “final&para;<br>judgment.” 18 U. S. C. §3582(b). So is a judgment that&para;<br>imposes supervised release (which can be imposed only in&para;<br>conjunction with a sentence of imprisonment). Ibid.;&para;<br>§3583(a). So is a judgment that imposes a fine. §3572(c).&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>DOLAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33–34.&para;<br>Moreover, §3664(o) provides that a “sentence that im&para;<br>poses an order of restitution,” such as the later restitution&para;<br>order here, “is a final judgment.” Thus, it is not surprising&para;<br>to find instances where a defendant has appealed from the&para;<br>entry of a judgment containing an initial sentence that&para;<br>includes a term of imprisonment; that same defendant has&para;<br>subsequently appealed from a later order setting forth the&para;<br>final amount of restitution; and the Court of Appeals has&para;<br>consolidated the two appeals and decided them together.&para;<br>See, e.g., United States v. Stevens, supra; United States v.&para;<br>Maung, 267 F. 3d 1113, 1117 (CA11 2001); cf. United&para;<br>States v. Cheal, 389 F. 3d 35, 51–53 (CA1 2004).&para;<br>That the defendant can appeal from the earlier sentenc&para;<br>ing judgment makes sense, for otherwise the statutory 90&para;<br>day restitution deadline, even when complied with, could&para;<br>delay appeals for up to 90 days. Defendants, that is,&para;<br>would be forced to wait three months before seeking re&para;<br>view of their conviction when they could ordinarily do so&para;<br>within 14 days. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(b). Nonethe&para;<br>less, in light of the fact that the interaction of restitution&para;<br>orders with appellate time limits could have consequences&para;<br>extending well beyond cases like the present case (where&para;<br>there was no appeal from the initial conviction and sen&para;<br>tence), we simply note the strength of the arguments&para;<br>militating against the second step of petitioner’s argument&para;<br>without deciding whether or when a party can, or must,&para;<br>appeal. We leave all such matters for another day.&para;<br>The dissent, however, creates a rule that could ad&para;<br>versely affect not just restitution, but other sentencing&para;<br>practices beyond the narrow circumstances presented&para;<br>here. Consider, for example, a judge who (currently lack&para;<br>ing sufficient information) wishes to leave open, say, the&para;<br>amount of a fine, or a special condition of supervised re&para;<br>lease. In the dissent’s view, the entry of any such judg&para;<br>ment would immediately deprive the judge of the author&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ity later to fill in that blank, in the absence of a statute&para;<br>specifically providing otherwise. See post, at 1–4 (opinion&para;<br>of ROBERTS, C. J.). Thus, the sentencing judge would&para;<br>either have to (1) forgo the specific dollar amount or poten&para;<br>tial condition, or (2) wait to enter any judgment until all of&para;<br>the relevant information is at hand. The former alterna&para;<br>tive would sometimes deprive judges of the power to enter&para;<br>components of a sentence they may consider essential.&para;<br>The latter alternative would require the defendant to&para;<br>wait—perhaps months—before taking an appeal.&para;<br>As we have pointed out, our precedents do not currently&para;<br>place the sentencing judge in any such dilemma. See&para;<br>supra, at 5, 8–9. And we need not now depart from those&para;<br>precedents when this case does not require us to do so;&para;<br>when the issue has not been adequately briefed; when the&para;<br>lower court had no opportunity to consider the argument&para;<br>(which the petitioner may well have forfeited); and when&para;<br>the rule would foreclose the current practices of some&para;<br>district courts and unnecessarily cabin the discretion they&para;<br>properly exercise over scheduling and sentencing matters.&para;<br>Cf., e.g., United States v. Stevens, supra, at 3; United&para;<br>States v. Cheal, supra, at 47 (illustrating district court&para;<br>practices).&para;<br>Certainly there is no need to create this rule in the&para;<br>context of restitution, for provisions to which the dissent&para;<br>refers are silent about whether restitution can or cannot&para;<br>be ordered after an initial sentencing. See, e.g., §§3551(b),&para;<br>(c) (“A sanction authorized by [criminal forfeiture and&para;<br>restitution statutes] may be imposed in addition to the&para;<br>[rest of the] sentence”); §3663A(c)(1) (mandatory orders of&para;<br>restitution “shall apply in all sentencing proceedings [for&para;<br>specified offenses]”). And even on the dissent’s theory, the&para;<br>statute elsewhere provides the necessary substantive&para;<br>authorization: “Notwithstanding any other provision of&para;<br>law, when sentencing a defendant convicted of [a specified]&para;<br>offense . . . , the court shall order . . . that the defendant&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>DOLAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>make restitution to the victim of the offense.” §3663A(a)(1)&para;<br>(emphasis added). The dissent cannot explain why a&para;<br>separate statutory provision regarding procedures as to&para;<br>when a “court shall set a date for the final determination&para;<br>of the victim’s losses,” §3664(d)(5), automatically divests a&para;<br>court of this distinct substantive authority. While of&para;<br>course that provision does not “plainly” confer “power to&para;<br>act after sentencing,” post, at 5 (emphasis deleted), neither&para;<br>does it “plainly” remove it or require that all sentencing&para;<br>matters be concluded at one point in time. (And the dis&para;<br>sent’s assertion, see post, at 6—that it uses the term “au&para;<br>thority” not in its “jurisdictional” sense, but rather in the&para;<br>sense that a court lacks “authority” to “impose a sentence&para;<br>above the maximum”—introduces a tenuous analogy that&para;<br>may well confuse this Court’s precedents regarding the&para;<br>term “jurisdictional.” See supra, at 3–4.)&para;<br>In any event, unless one reads the relevant statute’s 90&para;<br>day deadline as an ironclad limit upon the judge’s author&para;<br>ity to make a final determination of the victim’s losses, the&para;<br>statute before us itself provides adequate authority to do&para;<br>what the sentencing judge did here—essentially fill in an&para;<br>amount-related blank in a judgment that made clear that&para;<br>restitution was “applicable.” App. 49 (boldface deleted).&para;<br>Since the sentencing judge’s later order did not “correct”&para;<br>an “error” in the sentence, Rule 35 does not apply. Com&para;<br>pare Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(a) with post, at 2–3. Hence&para;<br>the dissent’s claim that there is no other statute that&para;<br>creates authority (even were we to assume all else in its&para;<br>favor, which we do not) is merely to restate the question&para;<br>posed in this case, not to answer it.&para;<br>Moreover, the dissent’s reading creates a serious statu&para;<br>tory anomaly. It reads the statute as permitting a sen&para;<br>tencing judge to order restitution for a “victim” who “sub&para;<br>sequently discovers further losses” a month, a year, or 10&para;<br>years after entry of the original judgment, while at the&para;<br>same time depriving that judge of the power to award&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>restitution to a victim whose “losses are not ascertainable”&para;<br>within 90 days. Compare §3664(d)(5) (first sentence) with&para;<br>§3664(d)(5) (second sentence). How is that a sensible&para;<br>reading of a statute that makes restitution mandatory for&para;<br>victims?&para;<br>Finally, petitioner asks us to apply the “rule of lenity” in&para;<br>favor of his reading of the statute. Dolan has not provided&para;<br>us with an example of an instance in which the “rule of&para;<br>lenity” has been applied to a statutory time provision in&para;<br>the criminal context. See United States v. Wiltberger, 5&para;<br>Wheat. 76 (1820) (applying rule in interpreting substan&para;<br>tive criminal statute); Bifulco v. United States, 447 U. S.&para;<br>381, 387, 400 (1980) (applying rule in interpreting “penal&para;<br>ties”). But, assuming for argument’s sake that the rule&para;<br>might be so applied, and after considering the statute’s&para;<br>text, structure, and purpose, we nonetheless cannot find a&para;<br>statutory ambiguity sufficiently “grievous” to warrant its&para;<br>application in this case.

S. C. §3664(d)(5). Under the&para;<br>Court’s view, failing to meet the 90-day deadline has no&para;<br>consequence whatever. The Court reads the statute as if&para;<br>it said “the court shall set a date for the final determina&para;<br>tion of the victim’s losses, at any time after sentencing.” I&para;<br>respectfully dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In the absence of §3664(d)(5), any order of restitution&para;<br>must be imposed at sentencing, if it is to be imposed at all.&para;<br>Restitution “may be imposed in addition to [a] sentence” of&para;<br>probation, fine, or imprisonment only if it is authorized&para;<br>under §3556. See §§3551(b)–(c). Section 3556, in turn,&para;<br>authorizes courts to order restitution “in imposing a sen&para;<br>tence on a defendant” (emphasis added), pursuant to yet&para;<br>other provisions requiring such orders to be made “when&para;<br>sentencing a defendant,” §§3663(a)(1)(A), (c)(1), 3663A(a)&para;<br>(1) (emphasis added). The mandatory restitution provi&para;<br>sions of §3663A “apply in all sentencing proceedings for&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>DOLAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

And the court “at the time of sentencing” must&para;<br>“state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the&para;<br>particular sentence”—including its reasons for “not or&para;<br>der[ing] restitution” if it fails to do so. §3553(c).&para;<br>These provisions authorize restitution orders at sentenc&para;<br>ing. They confer no authority to order restitution after&para;<br>sentencing has concluded. When Congress permits courts&para;<br>to impose criminal penalties at some time other than&para;<br>sentencing, it does so explicitly. See, e.g., §3552(b) (provi&para;<br>sional sentence during a study period); §3582(d) (authoriz&para;<br>ing certain penalties “in imposing a sentence . . . or at any&para;<br>time thereafter”); §3583(e) (permitting extension of super&para;<br>vised release); §§4244(d)–(e) (provisional sentencing for&para;<br>the mentally ill); see also Fed.

It permits a trial court to go forward with&para;<br>sentencing while delaying any restitution order for up to&para;<br>90 days.

Dolan was sen&para;<br>tenced on July 30, 2007. The court declined to order resti&para;<br>tution at that time or to set a date for a future restitution&para;<br>order. App. 35, 39–40; see also id., at 49.1 The 90-day&para;<br>period elapsed on October 28. At no time did the Govern&para;<br>ment seek timely relief, whether under Rule 35 or by&para;<br>appeal. Cf.

Nor did it assert any claim that&para;<br>the deadline had been lawfully extended or equitably&para;<br>tolled, an issue that I agree is not before us, see ante, at 3,&para;<br>11. But on April 24, 2008—269 days after sentencing, and&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Whether that date must itself be set at sentencing is not before us.&para;<br>The order setting the date plainly cannot be entered 182 days after&para;<br>sentencing, as happened here.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a, 47a.&para;<br>I cannot see where that court obtained authority to add&para;<br>additional terms to Dolan’s sentence. That is the step the&para;<br>Court misses when it searches for the “remedy” for a&para;<br>violation of §3664(d)(5). Ante, at 1. The rule is that a trial&para;<br>court cannot alter a sentence after the time of sentencing.&para;<br>Section 3664(d)(5) is a limited exception to that rule. If&para;<br>the limits are exceeded the exception does not apply, and&para;<br>the general rule takes over—the sentence cannot be&para;<br>changed to add a restitution provision. Section 3664(d)(5)&para;<br>is self-executing: It grants authority subject to a deadline,&para;<br>and if the deadline is not met, the authority is no longer&para;<br>available.&para;<br>The Court appears to reason that §3664(d)(5) confers the&para;<br>authority to add a restitution provision for at least 90&para;<br>days, and that once the camel’s nose of some permitted&para;<br>delay sneaks under the tent, any further delay is permis&para;<br>sible. Ante, at 3, 5. But that is not what §3664(d)(5) says.&para;<br>It provides 90 days for a final determination of the victims’&para;<br>losses, not a free pass to impose restitution whenever the&para;<br>trial court gets around to it. The court had no more power&para;<br>to order restitution 269 days after sentencing than it did&para;<br>to order an additional term of imprisonment and send&para;<br>Dolan back to prison.&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>To avoid this conclusion, the Court runs through a&para;<br>series of irrelevancies that cannot trump the clear statu&para;<br>tory text. It notes, for example, that §3663A provides that&para;<br>“ ‘[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, when&para;<br>sentencing a defendant convicted of [a specified] offense&para;<br>. . . , the court shall order . . . that the defendant make&para;<br>restitution to the victim of the offense.’ ” Ante, at 6 (quot&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ing §3663A(a)(1); emphasis in Court’s opinion). But the&para;<br>issue before us is when restitution should be ordered, so&para;<br>the language the Court should underscore is “when sen&para;<br>tencing.” This provision plainly confers no power to act&para;<br>after sentencing. Any such power attaches only by virtue&para;<br>of §3663A(d), which incorporates the procedures of §3664,&para;<br>including the limited 90-day exception. See also §3556&para;<br>(“The procedures under section 3664 shall apply to all&para;<br>orders of restitution under this section”).&para;<br>The Court puts greater emphasis on its reading of the&para;<br>statute’s purpose, namely to provide restitution to victims&para;<br>of crime. Certainly that was a purpose Congress sought to&para;<br>promote. But “no legislation pursues its purposes at all&para;<br>costs,” and “it frustrates rather than effectuates legislative&para;<br>intent simplistically to assume that whatever furthers the&para;<br>statute’s primary objective must be the law.” Rodriguez v.&para;<br>United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525–526 (1987) (per curiam).&para;<br>Congress had to balance against the interest in restitu&para;<br>tion the contrary interest in promptly determining the&para;<br>defendant’s sentence. The balance struck was clearly set&para;<br>forth in the statute: determine the victim’s losses by a date&para;<br>“not to exceed 90 days after sentencing.” §3664(d)(5).&para;<br>Whether or not that limit was “primarily designed to help&para;<br>victims of crime,” ante, at 7, it does not cease to be law&para;<br>when invoked by defendants.&para;<br>Nor can the Court find any support in the second sen&para;<br>tence of §3664(d)(5). See ante, at 14–15. That provision&para;<br>addresses a distinct issue—what to do about newly discov&para;<br>ered losses—and sets a higher “good cause” standard. The&para;<br>fact that Congress struck the balance between restitution&para;<br>and finality differently in that context does not justify&para;<br>overriding the balance it struck here.&para;<br>The Court also analogizes the 90-day limit to other&para;<br>provisions discussed in our precedents, most of which have&para;<br>nothing to do with the rights of criminal defendants (for&para;<br>whom procedural protections are of heightened impor&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>DOLAN v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tance), let alone the finality of criminal sentencing. The&para;<br>cited cases are said to establish that an official’s “failure to&para;<br>meet [a] deadline” does not always deprive that official of&para;<br>“power to act beyond it.” Regions Hospital v. Shalala, 522&para;<br>U. S. 448, 459, n. 3 (1998). But the failure to comply with&para;<br>§3664(d)(5) does not deprive anyone of anything: The trial&para;<br>court never had the general authority to alter sentences&para;<br>once imposed, in the way that the administrative agencies&para;<br>in the cited cases were said to have general regulatory&para;<br>authority. The trial court’s authority to add a restitution&para;<br>provision to an otherwise final sentence was conferred by&para;<br>the very provision that limited that authority. Section&para;<br>3664(d)(5) did not take away anything that might persist&para;<br>in the absence of §3664(d)(5).2&para;<br>Even more perplexing is the Court’s suggestion that&para;<br>references to the authority of trial courts necessarily&para;<br>implicate questions of jurisdiction. Ante, at 14. To say&para;<br>that a court lacks authority to order belated restitution&para;<br>does not use “authority” in a jurisdictional sense, see&para;<br>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 511 (2006), but&para;<br>only in the same sense in which a court lacks “authority”&para;<br>to impose a sentence above the statutory maximum. Such&para;<br>action is an error of law, reversible on appeal, but it is not&para;<br>jurisdictional. As in United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v.&para;<br>Espinosa, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9), compli&para;<br>ance with §3664(d)(5) is “not a limitation on the . . . court’s&para;<br>jurisdiction,” but it is a statutory “precondition to obtain&para;<br>ing a [particular] order.” Here that condition was not&para;<br>satisfied.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S. 711 (1990), is equally&para;<br>inapposite: The statute in that case rested the lower court’s authority&para;<br>on whether a bail hearing had been held at all (it had), whereas here&para;<br>the only statutory condition is whether the losses were determined&para;<br>within 90 days of sentencing (they were not).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>&para;<br>In the end, the Court does not appear to need&para;<br>§3664(d)(5) at all. It instead suggests that we abandon&para;<br>the bedrock rules that sentences once imposed are final,&para;<br>and that the only exceptions are ones Congress chooses to&para;<br>allow (and Congress has allowed various ones). The Court&para;<br>instead proposes a judicial power to alter sentences, ap&para;<br>parently at any time. But if a trial court can “leave open,&para;<br>say, the amount of a fine,” ante, at 12, why not, say, the&para;<br>number of years? Thus, after a defendant like Dolan has&para;<br>served his entire sentence—and who knows how long&para;<br>after?—a court might still order additional imprisonment,&para;<br>additional restitution, an additional fine, or an additional&para;<br>condition of supervised release. See ante, at 12–13.&para;<br>The Court cites no authority in support of such “fill in&para;<br>th[e] blank” sentencing, other than two cases implicated in&para;<br>the Circuit split below. Ante, at 13. Prior to the enact&para;<br>ment of §3664(d)(5), however, it was widely recognized&para;<br>that the requirement to impose restitution “when sentenc&para;<br>ing” meant that “[r]estitution must be determined at the&para;<br>time of sentencing,” and could not be left open after sen&para;<br>tencing had concluded.

The limitation of Rule 35(a) to&para;<br>clear errors, corrected within 14 days of sentencing, does&para;<br>not leave trial courts free to make other changes to sen&para;<br>tences whenever they choose.

J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>against a background rule that trial courts cannot change&para;<br>sentences at will.&para;<br>The same is true of §3552(b), which empowers a court&para;<br>that does not wish to delay sentencing but “desires more&para;<br>information than is otherwise available to it” to impose a&para;<br>provisional sentence during a 120-day study period. That&para;<br>statute would be largely unnecessary if a trial court could&para;<br>do the same by order.&para;<br>In Addonizio, 442 U. S., at 189, we thought it noncon&para;<br>troversial that a sentence once imposed is final, subject to&para;<br>such exceptions as Congress has allowed. Contrary to the&para;<br>Court’s suggestion, ante, at 13, Dolan invoked that princi&para;<br>ple both here and below. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 13,&para;<br>15–18, 20, 29, 33, and n. 14, 36, 48, and n. 19; Reply Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 1, 5–8; Appellant’s Opening Brief in No. 08–&para;<br>2104 (CA10), pp. 12–13 (citing United States v. Blackwell,&para;<br>81 F. 3d 945, 949 (CA10 1996), for the proposition that a&para;<br>“district court does not have inherent authority to modify&para;<br>a sentence”). That the Court finds it necessary to question&para;<br>that principle—indeed, to accuse this dissent of “creat[ing]&para;<br>th[e] rule,” ante, at 13—highlights how misguided its&para;<br>decision is.&para;<br>To counter the effects of its opinion and to restore some&para;<br>semblance of finality to sentencing, the Court advises&para;<br>defendants to seek mandamus—a remedy we have de&para;<br>scribed as “drastic and extraordinary,” “reserved for really&para;<br>extraordinary causes,” and one of “the most potent weap&para;<br>ons in the judicial arsenal.” Cheney v. United States Dist.&para;<br>Court for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380 (2004) (internal quota&para;<br>tion marks omitted). What an odd procedure the Court&para;<br>contemplates! A defendant, who should have received a&para;<br>harsher sentence, is to invoke the drastic and extraordi&para;<br>nary remedy of mandamus, to make sure he gets it. That&para;<br>is not how sentencing errors are corrected: If the trial&para;<br>court fails to order the appropriate sentence, the Govern&para;<br>ment must appeal to correct it. It did not do so here, and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>that ends the case. Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 6).&para;<br>Moreover, the Court’s mandamus remedy only helps&para;<br>defendants who know they are in danger of an increased&para;<br>sentence. So the Court imposes another rule, namely that&para;<br>the trial court must explicitly “leave open” the precise&para;<br>sentence at the time of sentencing, ante, at 12, or must&para;<br>make clear, “prior to the deadline’s expiration[,] that it&para;<br>would order restitution” at some indeterminate time, ante,&para;<br>at 1 (emphasis added). But what if the court does not&para;<br>make the crucial announcement at sentencing, or “prior to&para;<br>the deadline’s expiration”? Are these judicially created&para;<br>deadlines to be taken more seriously than those imposed&para;<br>by Congress? Or are we just back at the beginning, asking&para;<br>what the “remedy” should be for failing to meet the rele&para;<br>vant deadline?&para;<br>The Court’s suggestion to require notice of intent to&para;<br>augment the sentence at some future date may be a good&para;<br>idea. But an even better one might be to set a particular&para;<br>date—say, 90 days after sentencing—on which the parties&para;<br>could base their expectations. That was Congress’s choice,&para;<br>and it should be good enough for us.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The District Court in this case failed to order mandatory&para;<br>restitution in sentencing Dolan. That was wrong. But two&para;<br>wrongs do not make a right, and that mistake gave the&para;<br>court no authority to amend Dolan’s sentence later, be&para;<br>yond the 90 days allowed to add a sentencing term requir&para;<br>ing restitution.&para;<br>I am mindful of the fact that when a trial court blun&para;<br>ders, the victims may suffer. Consequences like that are&para;<br>the unavoidable result of having a system of rules.
