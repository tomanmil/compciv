The State imposes sales and use taxes on rail&para;<br>roads when they purchase or consume diesel fuel, but exempts their&para;<br>main competitors—interstate motor and water carriers. CSX sued&para;<br>respondents, the Alabama Department of Revenue and its Commis&para;<br>sioner (Alabama), claiming that this tax scheme discriminates&para;<br>against railroads in violation of the Railroad Revitalization and&para;<br>Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (4–R Act or Act), which bars four&para;<br>forms of discriminatory taxation, 49 U. S. C. §11501(b). Three of the&para;<br>delineated prohibitions deal with property taxes, §§11501(b)(1)–(3),&para;<br>and the fourth is a catch-all provision that forbids a State to&para;<br>“[i]mpose another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier,”&para;<br>§11501(b)(4). The District Court dismissed CSX’s suit as not cogni&para;<br>zable under the 4–R Act on the basis of this Court’s decision in De&para;<br>partment of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332,&para;<br>and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: CSX may challenge Alabama’s sales and use taxes under&para;<br>§11501(b)(4). Pp. 5–19.&para;<br>(a) CSX is challenging “another tax” within subsection (b)(4)’s plain&para;<br>meaning. The Act does not define “tax.” Thus, this Court looks to the&para;<br>word’s ordinary definition, which is expansive. A State seeking to&para;<br>raise revenue may choose among multiple forms of taxation on prop&para;<br>erty, income, transactions, or activities. “[A]nother tax” is thus best&para;<br>understood to encompass any tax a State might impose, on any asset&para;<br>or transaction, except the property taxes already addressed in sub&para;<br>sections (b)(1)–(3). There is no reason to interpret subsection (b)(4)&para;<br>as applying only to the gross-receipts taxes that some States imposed&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF &para;<br>&para;<br>REVENUE&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>in lieu of property taxes at the time of the Act’s passage. Moreover,&para;<br>CSX’s complaint, contrary to the Eleventh Circuit’s apparent view,&para;<br>does protest Alabama’s imposition of taxes on its fuel. The exemp&para;<br>tions the State has given may play a central role in CSX’s argument,&para;<br>but the complaint’s essential subject remains the taxes imposed.&para;<br>The key question thus becomes whether a tax might be said to “dis&para;<br>criminate” against a railroad under subsection (b)(4) where the State&para;<br>has granted exemptions from the tax to other entities (here, the rail&para;<br>road’s competitors). Because the statute does not define “discrimi&para;<br>nates,” the Court again looks to the term’s ordinary meaning, which&para;<br>is to fail to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction&para;<br>can be found between those favored and those not favored. To charge&para;<br>one group of taxpayers a 2% rate and another group a 4% rate, if the&para;<br>groups are the same in all relevant respects, is to discriminate&para;<br>against the latter. That discrimination continues if the favored&para;<br>group’s rate goes down to 0%, which is all an exemption is. To say&para;<br>that such a tax does not “discriminate” is to adopt a definition at odds&para;<br>with the word’s natural meaning. This Court has repeatedly recog&para;<br>nized that tax schemes with exemptions may be discriminatory. See,&para;<br>e.g., Davis v. Michigan Department of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803. And&para;<br>even Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S.&para;<br>332, on which the Eleventh Circuit heavily relied in dismissing CSX’s&para;<br>suit, made clear that tax exemptions “could be a variant of tax dis&para;<br>crimination.” Id., at 343. In addition, the statute’s prohibition of dis&para;<br>crimination applies regardless whether the favored entities are inter&para;<br>state or local. The distinctions drawn in the statute are not between&para;<br>interstate and local actors, as Alabama suggests, but between rail&para;<br>roads and all other actors, whether interstate or local. Pp. 5–10.&para;<br>(b) ACF Industries does not require a different result. There, the&para;<br>Court held that railroads could not contest property tax exemptions&para;<br>under subsection (b)(4), reasoning that it would be illogical to permit&para;<br>such a challenge when subsections (b)(1)–(3)—the §11501 provisions&para;<br>specifically addressing property taxes—permitted States to grant&para;<br>property tax exemptions. Such a reading would “subvert the statu&para;<br>tory plan” and “contravene the ‘elementary canon of construction that&para;<br>a statute should be interpreted so as not to render one part inopera&para;<br>tive.’ ” 510 U. S., at 340. Contrary to Alabama’s argument, this&para;<br>structural analysis does not apply here. Subsections (b)(1)–(3) spe&para;<br>cifically allow property tax exemptions, but neither they nor any&para;<br>other provision of the Act speaks to non-property exemptions like&para;<br>those at issue here. Because Congress has expressed no intent to&para;<br>“allo[w] the States to grant” non-property exemptions, id., at 343,&para;<br>reading subsection (b)(4) to encompass them poses no danger of “nul&para;<br>lify[ing]” a congressional policy choice or otherwise “subverting the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>statutory plan,” id., at 340, 343. Alabama’s other efforts to borrow&para;<br>from ACF Industries’ analysis similarly fail. Also unavailing is Ala&para;<br>bama’s argument that, even if ACF Industries’ reasoning is limited to&para;<br>property tax exemptions, its holding must extend to non-property tax&para;<br>exemptions in order to prevent inconsistent or anomalous results in&para;<br>the treatment of property and non-property taxes.

(CSX) is an inter­&para;<br>state rail carrier that operates in Alabama and pays taxes&para;<br>there. Alabama imposes a sales tax of 4% on the gross&para;<br>receipts of retail businesses, Ala. Code §40–23–2(1) (2010&para;<br>Cum. Supp.), and a use tax of 4% on the storage, use, or&para;<br>consumption of tangible personal property, §40–23–61(a)&para;<br>(2003). Railroads pay these taxes when they purchase or&para;<br>consume diesel fuel. But railroads’ main competitors—&para;<br>interstate motor and water carriers—are generally exempt&para;<br>from paying sales and use taxes on their fuel (although&para;<br>fuel for motor carriers is subject to a separate excise tax).3&para;<br>Alleging that Alabama’s tax scheme discriminates&para;<br>against railroads in violation of §11501(b)(4) of the 4–R&para;<br>Act, CSX sued respondents, the Alabama Department of&para;<br>Revenue and its Commissioner (Alabama or State), in&para;<br>Federal District Court. In particular, CSX complained&para;<br>that the State could not impose sales and use taxes on&para;<br>railroads’ purchase and consumption of diesel fuel while&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The first sentence of subsection (c) provides: “Notwithstanding sec­&para;<br>tion 1341 of title 28 . . . a district court of the United States has&para;<br>jurisdiction . . . to prevent a violation of subsection (b) of this section.”&para;<br>The next sentence concerns the relief available for violations of&para;<br>§§11501(b)(1) and (2): “Relief may be granted under this subsection&para;<br>only if the ratio of assessed value to true market value of rail transpor­&para;<br>tation property exceeds by at least 5 percent the ratio of assessed value&para;<br>to true market value of other commercial and industrial property in the&para;<br>same assessment jurisdiction.”&para;<br>3 State law provides that motor carriers need not pay sales or use&para;<br>taxes on diesel fuel so long as they pay a different excise tax of $0.19&para;<br>per gallon. Ala. Code §40–17–2(1) (2003) (primary tax of $0.13 per&para;<br>gallon); §40–17–220(e) (2010 Cum. Supp.) (additional tax of $0.06 per&para;<br>gallon). State law wholly exempts interstate water carriers from sales&para;<br>and use taxes on diesel fuel. §40–23–4(a)(10); §40–23–62(12). Nor do&para;<br>these water carriers pay any other tax on the fuel they purchase or&para;<br>consume. Brief for Respondents 16.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v.

Appx. 318 (2009). The Elev­&para;<br>enth Circuit rested on its earlier decision in Norfolk&para;<br>Southern R. Co. v. Alabama Dept. of Revenue, 550 F. 3d&para;<br>1306 (2008), which involved a nearly identical challenge to&para;<br>the application of Alabama’s sales and use taxes.&para;<br>In Norfolk Southern, the Eleventh Circuit rejected the&para;<br>plaintiff railroad’s challenge, principally in reliance on this&para;<br>Court’s decision in Department of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF&para;<br>Industries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332 (1994). In that case, we&para;<br>held that a railroad could not invoke §11501(b)(4) to chal­&para;<br>lenge a generally applicable property tax on the basis that&para;<br>certain non-railroad property was exempt from the tax.&para;<br>Id., at 335. The Eleventh Circuit recognized that the case&para;<br>before it involved sales and use taxes—not property taxes,&para;<br>which the statutory scheme separately addresses. Norfolk&para;<br>Southern, 550 F. 3d, at 1314. The court concluded, how­&para;<br>ever, that this difference was immaterial, and accordingly&para;<br>held that a railroad could not object to Alabama’s sales&para;<br>and use taxes simply because the State provides exemp­&para;<br>tions from them. Id., at 1316.&para;<br>CSX petitioned for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the&para;<br>Eleventh Circuit had misunderstood ACF Industries and&para;<br>noting a split of authority concerning whether railroads&para;<br>may bring a challenge under §11501(b)(4) to non-property&para;<br>taxes from which their competitors are exempt.4 We&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Compare Norfolk Southern R.

To&para;<br>determine whether this suit may go forward, we must&para;<br>therefore answer two questions. Is CSX challenging “an­&para;<br>other tax” within the meaning of the statute? And, if so,&para;<br>might that tax “discriminate” against rail carriers by&para;<br>exempting their competitors?5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>ton No. R. Co. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 606 N.

W.&para;<br>2d 338, 348 (Iowa 1983) (same).&para;<br>5 We consider here only questions relating to whether CSX can bring&para;<br>a claim for discrimination based on the State’s pattern of tax exemp­&para;<br>tions. We do not consider any issues concerning whether these exemp­&para;<br>tions actually discriminate against CSX. See infra, at 18–19, and n. 8.&para;<br>Alabama has raised two such issues in this Court. First, Alabama&para;<br>contends that in deciding CSX’s claim, a federal court must consider&para;<br>not only the specific taxes challenged, but also the broader tax scheme.&para;<br>Brief for Respondents 58–60. Second, the State argues that the court&para;<br>must compare the taxation of CSX not merely to direct competitors&para;<br>but to other commercial entities as well. Id., at 48, n. 7. Most of the&para;<br>dissenting opinion is devoted to supporting the State’s argument on&para;<br>this second question. But we leave these and all other issues relating&para;<br>to whether Alabama actually has discriminated against CSX to the&para;<br>trial court on remand to address as and when it wishes. No court in&para;<br>this case has previously considered these questions, and the parties’&para;<br>briefs in this Court have only sketchily addressed them. In addition,&para;<br>the parties dispute whether Alabama waived its claim on the second&para;<br>issue by initially agreeing that “the comparison class consists of motor&para;<br>carriers and water carriers,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a (internal quota­&para;<br>tion marks omitted), and proceeding with the litigation on that basis.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v.

In these circumstances, we look to the word’s&para;<br>ordinary definition, Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513&para;<br>U. S. 179, 187 (1995), and we note what taxpayers have&para;<br>long since discovered—that the meaning of “tax” is expan­&para;<br>sive. A State (or other governmental entity) seeking to&para;<br>raise revenue may choose among multiple forms of taxa­&para;<br>tion on property, income, transactions, or activities.&para;<br>“[A]nother tax,” as used in subsection (b)(4), is best under­&para;<br>stood to refer to all of these—more precisely, to encompass&para;<br>any form of tax a State might impose, on any asset or&para;<br>transaction, except the taxes on property previously ad­&para;<br>dressed in subsections (b)(1)–(3). See Burlington Northern&para;<br>R. Co. v.

The phrase&para;<br>“another tax” is a catch-all.&para;<br>In particular, we see no reason to interpret subsection&para;<br>(b)(4) as applying only to the gross-receipts taxes—known&para;<br>as “in lieu” taxes—that some States imposed instead of&para;<br>property taxes at the time of the Act’s passage. See Brief&para;<br>for Respondents 53–55; Brief for State of Washington&para;<br>et al. as Amici Curiae 20–22.

The substitution of “another&para;<br>tax” occurred when Congress first recodified the Act. In line with&para;<br>Congress’s statement that revisions made at that time should not be&para;<br>construed as having substantive effect, see n. 1, supra, we treat the two&para;<br>terms as synonymous.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

But the Conference Report&para;<br>on the final bill abandoned the House Report’s narrowing&para;<br>language and described the subsection as it was written—&para;<br>as prohibiting, without limitation, “the imposition of any&para;<br>other tax which results in the discriminatory treatment of&para;<br>any” railroad. S. Conf. Rep. No. 94–595, pp. 165–166&para;<br>(1976); accord, S. Rep. No. 94–499, p. 65 (1975). And the&para;<br>statutory language is the real crux of the matter: Subsec­&para;<br>tion (b)(4) speaks both clearly and broadly, and a legisla­&para;<br>tive report misdescribing the provision cannot succeed in&para;<br>altering it.7&para;<br>Nor do we agree with the Eleventh Circuit’s apparent&para;<br>view that CSX does not challenge “another tax” because its&para;<br>complaint relies on the exemptions the State has given.&para;<br>See Norfolk Southern, 550 F. 3d, at 1315 (“The language of&para;<br>section (b)(4) prohibits a discriminatory ‘tax’ not a dis­&para;<br>criminatory tax exemption”); Brief for American Trucking&para;<br>Assns., Inc. as Amicus Curiae 9. What the complaint&para;<br>protests is Alabama’s imposition of taxes on the fuel CSX&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 Alabama also invokes the remedial provision of subsection (c), n. 2,&para;<br>supra, to urge that we read §11501 as effectively limited to property or&para;<br>“in lieu” taxes. According to Alabama, that provision entitles federal&para;<br>courts to grant relief only when States overvalue railroad property&para;<br>under subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2): Federal courts, the State avers,&para;<br>“have no power to enjoin the granting of tax exemptions as a violation&para;<br>of subsection (b)(4), or, apparently [to remedy] any violation of subsection (b)(4).” Brief for Respondents 37. But that interpretation of&para;<br>subsection (c)’s remedial provision cannot be right, because it would&para;<br>nullify subsection (b)(4) (and, for that matter, subsection (b)(3) as well).&para;<br>We understand subsection (c)’s remedial provision neither as limiting&para;<br>the broad grant of jurisdiction to federal courts to prevent violations of&para;<br>subsection (b) nor as otherwise restricting the scope of that subsection.&para;<br>The remedial provision simply limits the availability of relief when a&para;<br>State discriminates in assessing the value of railroad property, as&para;<br>proscribed by subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2). That kind of discrimination&para;<br>is not at issue here.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT.

App. 23. The exemptions,&para;<br>no doubt, play a central role in CSX’s argument: They&para;<br>demonstrate, in CSX’s view, that the State’s sales and use&para;<br>taxes discriminate against railroads. See id., at 22, ¶¶24–&para;<br>26. But the essential subject of the complaint remains the&para;<br>taxes Alabama levies on CSX.&para;<br>The key question thus becomes whether a tax might be&para;<br>said to “discriminate” against a railroad under subsection&para;<br>(b)(4) because the State has granted exemptions from the&para;<br>tax to other entities (here, the railroad’s competitors). The&para;<br>statute does not define “discriminates,” and so we again&para;<br>look to the ordinary meaning of the word. See supra, at 5.&para;<br>“Discrimination” is the “failure to treat all persons equally&para;<br>when no reasonable distinction can be found between&para;<br>those favored and those not favored.” Black’s Law Dic­&para;<br>tionary 534 (9th ed. 2009); accord, id., at 420 (5th ed.&para;<br>1979); see also Webster’s Third New International Dic­&para;<br>tionary 648 (1976) (“discriminates” means “to make a&para;<br>difference in treatment or favor on a class or categorical&para;<br>basis in disregard of individual merit”). To charge one&para;<br>group of taxpayers a 2% rate and another group a 4%&para;<br>rate, if the groups are the same in all relevant respects,&para;<br>is to discriminate against the latter. That discrimination&para;<br>continues (indeed, it increases) if the State takes the&para;<br>favored group’s rate down to 0%. And that is all an ex­&para;<br>emption is. See West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512&para;<br>U. S. 186, 210–211 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg­&para;<br>ment) (noting that an “ ‘exemption’ from . . . a ‘neutral’ tax”&para;<br>for favored persons “is no different in principle” than “a&para;<br>discriminatory tax . . . imposing a higher liability” on&para;<br>disfavored persons). To say that such a tax (with such an&para;<br>exemption) does not “discriminate”—assuming the groups&para;<br>are similarly situated and there is no justification for the&para;<br>difference in treatment—is to adopt a definition of the&para;<br>term at odds with its natural meaning.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

In Davis v. Michigan Dept. of&para;<br>Treasury, 489 U. S. 803 (1989), for example, we reviewed a&para;<br>state income tax provision that exempted retirement&para;<br>benefits given by the State, but not those paid by the&para;<br>Federal Government. We held that the tax “discrimi­&para;<br>nate[d]” against federal employees under 4 U. S. C. §111,&para;<br>which serves to protect those employees from discrimina­&para;<br>tory state taxation. Similarly, our dormant Commerce&para;<br>Clause cases have often held that tax exemptions given to&para;<br>local businesses discriminate against interstate actors.&para;<br>See, e.g., Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263,&para;<br>268–269 (1984) (holding that a state excise tax on alcohol&para;<br>“discriminate[d]” against interstate businesses because of&para;<br>exemptions granted to local producers); Camps New­&para;<br>found/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U.

And even our decision in ACF Industries,&para;<br>on which the Eleventh Circuit relied in dismissing CSX’s&para;<br>suit, made clear that tax exemptions “could be a variant of&para;<br>tax discrimination.” 510 U.

The distinctions drawn in §11501(b) are&para;<br>not between interstate and local actors, as the State con­&para;<br>tends, but rather between railroads and other actors,&para;<br>whether interstate or local. Accordingly, a state excise tax&para;<br>that applies to railroads but exempts their interstate&para;<br>competitors is subject to challenge under subsection (b)(4)&para;<br>as a “tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.”8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 This conclusion does not, as Alabama and the dissent contend, turn&para;<br>railroads into “most-favored-taxpayers,” entitled to any exemption (or&para;<br>other tax break) that a State gives to another entity. See Brief for&para;<br>Respondents 23; post, at 9 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). We hold only that&para;<br>§11501(b)(4) enables a railroad to challenge an excise or other non­&para;<br>property tax as discriminatory on the basis of the tax scheme’s exemp­&para;<br>tions—as the dissent apparently agrees, post, at 1. Whether the&para;<br>railroad will prevail—that is, whether it can prove the alleged dis­&para;<br>crimination—depends on whether the State offers a sufficient justifica­&para;<br>tion for declining to provide the exemption at issue to rail carriers. See&para;<br>supra, at 8; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25–26; Richmond,&para;<br>F. &amp; P. R. Co. v. Department of Taxation, Commonwealth of Va., 762&para;<br>F. 2d 375, 380–381, and n. 4 (CA4 1985). So if, to use the dissent’s&para;<br>example, a railroad challenged a scheme in which “every person and&para;<br>business in the State of Alabama paid a $1 annual tax, and one person&para;<br>was exempt,” post, at 9, for some reason having nothing to do with&para;<br>railroads, we presume the suit would be promptly dismissed. Nothing&para;<br>in this application of §11501(b)(4) offers a “windfall” to railroads. Ibid.&para;<br>The dissent argues in addition that a State should prevail against&para;<br>any claim of discrimination brought under subsection (b)(4) if it can&para;<br>demonstrate that a tax does not “target” or “single out” a railroad, post,&para;<br>at 1; that showing, without more, would justify the tax (although the&para;<br>dissent declines to say just what it means to “target,” post, at 7, n. 3).&para;<br>This argument primarily concerns the question whether Alabama’s tax&para;<br>scheme in fact discriminates under subsection (b)(4)—a question we&para;<br>have explained is inappropriate to address, see n. 5, supra. We note,&para;<br>however, that the dissent’s argument about subsection (b)(4) rests&para;<br>entirely on the premise that subsections (b)(1)–(3) prohibit only prop­&para;<br>erty taxes that “target” or “single out” railroads, see post, at 4; so, the&para;<br>dissent would say, a State may impose a 4% property tax on railroads&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>III&para;<br>As against the plain language of subsection (b)(4), Ala­&para;<br>bama offers two arguments based on our decision in ACF&para;<br>Industries. The first claim, which the Eleventh Circuit&para;<br>accepted, rests on the reasoning we adopted in ACF Indus­&para;<br>tries: We concluded there that railroads could not chal­&para;<br>lenge property tax exemptions under subsection (b)(4),&para;<br>and Alabama asserts that the same analysis applies to excise (and other non-property) tax exemptions. The second&para;<br>contention focuses on alleged problems that would emerge&para;<br>in the application of §11501(b) if the rule of ACF Indus­&para;<br>tries did not govern all tax exemptions. On this view, even&para;<br>if ACF Industries’ reasoning is irrelevant to cases involv­&para;<br>ing excise taxes, its holding must extend to those cases to&para;<br>prevent inconsistent or anomalous results. We reject each&para;<br>of these arguments. We stand foursquare behind our&para;<br>decision in ACF Industries, but we will not extend it in the&para;<br>way the State wishes.&para;<br>A&para;<br>In ACF Industries, we considered whether a railroad&para;<br>could sue a State under subsection (b)(4) for taxing rail­&para;<br>road property while exempting certain other commercial&para;<br>property. We held that the railroad could not do so. We&para;<br>noted that the language of subsection (b)(4), when viewed&para;<br>in isolation, could be read to allow such a challenge. But&para;<br>we reasoned that the structure of §11501 required the&para;<br>opposite result. 510 U. S., at 343. The Eleventh Circuit&para;<br>——————&para;<br>(assuming some unspecified number of other taxpayers also pay that&para;<br>rate) while levying only a 2% property tax on railroad competitors. But&para;<br>we have never decided, in ACF Industries or any other case, whether&para;<br>subsections (b)(1)–(3) should be interpreted in this manner. And even&para;<br>accepting the dissent’s unexplained premise, a serious question would&para;<br>remain about whether to transplant this construction of subsections&para;<br>(b)(1)–(3) to subsection (b)(4)’s very different terrain, see infra, at 16–&para;<br>18.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF &para;<br>&para;<br>REVENUE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>considered ACF Industries “determinative” of the question&para;<br>here, Norfolk Southern, 550 F. 3d, at 1313, and Alabama&para;<br>agrees, Brief for Respondents 18. We think they misread&para;<br>that decision.&para;<br>We began our analysis in ACF Industries by explaining&para;<br>that railroads could not challenge property tax exemptions&para;<br>under subsections (b)(1)–(3)—the provisions of §11501&para;<br>specifically addressing property taxes. As noted earlier,&para;<br>subsections (b)(1)–(3) prohibit a State from imposing&para;<br>higher property tax rates or assessment ratios on “rail&para;<br>transportation property” than on “other commercial and&para;<br>industrial property.” The statute defines “commercial and&para;<br>industrial property” as including only “property . . . subject&para;<br>to a property tax levy.” §11501(a)(4). We interpreted that&para;<br>phrase to mean “property that is taxed,” rather than&para;<br>property that is potentially taxable. 510 U. S., at 341–342.&para;<br>As a result, we determined that exempt (i.e., non-taxed)&para;<br>property fell outside the category of “other commercial and&para;<br>industrial property” against which the taxation of railroad&para;<br>property is measured. Ibid. The conclusion followed:&para;<br>Subsections (b)(1)–(3) permitted States to impose property&para;<br>taxes on railroads while exempting other entities. Ibid.&para;<br>And because that was so, we stated, still another con­&para;<br>clusion followed: Subsection (b)(4)’s prohibition on dis­&para;<br>crimination likewise could not encompass property tax&para;<br>exemptions. Id., at 343. We viewed this holding as a&para;<br>matter of simple deduction: “It would be illogical to con­&para;<br>clude that Congress, having allowed the States to grant&para;<br>property tax exemptions in subsections (b)(1)–(3), would&para;<br>turn around and nullify its own choice in subsection&para;<br>(b)(4).” Ibid. Or stated otherwise: “[R]eading subsection&para;<br>(b)(4) to prohibit what” other parts of the statute were&para;<br>“designed to allow,” would “subvert the statutory plan”&para;<br>and “contravene the ‘elementary canon of construction&para;<br>that a statute should be interpreted so as not to render&para;<br>one part inoperative.’ ” Id., at 340. The structure of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§11501 thus compelled our conclusion that property tax&para;<br>exemptions—even if “a variant of tax discrimination,” id.,&para;<br>at 343—fell outside subsection (b)(4)’s reach.&para;<br>But this structural analysis—the core of ACF Indus­&para;<br>tries—has no bearing on the question here. Subsections&para;<br>(b)(1)–(3) specifically address—and allow—property tax&para;<br>exemptions. But neither those subsections nor any other&para;<br>provision of the 4–R Act speaks to non-property tax ex­&para;<br>emptions like those at issue in this case. Congress has&para;<br>expressed no intent to “allo[w] the States to grant” these&para;<br>exemptions. Ibid. Reading subsection (b)(4) as written—&para;<br>to encompass non-property tax exemptions—therefore&para;<br>poses no danger of “nullify[ing]” a congressional policy&para;<br>choice or otherwise “subvert[ing] the statutory plan.” Id.,&para;<br>at 340, 343. To the contrary: Giving subsection (b)(4)&para;<br>something other than its ordinary meaning, absent any&para;<br>structural reason to do so, would itself contravene the&para;<br>expressed will of Congress.&para;<br>Implicitly acknowledging that ACF Industries’ central&para;<br>theory is irrelevant here, Alabama focuses on what that&para;<br>decision called “[o]ther considerations reinforc[ing]” its&para;<br>structural analysis. Id., at 343. Most notably, Alabama&para;<br>underscores the following sentence from ACF Industries:&para;<br>“Given the prevalence of property tax exemptions when&para;<br>Congress enacted the 4–R Act, [§11501’s] silence on the&para;<br>subject—in light of the explicit prohibition of tax rate and&para;<br>assessment ratio discrimination—reflects a determination&para;<br>to permit the States to leave their exemptions in place.”&para;<br>Id., at 344. Alabama asserts that this statement “holds&para;<br>just as true” for sales and use taxes. Brief for Respon­&para;<br>dents 41.&para;<br>That claim rings hollow. To be sure, ACF Industries&para;<br>noted that Congress had declined to speak “with any&para;<br>degree of particularity to” the permissibility of property&para;<br>tax exemptions, even though States often granted them.&para;<br>510 U. S., at 343. But we thought that fact relevant only&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF &para;<br>&para;<br>REVENUE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>because Congress had spoken with particularity in pro­&para;<br>scribing other forms of discriminatory property taxes. The&para;<br>very sentence Alabama highlights makes our reasoning&para;<br>clear: Congress’s silence as to the practice of granting&para;<br>property tax exemptions reflected its acquiescence in that&para;<br>practice “in light of the explicit prohibition [in subsections&para;<br>(b)(1)–(3)] of [property] tax rate and assessment ratio&para;<br>discrimination.” Id., at 344 (emphasis added). If that&para;<br>explicit prohibition had not existed—if §11501(b) had&para;<br>consisted only of subsection (b)(4)’s broad ban on tax&para;<br>discrimination—we could not have gleaned what we did&para;<br>from congressional silence. After all, the very purpose of a&para;<br>catch-all provision like subsection (b)(4) is to avoid the&para;<br>necessity of listing each matter (here, each kind of tax&para;<br>discrimination) falling within it. And with respect to non­&para;<br>property taxes (like Alabama’s sales and use taxes), sub­&para;<br>section (b)(4) is all there is. So here again, our analysis in&para;<br>ACF Industries does not apply because it rested on subsec­&para;<br>tions (b)(1)–(3)—that is, on the highly reticulated scheme&para;<br>in the 4–R Act relating solely to property taxes.&para;<br>Alabama also emphasizes our statement in ACF Indus­&para;<br>tries that “ ‘[p]rinciples of federalism’ ” supported our hold­&para;<br>ing, Brief for Respondents 41–43 (quoting 510 U. S., at&para;<br>345), but this final effort to borrow from that decision’s&para;<br>analysis similarly fails. We indeed recognized in ACF&para;<br>Industries that the 4–R Act limits the traditional taxing&para;<br>power of the States. Because that is so, we expressed&para;<br>“hesitan[ce] to extend the statute beyond its evident&para;<br>scope.” 510 U. S., at 345. But here, for all the reasons&para;<br>already noted, we are not “extend[ing] the statute”; we are&para;<br>merely giving effect to its clear meaning. To reiterate: The&para;<br>4–R Act distinguishes between property taxes and other&para;<br>taxes. Congress expressed its intent to insulate property&para;<br>tax exemptions from challenge; against that background,&para;<br>ACF Industries stated that permitting such suits would&para;<br>intrude on the States’ rightful authority. By contrast,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress drafted §11501 to enable railroads to contest all&para;<br>other tax exemptions; and when Congress speaks in such&para;<br>preemptive terms, its decision must govern. Principles of&para;<br>federalism cannot narrow §11501’s clear scope. See, e.g.,&para;<br>CSX Transp., Inc. v. Georgia State Bd. of Equalization,&para;<br>552 U. S. 9, 20 (2007) (rejecting the idea that federalism&para;<br>principles preclude challenges to state valuation method­&para;<br>ologies when §11501 “clearly authorized” such actions).&para;<br>Nothing in ACF Industries suggested otherwise.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Alabama additionally makes a subtler argument involv­&para;<br>ing ACF Industries. Given that decision, Alabama con­&para;<br>tends, a ruling in CSX’s favor here would create troubling&para;<br>inconsistencies. Alabama claims that subsection (b)(4)’s&para;<br>singular prohibition on “discriminat[ion]” would then&para;<br>mean one thing for property taxes (according to ACF&para;<br>Industries) and another for non-property taxes, even&para;<br>though nothing in the statute supports “morphing defini­&para;<br>tions.” Brief for Respondents 32. And still worse than the&para;<br>difference in meaning would be the difference in result:&para;<br>A ruling for CSX, Alabama argues, would give railroads&para;<br>more protection against non-property taxes than against&para;<br>property taxes, even though no good reason exists for this&para;<br>distinction.&para;<br>Alabama’s one-word-two-meanings argument collapses&para;<br>because it again rests on a misunderstanding of ACF&para;<br>Industries. That decision did not define “discriminat[e]” or&para;<br>say that a tax exemption could not fall within that term.&para;<br>Quite to the contrary: As noted earlier, ACF Industries&para;<br>frankly acknowledged that tax exemptions, including&para;<br>property tax exemptions, “could be a variant of tax dis­&para;<br>crimination.” 510 U. S., at 343; supra, at 9. We held that&para;<br>property tax exemptions were immune from challenge&para;<br>under subsection (b)(4) for structural, rather than linguis­&para;<br>tic, reasons. Even assuming these exemptions “discrimi­&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF &para;<br>&para;<br>REVENUE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>nate[d],” they did so in a way that the specific provisions of&para;<br>§§11501(b)(1)–(3) allow, and accordingly §11501(b)(4)’s&para;<br>prohibition could not include them. That reasoning, once&para;<br>more, does not apply here, because subsections (b)(1)–(3)&para;<br>do not permit—indeed, in no way address—non-property&para;<br>tax exemptions. We therefore do not adopt a new defini­&para;<br>tion of “discriminate” in this case; in the context of the 4–R&para;<br>Act, that word has, and has always had, just one meaning.&para;<br>What remains is Alabama’s complaint that a ruling in&para;<br>CSX’s favor, when combined with our decision in ACF&para;<br>Industries, will result in divergent treatment of property&para;<br>and non-property taxes. At times, Alabama dresses up&para;<br>this objection in Latin: It contends that the canon of ejus­&para;<br>dem generis, which “limits general terms [that] follow&para;<br>specific ones to matters similar to those specified,” Gooch&para;<br>v. United States, 297 U. S. 124, 128 (1936), has a role to&para;<br>play in interpreting §11501(b). More particularly, Ala­&para;<br>bama contends that this canon supports reading into&para;<br>§11501(b)(4) every limitation contained in §§11501(b)(1)–&para;<br>(3), including the exclusion of tax exemptions from the&para;<br>class of state actions subject to challenge. See Brief for&para;<br>Respondents 26–27. That interpretive move, Alabama&para;<br>rightly notes, would ensure equal treatment of property&para;<br>tax and non-property tax exemptions.&para;<br>But we think ejusdem generis is not relevant here. As&para;<br>an initial matter, subsection (b)(4), “[a]lthough something&para;<br>of a catchall, . . . is not a general or collective term follow­&para;<br>ing a list of specific items to which a particular statutory&para;<br>command is applicable (e.g., ‘fishing rods, nets, hooks,&para;<br>bobbers, sinkers, and other equipment’).” United States v.&para;<br>Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, 615 (1995) (SCALIA, J., concurring&para;<br>in part and dissenting in part). Rather, that subsection is&para;<br>“one of . . . several distinct and independent prohibitions.”&para;<br>Ibid. Related to this structural point is a functional one.&para;<br>We typically use ejusdem generis to ensure that a general&para;<br>word will not render specific words meaningless. E.g.,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 114–115&para;<br>(2001); see 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and&para;<br>Statutory Construction §47:17 (7th ed. 2007). But that&para;<br>concern is absent here. Reading subsection (b)(4) to cover&para;<br>non-property tax exemptions will not deprive subsections&para;<br>(b)(1)–(3) of effect, because those subsections are ad­&para;<br>dressed only to property taxes. A canon meaning literally&para;<br>“of the same kind” has no application to provisions di­&para;<br>rected toward dissimilar subject matter.&para;<br>The better version of Alabama’s claim reads entirely in&para;<br>English; it is simply that distinguishing between property&para;<br>tax exemptions and other tax exemptions makes not a&para;<br>whit of sense. We are not much inclined to disagree.&para;<br>Neither CSX nor the United States as amicus curiae has&para;<br>offered a satisfying reason for why Congress drew this&para;<br>line—why in §§11501(b)(1)–(3) it barred challenges based&para;<br>on property tax exemptions, but then turned around in&para;<br>§11501(b)(4) to allow challenges based on, say, excise tax&para;<br>exemptions. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4–5, 24–25. CSX, for&para;<br>example, has not presented any evidence that different tax&para;<br>exemptions posed different levels of threat to railroads’&para;<br>financial stability. So even if Congress had a good reason&para;<br>for distinguishing between property and non-property tax&para;<br>exemptions, we acknowledge that it eludes us.&para;<br>But this admission does not take us far in Alabama’s&para;<br>direction. Even if the 4–R Act were ambiguous, we doubt&para;<br>we would interpret subsection (b)(4) to replicate each facet&para;<br>of subsections (b)(1)–(3). Treating property tax exemp­&para;<br>tions and other tax exemptions equivalently might make&para;<br>sense, as Alabama argues. But so too might allowing&para;<br>railroads to challenge all taxes (property or non-property)&para;<br>that contain exemptions. After all, as we noted earlier,&para;<br>tax exemptions are an obvious form of tax discrimination.&para;<br>See supra, at 8–9. It is hardly self-evident why Congress&para;<br>would prohibit a State from charging a railroad a 4% tax&para;<br>and a competitor a 2% tax, but allow the State to charge&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC. v. ALABAMA DEPT. OF &para;<br>&para;<br>REVENUE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>the railroad a 4% tax and the competitor nothing. The&para;<br>latter situation would frustrate the purposes of the Act&para;<br>even more than the former. In ACF Industries, we ac­&para;<br>cepted that anomaly because the terms and structure of&para;<br>the Act demanded that we do so. But we could say no&para;<br>more in favor of the result than that it was “not so bizarre&para;<br>that Congress could not have intended it.” 510 U. S., at&para;<br>347 (internal quotation marks omitted). That was not a&para;<br>glowing recommendation, and we see no reason today to&para;<br>view the matter differently. Accordingly, even assuming&para;<br>that statutory ambiguity permitted us to do so, we would&para;<br>hesitate to extend the distinction between tax exemptions&para;<br>and differential tax rates in order to avoid a distinction&para;<br>between property and non-property taxes. That would&para;<br>seem a poor trade of statutory anomalies.&para;<br>In any event, and more importantly, the choice is not&para;<br>ours to make. Congress wrote the statute it wrote, and&para;<br>that statute draws a sharp line between property taxes&para;<br>and other taxes. Congress drafted §§11501(b)(1)–(3) to&para;<br>exclude tax exemptions from the sphere of prohibited&para;<br>property tax discrimination. But it drafted §11501(b)(4)&para;<br>more broadly, without any of the prior subsections’ limita­&para;<br>tions, to proscribe other “tax[es] that discriminat[e],”&para;<br>including through the use of exemptions. That congres­&para;<br>sional election settles this case. Alabama’s preference for&para;<br>symmetry cannot trump an asymmetrical statute. And its&para;<br>preference for the greatest possible latitude to levy taxes&para;<br>cannot trump Congress’s decision to restrict discrimina­&para;<br>tory taxation of rail carriers.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Our decision in this case is limited. We hold that CSX&para;<br>may challenge Alabama’s sales and use taxes as “tax[es]&para;<br>that discriminat[e] against . . . rail carrier[s]” under&para;<br>§11501(b)(4).
