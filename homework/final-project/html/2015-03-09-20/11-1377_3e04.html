EDDIE LEE &para;<br>&para;<br>HOWARD ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME &para;<br>&para;<br>COURT OF OKLAHOMA&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 11–1377. Decided November 26, 2012&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>State courts rather than federal courts are most fre­&para;<br>quently called upon to apply the Federal Arbitration Act&para;<br>(FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq., including the Act’s national&para;<br>policy favoring arbitration. It is a matter of great im­&para;<br>portance, therefore, that state supreme courts adhere to a&para;<br>correct interpretation of the legislation. Here, the Okla­&para;<br>homa Supreme Court failed to do so. By declaring the&para;<br>noncompetition agreements in two employment contracts&para;<br>null and void, rather than leaving that determination to&para;<br>the arbitrator in the first instance, the state court ignored&para;<br>a basic tenet of the Act’s substantive arbitration law. The&para;<br>decision must be vacated.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>This dispute arises from a contract between petitioner&para;<br>Nitro-Lift Technologies, L. L. C., and two of its former&para;<br>employees. Nitro-Lift contracts with operators of oil and&para;<br>gas wells to provide services that enhance production.&para;<br>Respondents Eddie Lee Howard and Shane D. Schneider&para;<br>entered a confidentiality and noncompetition agreement&para;<br>with Nitro-Lift that contained the following arbitration&para;<br>clause:&para;<br>“ ‘Any dispute, difference or unresolved question be­&para;<br>tween Nitro-Lift and the Employee (collectively the&para;<br>“Disputing Parties”) shall be settled by arbitration by&para;<br>a single arbitrator mutually agreeable to the Disput­&para;<br>ing Parties in an arbitration proceeding conducted in&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NITRO-LIFT TECHNOLOGIES, L. L. C. v. HOWARD&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Houston, Texas in accordance with the rules existing&para;<br>at the date hereof of the American Arbitration Associ­&para;<br>ation.’ ” Pet. for Cert. 5.&para;<br>After working for Nitro-Lift on wells in Oklahoma, Texas,&para;<br>and Arkansas, respondents quit and began working for&para;<br>one of Nitro-Lift’s competitors. Claiming that respondents&para;<br>had breached their noncompetition agreements, Nitro-Lift&para;<br>served them with a demand for arbitration. Respondents&para;<br>then filed suit in the District Court of Johnston County,&para;<br>Oklahoma, asking the court to declare the noncompetition&para;<br>agreements null and void and to enjoin their enforcement.&para;<br>The court dismissed the complaint, finding that the con­&para;<br>tracts contained valid arbitration clauses under which an&para;<br>arbitrator, and not the court, must settle the parties’&para;<br>disagreement.&para;<br>The Oklahoma Supreme Court retained respondents’&para;<br>appeal and ordered the parties to show cause why the&para;<br>matter should not be resolved by application of Okla.&para;<br>Stat., Tit. 15, §219A (West 2011), which limits the en­&para;<br>forceability of noncompetition agreements.&para;<br>Nitro-Lift&para;<br>argued that any dispute as to the contracts’ enforceability&para;<br>was a question for the arbitrator. It relied for support—&para;<br>as it had done before the trial court—upon several of this&para;<br>Court’s cases interpreting the FAA, and noted that under&para;<br>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440,&para;<br>446 (2006), “this arbitration law applies in both state and&para;<br>federal courts.” Record in No. 109,003 (Okla.), p. 273.&para;<br>The Oklahoma Supreme Court was not persuaded. It&para;<br>held that despite the “[U. S.] Supreme Court cases on&para;<br>which the employers rely,” the “existence of an arbitration&para;<br>agreement in an employment contract does not prohibit&para;<br>judicial review of the underlying agreement.” 2011 OK 98,&para;<br>¶15, n. 20, ¶16, 273 P. 3d 20, 26, n. 20, 27. For that prop­&para;<br>osition, the court relied on the “exhaustive overview of&para;<br>the United States Supreme Court decisions construing the&para;<br>Federal Arbitration Act” in Bruner v. Timberlane Manor&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Ltd. Partnership, 2006 OK 90, 155 P. 3d 16, which found&para;<br>Supreme Court jurisprudence “not to inhibit our review&para;<br>of the underlying contract’s validity.” 273 P. 3d, at 26.&para;<br>Finding the arbitration clauses no obstacle to its review,&para;<br>the court held that the noncompetition agreements were&para;<br>“void and unenforceable as against Oklahoma’s public&para;<br>policy,” expressed in Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, §219A. 273 P. 3d,&para;<br>at 27.&para;<br>The Oklahoma Supreme Court declared that its decision&para;<br>rests on adequate and independent state grounds. Id., at&para;<br>23–24, n. 5. If that were so, we would have no jurisdiction&para;<br>over this case. See Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032,&para;<br>1037–1044 (1983). It is not so, however, because the&para;<br>court’s reliance on Oklahoma law was not “independent”—&para;<br>it necessarily depended upon a rejection of the federal&para;<br>claim, which was both “ ‘properly presented to’ ” and “ ‘ad­&para;<br>dressed by’ ” the state court. Howell v. Mississippi, 543&para;<br>U. S. 440, 443 (2005) (per curiam) (quoting Adams v.&para;<br>Robertson, 520 U. S. 83, 86 (1997) (per curiam)). NitroLift claimed that the arbitrator should decide the con­&para;<br>tract’s validity, and raised a federal-law basis for that&para;<br>claim by relying on Supreme Court cases construing the&para;<br>FAA. “ ‘[A] litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can&para;<br>easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a&para;<br>state-court petition or brief . . . by citing in conjunction&para;<br>with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies&para;<br>or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds . . . .’ ”&para;<br>Howell, supra, at 444 (quoting Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U. S.&para;<br>27, 32 (2004); emphasis added). The Oklahoma Supreme&para;<br>Court acknowledged the cases on which Nitro-Lift relied,&para;<br>as well as their relevant holdings, but chose to discount&para;<br>these controlling decisions. Its conclusion that, despite&para;<br>this Court’s jurisprudence, the underlying contract’s valid­&para;<br>ity is purely a matter of state law for state-court deter­&para;<br>mination is all the more reason for this Court to assert&para;<br>jurisdiction.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>NITRO-LIFT TECHNOLOGIES, L. L. C. v. HOWARD&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>The Oklahoma Supreme Court’s decision disregards this&para;<br>Court’s precedents on the FAA. That Act, which “de­&para;<br>clare[s] a national policy favoring arbitration,” Southland&para;<br>Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 10 (1984), provides that a&para;<br>“written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transac­&para;<br>tion involving commerce to settle by arbitration a contro­&para;<br>versy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction&para;<br>. . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon&para;<br>such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation&para;<br>of any contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2. It is well settled that&para;<br>“the substantive law the Act created [is] applicable in state&para;<br>and federal courts.” Southland Corp., supra, at 12; see&para;<br>also Buckeye, supra, at 446. And when parties commit to&para;<br>arbitrate contractual disputes, it is a mainstay of the Act’s&para;<br>substantive law that attacks on the validity of the con­&para;<br>tract, as distinct from attacks on the validity of the arbi­&para;<br>tration clause itself, are to be resolved “by the arbitrator&para;<br>in the first instance, not by a federal or state court.”&para;<br>Preston v. Ferrer, 552 U. S. 346, 349 (2008); see also Prima&para;<br>Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395&para;<br>(1967). For these purposes, an “arbitration provision is&para;<br>severable from the remainder of the contract,” Buckeye,&para;<br>supra, at 445, and its validity is subject to initial court&para;<br>determination; but the validity of the remainder of the&para;<br>contract (if the arbitration provision is valid) is for the&para;<br>arbitrator to decide.&para;<br>This principle requires that the decision below be va­&para;<br>cated. The trial court found that the contract contained a&para;<br>valid arbitration clause, and the Oklahoma Supreme&para;<br>Court did not hold otherwise. It nonetheless assumed the&para;<br>arbitrator’s role by declaring the noncompetition agree­&para;<br>ments null and void. The state court insisted that its&para;<br>“[own] jurisprudence controls this issue” and permits&para;<br>review of a “contract submitted to arbitration where one&para;<br>party assert[s] that the underlying agreement [is] void and&para;<br>unenforceable.” 273 P. 3d, at 26. But the Oklahoma&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Supreme Court must abide by the FAA, which is “the&para;<br>supreme Law of the Land,” U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, and&para;<br>by the opinions of this Court interpreting that law. “It&para;<br>is this Court’s responsibility to say what a statute means,&para;<br>and once the Court has spoken, it is the duty of other&para;<br>courts to respect that understanding of the governing rule&para;<br>of law.” Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U. S. 298,&para;<br>312 (1994). Our cases hold that the FAA forecloses pre­&para;<br>cisely this type of “judicial hostility towards arbitration.”&para;<br>AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2011) (slip op., at 8).&para;<br>The state court reasoned that Oklahoma’s statute “ad­&para;<br>dressing the validity of covenants not to compete, must&para;<br>govern over the more general statute favoring arbitration.”&para;<br>273 P. 3d, at 26, n. 21. But the ancient interpretive prin­&para;<br>ciple that the specific governs the general (generalia specialibus non derogant) applies only to conflict between&para;<br>laws of equivalent dignity. Where a specific statute, for&para;<br>example, conflicts with a general constitutional provision,&para;<br>the latter governs. And the same is true where a specific&para;<br>state statute conflicts with a general federal statute.&para;<br>There is no general-specific exception to the Supremacy&para;<br>Clause, U. S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 2. “ ‘[W]hen state law&para;<br>prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of&para;<br>claim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule&para;<br>is displaced by the FAA.’ ” Marmet Health Care Center,&para;<br>Inc. v. Brown, 565 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2012) (per curiam)&para;<br>(slip op., at 3–4) (quoting AT&amp;T Mobility LLC, supra, at&para;<br>___–___ (slip op., at 6–7)). Hence, it is for the arbitrator to&para;<br>decide in the first instance whether the covenants not to&para;<br>compete are valid as a matter of applicable state law. See&para;<br>Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 445–446.&para;<br>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for certiorari is&para;<br>granted. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklaho­&para;<br>ma is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings&para;<br>not inconsistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
