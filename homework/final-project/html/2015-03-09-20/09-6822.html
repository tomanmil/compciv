UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–6822. Argued December 6, 2010—Decided March 2, 2011&para;<br>After pleading guilty to drug charges, petitioner Pepper was sentenced&para;<br>under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to 24 months’ imprison&para;<br>ment, a nearly 75 percent downward departure from the low end of&para;<br>the Guidelines range based in part on his substantial assistance, fol&para;<br>lowed by five years of supervised release. In Pepper I, the Eighth&para;<br>Circuit reversed and remanded for resentencing in light of, inter alia,&para;<br>United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220. Pepper, who had begun serv&para;<br>ing his supervised release, testified at his resentencing hearing that&para;<br>he was no longer a drug addict, having completed a 500-hour drug&para;<br>treatment program while in prison; that he was enrolled in commu&para;<br>nity college and had achieved very good grades; and that he was&para;<br>working part time. Pepper’s father testified that he and his son were&para;<br>no longer estranged, and Pepper’s probation officer testified that a&para;<br>24-month sentence would be reasonable in light of Pepper’s substan&para;<br>tial assistance, postsentencing rehabilitation, and demonstrated low&para;<br>recidivism risk. The District Court again sentenced Pepper to 24&para;<br>months, granting a 40 percent downward departure based on Pep&para;<br>per’s substantial assistance and a further downward variance based&para;<br>on, inter alia, Pepper’s rehabilitation since his initial sentencing. In&para;<br>Pepper II, the Eighth Circuit again reversed and remanded for resen&para;<br>tencing, concluding that Pepper’s postsentencing rehabilitation could&para;<br>not be considered as a factor supporting a downward variance, and&para;<br>directing that the case be assigned to a different district judge. After&para;<br>this Court vacated and remanded the Pepper II judgment in light of&para;<br>Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, the Eighth Circuit, in Pepper III,&para;<br>reversed and remanded once more. At the second resentencing hear&para;<br>ing, Pepper informed the new district judge that he was still in&para;<br>school, was about to be promoted at his job, and had married and was&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PEPPER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>supporting his new family. Noting the nearly identical remand lan&para;<br>guage of Pepper II and Pepper III, the court observed that it was not&para;<br>bound to reduce Pepper’s range by 40 percent for substantial assis&para;<br>tance. Instead, it found him entitled to a 20 percent reduction and&para;<br>refused to grant a further downward variance for, inter alia, postsen&para;<br>tencing rehabilitation. It imposed a 65-month prison term and 12&para;<br>months of supervised release. In Pepper IV, the Eighth Circuit once&para;<br>again rejected Pepper’s postsentencing rehabilitation argument. It&para;<br>also rejected his claim that the law of the case from Pepper II and&para;<br>Pepper III required the District Court to reduce the applicable Guide&para;<br>lines range by at least 40 percent.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. When a defendant’s sentence has been set aside on appeal, a dis&para;<br>trict court at resentencing may consider evidence of the defendant’s&para;<br>postsentencing rehabilitation, and such evidence may, in appropriate&para;<br>cases, support a downward variance from the now-advisory Guide&para;<br>lines range. Pp. 9–27.&para;<br>(a) Consistent with the principle that “the punishment should fit&para;<br>the offender and not merely the crime,” Williams v. New York, 337&para;<br>U. S. 241, 247, this Court has observed a consistent and uniform pol&para;<br>icy “under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion&para;<br>in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determin&para;<br>ing the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits&para;<br>fixed by law,” id., at 246, particularly “the fullest information possi&para;<br>ble concerning the defendant’s life and characteristics,” id., at 247.&para;<br>That principle is codified at 18 U. S. C. §3661, which provides that&para;<br>“[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information” a sentencing court&para;<br>may consider “concerning the [defendant’s] background, character,&para;<br>and conduct,” and at §3553(a), which specifies that sentencing courts&para;<br>must consider, among other things, a defendant’s “history and char&para;<br>acteristics,” §3553(a)(1). The Guidelines, which Booker made “effec&para;<br>tively advisory,” 543 U. S., at 245, “should be the starting point and&para;<br>the initial benchmark,” but district courts may impose sentences&para;<br>within statutory limits based on appropriate consideration of all of&para;<br>the §3553(a) factors, subject to appellate review for “reasonableness,”&para;<br>Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49–51. This sentencing frame&para;<br>work applies both at initial sentencing and at any subsequent resen&para;<br>tencing after a sentence has been set aside on appeal. Pp. 9–12.&para;<br>(b) Postsentencing rehabilitation evidence may support a down&para;<br>ward variance from the advisory Guidelines range. The plain lan&para;<br>guage of §3661 makes clear that there is “[n]o limitation . . . on . . .&para;<br>background, character, and conduct” information, and it makes no&para;<br>distinction between an initial sentencing and a subsequent resen&para;<br>tencing. In addition, postsentencing rehabilitation evidence may be&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>highly relevant to several §3553(a) factors that district courts are re&para;<br>quired to consider at sentencing. The extensive evidence of Pepper’s&para;<br>rehabilitation since his initial sentencing is clearly relevant to the se&para;<br>lection of an appropriate sentence here. Most fundamentally, that&para;<br>evidence provides the most up-to-date picture of his “history and&para;<br>characteristics.” §3553(a)(1). At the time of his initial sentencing, he&para;<br>was an unemployed drug addict who was estranged from his family&para;<br>and sold drugs. By his second resentencing, he had been drug-free&para;<br>for nearly five years, was attending college, was a top employee&para;<br>slated for promotion, had re-established a relationship with his fa&para;<br>ther, and was married and supporting a family. His postsentencing&para;<br>conduct also sheds light on the likelihood that he will engage in fu&para;<br>ture criminal conduct, a central factor that sentencing courts must&para;<br>consider. See §§3553(a)(2)(B)–(C). Pp. 12–15.&para;<br>(c) The contrary arguments advanced by amicus appointed to de&para;<br>fend the judgment are unpersuasive. Pp. 15–26.&para;<br>(1) While §3742(g)(2)—which prohibits a district court at re&para;<br>sentencing from imposing a sentence outside the Guidelines range&para;<br>except upon a ground it relied upon at the prior sentencing—&para;<br>effectively precludes a court from considering postsentencing reha&para;<br>bilitation, that provision is invalid after Booker. Like the provisions&para;<br>invalidated in Booker—§§3553(b)(1) and 3742(e)—§3742(g)(2) re&para;<br>quires district courts effectively to treat the Guidelines as mandatory&para;<br>in an entire set of cases. Thus, the proper remedy is to invalidate the&para;<br>provision. While applying §3742(g)(2) at resentencing would not al&para;<br>ways result in a Sixth Amendment violation, this Court rejects a par&para;<br>tial invalidation that would leave the Guidelines effectively manda&para;<br>tory in some cases and advisory in others. The fact that §3742(g)(2)&para;<br>permits a resentencing court on remand to impose a non-Guidelines&para;<br>sentence where the prior sentence expressly relied on a departure&para;<br>upheld by the court of appeals also does not cure the constitutional&para;<br>infirmity. And the argument that any constitutional infirmity in&para;<br>§3742(g)(2) can be remedied by invalidating §3742(j)(1)(B) is rejected.&para;<br>Pp. 15–20.&para;<br>(2) This Court finds unpersuasive amicus’ arguments focusing&para;<br>on Congress’ sentencing objectives under §3553(a). Contrary to&para;<br>amicus’ contention, §3742(g)(2) does not reflect a congressional pur&para;<br>pose to preclude consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation evi&para;<br>dence. Thus, that provision has no bearing on this Court’s analysis of&para;<br>whether §3553(a) permits consideration of such evidence. Nor is the&para;<br>consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation inconsistent with the&para;<br>sentencing factor in §3553(a)(5)—which directs sentencing courts to&para;<br>consider “any pertinent policy statement” of the Sentencing Commis&para;<br>sion—particularly as the pertinent policy statement in this case is&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PEPPER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>based on unconvincing policy rationales not reflected in the relevant&para;<br>sentencing statutes. Consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation&para;<br>is also not inconsistent with §3553(a)(6)—which requires courts to&para;<br>consider “the need to avoid unwarranted sentenc[ing] disparities&para;<br>among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of&para;<br>similar conduct”—as any disparity arises only from the normal trial&para;<br>and sentencing process. The differences in procedural opportunity&para;<br>that may result because some defendants are inevitably sentenced in&para;<br>error and must be resentenced are not the kinds of “unwarranted”&para;<br>sentencing disparities that Congress sought to eliminate under&para;<br>§3553(a)(6). Pp. 21–26.&para;<br>(d) On remand, the District Court should consider and give ap&para;<br>propriate weight to the postsentencing rehabilitation evidence, as&para;<br>well as any additional evidence concerning Pepper’s conduct since his&para;<br>last sentencing. Pp. 26–27.&para;<br>2. Because the Eighth Circuit in Pepper III set aside Pepper’s en&para;<br>tire sentence and remanded for de novo resentencing, the District&para;<br>Court was not bound by the law of the case doctrine to apply the&para;<br>same 40 percent departure applied by the original sentencing judge.&para;<br>To avoid undermining a district court’s original sentencing intent, an&para;<br>appellate court when reversing one part of a sentence “may vacate&para;<br>the entire sentence . . . so that, on remand, the trial court can recon&para;<br>figure the sentencing plan . . . to satisfy [§3553(a)’s] sentencing fac&para;<br>tors.” Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S. 237, 253. That is what&para;<br>the Eighth Circuit did here.

New York, 337 U. S. 241, 246–247&para;<br>(1949). Congress codified this principle at 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§3661, which provides that “[n]o limitation shall be placed&para;<br>on the information” a sentencing court may consider “con&para;<br>cerning the [defendant’s] background, character, and con&para;<br>duct,” and at §3553(a), which sets forth certain factors&para;<br>that sentencing courts must consider, including “the his&para;<br>tory and characteristics of the defendant,” §3553(a)(1).&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit&para;<br>concluded in this case that the District Court, when resen&para;<br>tencing petitioner after his initial sentence had been set&para;<br>aside on appeal, could not consider evidence of petitioner’s&para;<br>rehabilitation since his initial sentencing. That conclusion&para;<br>conflicts with longstanding principles of federal sentenc&para;<br>ing law and Congress’ express directives in §§3661 and&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PEPPER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>3553(a).&para;<br>Although a separate statutory provision,&para;<br>§3742(g)(2), prohibits a district court at resentencing from&para;<br>imposing a sentence outside the Federal Sentencing&para;<br>Guidelines range except upon a ground it relied upon at&para;<br>the prior sentencing—thus effectively precluding the court&para;<br>from considering postsentencing rehabilitation for pur&para;<br>poses of imposing a non-Guidelines sentence—that provi&para;<br>sion did not survive our holding in United States v.&para;<br>Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), and we expressly invalidate&para;<br>it today.&para;<br>We hold that when a defendant’s sentence has been set&para;<br>aside on appeal, a district court at resentencing may&para;<br>consider evidence of the defendant’s postsentencing reha&para;<br>bilitation and that such evidence may, in appropriate&para;<br>cases, support a downward variance from the now&para;<br>advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Sepa&para;<br>rately, we affirm the Court of Appeals’ ruling that the law&para;<br>of the case doctrine did not require the District Court in&para;<br>this case to apply the same percentage departure from the&para;<br>Guidelines range for substantial assistance that had been&para;<br>applied at petitioner’s prior sentencing.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In October 2003, petitioner Jason Pepper was arrested&para;<br>and charged with conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or&para;<br>more of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.

Pepper’s&para;<br>sentencing range under the Guidelines was 97 to 121&para;<br>months.1 The Government moved for a downward depar&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Although the charge to which Pepper pleaded guilty carried a man&para;<br>datory minimum of 120 months’ imprisonment, the mandatory mini&para;<br>mum did not apply because he was eligible for safety-valve relief&para;<br>pursuant to 18 U. S. C. §3553(f) (2000 ed.) and §5C1.2 of the United&para;<br>States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (Nov. 2003) (USSG).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

The Government appealed Pepper’s&para;<br>sentence, and in June 2005, the Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded for resentencing in&para;<br>light of our intervening decision in Booker (and for another&para;<br>reason not relevant here). See United States v. Pepper,&para;<br>412 F. 3d 995, 999 (2005) (Pepper I). Pepper completed his&para;<br>24-month sentence three days after Pepper I was issued&para;<br>and began serving his term of supervised release.&para;<br>In May 2006, the District Court conducted a resentenc&para;<br>ing hearing and heard from three witnesses. In his testi&para;<br>mony, Pepper first recounted that while he had previously&para;<br>been a drug addict, he successfully completed a 500-hour&para;<br>drug treatment program while in prison and he no longer&para;<br>used any drugs. App. 104–105. Pepper then explained&para;<br>that since his release from prison, he had enrolled at a&para;<br>local community college as a full-time student and had&para;<br>earned A’s in all of his classes in the prior semester. Id.,&para;<br>at 106–107. Pepper also testified that he had obtained&para;<br>employment within a few weeks after being released from&para;<br>custody and was continuing to work part-time while at&para;<br>tending school. Id., at 106–110. Pepper confirmed that he&para;<br>was in compliance with all the conditions of his supervised&para;<br>release and described his changed attitude since his ar&para;<br>rest.

Id., at 117. Pepper’s drug treatment program,&para;<br>according to his father, “truly sobered him up” and “made&para;<br>his way of thinking change.” Id., at 121. He explained&para;<br>that Pepper was now “much more mature” and “serious in&para;<br>terms of planning for the future,” id., at 119, and that as a&para;<br>consequence, he had re-established a relationship with his&para;<br>son, id., at 118–119.&para;<br>Finally, Pepper’s probation officer testified that, in his&para;<br>view, a 24-month sentence would be reasonable in light of&para;<br>Pepper’s substantial assistance, postsentencing rehabilita&para;<br>tion, and demonstrated low risk of recidivism. Id., at 126–&para;<br>131. The probation officer also prepared a sentencing&para;<br>memorandum that further set forth the reasons support&para;<br>ing his recommendation for a 24-month sentence.&para;<br>The District Court adopted as its findings of fact the&para;<br>testimony of the three witnesses and the probation offi&para;<br>cer’s sentencing memorandum. The court granted a 40&para;<br>percent downward departure based on Pepper’s substan&para;<br>tial assistance, reducing the bottom of the Guidelines&para;<br>range from 97 to 58 months. The court then granted a&para;<br>further 59 percent downward variance based on, inter alia,&para;<br>Pepper’s rehabilitation since his initial sentencing. Id., at&para;<br>143–148.3 The court sentenced Pepper to 24 months of&para;<br>imprisonment, concluding that “it would [not] advance any&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The court also cited Pepper’s lack of a violent history and, to a lesser&para;<br>extent, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparity with&para;<br>Pepper’s co-conspirators.

See United States v. Pepper, 486 F. 3d 408,&para;<br>410, 413 (CA8 2007) (Pepper II). The court concluded that,&para;<br>while it was “a close call, [it could not] say the district&para;<br>court abused its discretion” by granting the 40 percent&para;<br>downward departure for substantial assistance. Id., at&para;<br>411. The court found the further 59 percent downward&para;<br>variance, however, to be an abuse of discretion. Id., at&para;<br>412–413. In doing so, the court held that Pepper’s “post&para;<br>sentencing rehabilitation was an impermissible factor to&para;<br>consider in granting a downward variance.” Id., at 413.&para;<br>The court stated that evidence of postsentencing reha&para;<br>bilitation “ ‘is not relevant and will not be permitted at&para;<br>resentencing because the district court could not have&para;<br>considered that evidence at the time of the original&para;<br>sentencing,’ ” and permitting courts to consider post&para;<br>sentencing rehabilitation at resentencing “would create&para;<br>unwarranted sentencing disparities and inject blatant&para;<br>inequities into the sentencing process.” Ibid.4 The Court&para;<br>of Appeals directed that the case be assigned to a different&para;<br>district judge for resentencing. Ibid.&para;<br>After the Court of Appeals’ mandate issued, Pepper’s&para;<br>case was reassigned on remand to Chief Judge Linda R.&para;<br>Reade.

In&para;<br>the meantime, Pepper petitioned this Court for a writ of&para;<br>certiorari, and in January 2008, we granted the petition,&para;<br>vacated the judgment in Pepper II, and remanded the case&para;<br>to the Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of&para;<br>Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38 (2007). See Pepper v.&para;<br>United States, 552 U. S. 1089 (2008).&para;<br>On remand, the Court of Appeals held that Gall did not&para;<br>alter its prior conclusion that “post-sentence rehabilitation&para;<br>is an impermissible factor to consider in granting a down&para;<br>ward variance.” 518 F. 3d 949, 953 (CA8 2008) (Pepper&para;<br>III). The court again reversed the sentence and remanded&para;<br>for resentencing.&para;<br>In October 2008, Chief Judge Reade convened Pepper’s&para;<br>second resentencing hearing. Pepper informed the court&para;<br>that he was still attending school and was now working as&para;<br>a supervisor for the night crew at a warehouse retailer,&para;<br>where he was recently selected by management as “associ&para;<br>ate of the year” and was likely to be promoted the follow&para;<br>ing January. App. 320, 323. Pepper also stated that he&para;<br>had recently married and was now supporting his wife and&para;<br>her daughter. Id., at 321. Pepper’s father reiterated that&para;<br>Pepper was moving forward in both his career and his&para;<br>family life and that he remained in close touch with&para;<br>his son. See id., at 300–304.&para;<br>In December 2008, Chief Judge Reade issued a sentenc&para;<br>ing memorandum. Noting that the remand language of&para;<br>Pepper III was nearly identical to the language in Pepper&para;<br>II, the court again observed that it was “not bound to&para;<br>reduce [Pepper’s] advisory Sentencing Guidelines range by&para;<br>40%” for substantial assistance and concluded that Pepper&para;<br>was entitled only to a 20 percent downward departure&para;<br>because the assistance was “timely, helpful and impor&para;<br>tant” but “in no way extraordinary.” Sealed Sentencing&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

The court also granted the Government’s motion&para;<br>under Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce&para;<br>dure to account for investigative assistance Pepper pro&para;<br>vided after he was initially sentenced.

Id., at 963–964.&para;<br>We granted Pepper’s petition for a writ of certiorari, 561&para;<br>U.

Section 3577 (1970 ed.) provided:&para;<br>“No limitation shall be placed on the information con&para;<br>cerning the background, character, and conduct of a&para;<br>person convicted of an offense which a court of the&para;<br>United States may receive and consider for the pur&para;<br>pose of imposing an appropriate sentence.” (Emphasis&para;<br>added.)&para;<br>In the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA), 18 U.

In&para;<br>doing so, however, Congress recodified §3577 without&para;<br>change at §3661. The Sentencing Commission, moreover,&para;<br>expressly incorporated §3661 in the Guidelines:&para;<br>“In determining the sentence to impose within the&para;<br>guideline range, or whether a departure from the&para;<br>guidelines is warranted, the court may consider, with&para;<br>out limitation, any information concerning the back&para;<br>ground, character and conduct of the defendant,&para;<br>unless otherwise prohibited by law.

S. 85, 101 (2007) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, although the&para;<br>“Guidelines should be the starting point and the initial&para;<br>benchmark,” district courts may impose sentences within&para;<br>statutory limits based on appropriate consideration of all&para;<br>of the factors listed in §3553(a), subject to appellate review&para;<br>for “reasonableness.” Gall, 552 U.

Leung, 40 F. 3d&para;<br>577, 586 (CA2 1994) (“A defendant’s race or nationality may play no&para;<br>adverse role in the administration of justice, including at sentencing”).&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>PEPPER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sentencing framework applies both at a defendant’s initial&para;<br>sentencing and at any subsequent resentencing after a&para;<br>sentence has been set aside on appeal. See 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§3742(g) (“A district court to which a case is remanded . . .&para;<br>shall resentence a defendant in accordance with section&para;<br>3553”); see also Dillon v.

C. §3582(c)(2),&para;<br>which “do not implicate the interests identified in Booker,”&para;<br>and “plenary resentencing proceedings,” which do).&para;<br>B&para;<br>In light of the federal sentencing framework described&para;<br>above, we think it clear that when a defendant’s sentence&para;<br>has been set aside on appeal and his case remanded for&para;<br>resentencing, a district court may consider evidence of a&para;<br>defendant’s rehabilitation since his prior sentencing and&para;<br>that such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a&para;<br>downward variance from the advisory Guidelines range.&para;<br>Preliminarily, Congress could not have been clearer in&para;<br>directing that “[n]o limitation . . . be placed on the infor&para;<br>mation concerning the background, character, and con&para;<br>duct” of a defendant that a district court may “receive and&para;<br>consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sen&para;<br>tence.” 18 U. S. C. §3661. The plain language of §3661&para;<br>makes no distinction between a defendant’s initial sen&para;<br>tencing and a subsequent resentencing after a prior sen&para;<br>tence has been set aside on appeal.

S., at 152. A categorical bar on the consid&para;<br>eration of postsentencing rehabilitation evidence would&para;<br>directly contravene Congress’ expressed intent in §3661.&para;<br>In addition, evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation&para;<br>may be highly relevant to several of the §3553(a) factors&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that Congress has expressly instructed district courts to&para;<br>consider at sentencing. For example, evidence of postsen&para;<br>tencing rehabilitation may plainly be relevant to “the&para;<br>history and characteristics of the defendant.” §3553(a)(1).&para;<br>Such evidence may also be pertinent to “the need for the&para;<br>sentence imposed” to serve the general purposes of sen&para;<br>tencing set forth in §3553(a)(2)—in particular, to “afford&para;<br>adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,” “protect the&para;<br>public from further crimes of the defendant,” and “provide&para;<br>the defendant with needed educational or vocational train&para;<br>ing . . . or other correctional treatment in the most ef&para;<br>fective manner.” §§3553(a)(2)(B)–(D); see McMannus, 496&para;<br>F. 3d, at 853 (Melloy, J., concurring) (“In assessing . . .&para;<br>deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation, 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §3553(a)(2)(B)(C) &amp; (D), there would seem to be no&para;<br>better evidence than a defendant’s post-incarceration&para;<br>conduct”). Postsentencing rehabilitation may also criti&para;<br>cally inform a sentencing judge’s overarching duty under&para;<br>§3553(a) to “impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater&para;<br>than necessary” to comply with the sentencing purposes&para;<br>set forth in §3553(a)(2).&para;<br>As the original sentencing judge recognized, the exten&para;<br>sive evidence of Pepper’s rehabilitation since his initial&para;<br>sentencing is clearly relevant to the selection of an appro&para;<br>priate sentence in this case. Most fundamentally, evi&para;<br>dence of Pepper’s conduct since his release from custody in&para;<br>June 2005 provides the most up-to-date picture of Pepper’s&para;<br>“history and characteristics.” §3553(a)(1); see United&para;<br>States v. Bryson, 229 F. 3d 425, 426 (CA2 2000) (“[A]&para;<br>court’s duty is always to sentence the defendant as he&para;<br>stands before the court on the day of sentencing”). At the&para;<br>time of his initial sentencing in 2004, Pepper was a 25&para;<br>year-old drug addict who was unemployed, estranged from&para;<br>his family, and had recently sold drugs as part of a&para;<br>methamphetamine conspiracy. By the time of his second&para;<br>resentencing in 2009, Pepper had been drug-free for&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>PEPPER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>nearly five years, had attended college and achieved high&para;<br>grades, was a top employee at his job slated for a promo&para;<br>tion, had re-established a relationship with his father, and&para;<br>was married and supporting his wife’s daughter. There is&para;<br>no question that this evidence of Pepper’s conduct since&para;<br>his initial sentencing constitutes a critical part of the&para;<br>“history and characteristics” of a defendant that Congress&para;<br>intended sentencing courts to consider. §3553(a).&para;<br>Pepper’s postsentencing conduct also sheds light on the&para;<br>likelihood that he will engage in future criminal conduct, a&para;<br>central factor that district courts must assess when impos&para;<br>ing sentence. See §§3553(a)(2)(B)–(C); Gall, 552 U. S., at&para;<br>59 (“Gall’s self-motivated rehabilitation . . . lends strong&para;<br>support to the conclusion that imprisonment was not&para;<br>necessary to deter Gall from engaging in future criminal&para;<br>conduct or to protect the public from his future criminal&para;<br>acts” (citing §§3553(a)(2)(B)–(C))). As recognized by Pep&para;<br>per’s probation officer, Pepper’s steady employment, as&para;<br>well as his successful completion of a 500-hour drug&para;<br>treatment program and his drug-free condition, also&para;<br>suggest a diminished need for “educational or vocational training . . . or other correctional treatment.”&para;<br>§3553(a)(2)(D). Finally, Pepper’s exemplary postsentenc&para;<br>ing conduct may be taken as the most accurate indicator of&para;<br>“his present purposes and tendencies and significantly to&para;<br>suggest the period of restraint and the kind of discipline&para;<br>that ought to be imposed upon him.” Ashe, 302 U. S., at&para;<br>55. Accordingly, evidence of Pepper’s postsentencing&para;<br>rehabilitation bears directly on the District Court’s over&para;<br>arching duty to “impose a sentence sufficient, but not&para;<br>greater than necessary” to serve the purposes of sentenc&para;<br>ing. §3553(a).&para;<br>In sum, the Court of Appeals’ ruling prohibiting the&para;<br>District Court from considering any evidence of Pepper’s&para;<br>postsentencing rehabilitation at resentencing conflicts&para;<br>with longstanding principles of federal sentencing law and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>contravenes Congress’ directives in §§3661 and 3553(a).&para;<br>C&para;<br>Amicus nevertheless advances two principal arguments&para;<br>in defense of the Court of Appeals’ ruling: (1) 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§3742(g)(2), which restricts the discretion of a resentenc&para;<br>ing court on remand to impose a non-Guidelines sentence,&para;<br>effectively forecloses consideration of a defendant’s post&para;<br>sentencing rehabilitation; and (2) permitting district&para;<br>courts to consider postsentencing rehabilitation would&para;<br>defeat Congress’ objectives under §3553(a). We are not&para;<br>persuaded.&para;<br>1&para;<br>Amicus’ main argument relies on 18 U. S. C. §3742(g)(2),&para;<br>a provision that the Court of Appeals did not cite below.&para;<br>That provision states that when a sentence is set aside on&para;<br>appeal, the district court to which the case is remanded:&para;<br>“shall not impose a sentence outside the applicable&para;<br>guidelines range except upon a ground that—&para;<br>“(A) was specifically and affirmatively included in&para;<br>the written statement of reasons required by section&para;<br>3553(c) in connection with the previous sentencing of&para;<br>the defendant prior to the appeal; and&para;<br>“(B) was held by the court of appeals, in remanding&para;<br>the case, to be a permissible ground of departure.”&para;<br>In operation, §3742(g)(2) restricts the discretion of a dis&para;<br>trict court on remand by precluding the court from impos&para;<br>ing a sentence outside the Guidelines range except upon a&para;<br>“ground of departure” that was expressly relied upon in&para;<br>the prior sentencing and upheld on appeal. Amicus thus&para;<br>correctly contends that, on its face, §3742(g)(2) effectively&para;<br>forecloses a resentencing court from considering evidence&para;<br>of a defendant’s postsentencing rehabilitation for purposes&para;<br>of imposing a non-Guidelines sentence because, as a prac&para;<br>tical matter, such evidence did not exist at the time of the&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>PEPPER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>prior sentencing. As the Government concedes, however,&para;<br>§3742(g)(2) is invalid after Booker.&para;<br>As we have explained, Booker held that where judicial&para;<br>factfinding increases a defendant’s applicable Sentencing&para;<br>Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory in&para;<br>those circumstances would violate the defendant’s Sixth&para;<br>Amendment right to be tried by a jury and to have every&para;<br>element of an offense proved by the Government beyond a&para;<br>reasonable doubt. See supra, at 11. We recognized in&para;<br>Booker that, although the SRA permitted departures from&para;<br>the applicable Guidelines range in limited circumstances,9&para;<br>“departures are not available in every case, and in fact are&para;<br>unavailable in most.” 543 U. S., at 234. Because in those&para;<br>instances, “the judge is bound to impose a sentence within&para;<br>the Guidelines range,” we concluded that the availability&para;<br>of departures in certain circumstances “does not avoid the&para;<br>constitutional issue.” Ibid.&para;<br>To remedy the constitutional problem, we rendered the&para;<br>Guidelines effectively advisory by invalidating two provi&para;<br>sions of the SRA: 18 U. S. C. §3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp.&para;<br>IV), which generally required sentencing courts to impose&para;<br>a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range, and&para;<br>§3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which prescribed the&para;<br>standard of appellate review, including de novo review of&para;<br>Guidelines departures. 543 U. S., at 259. We invalidated&para;<br>these provisions even though we recognized that manda&para;<br>tory application of the Guidelines would not always result&para;<br>in a Sixth Amendment violation.10 Indeed, although the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 See&para;<br>&para;<br>18 U.

But, as explained&para;<br>above, that possibility was equally true with respect to the&para;<br>sentencing provisions we invalidated in Booker. See su&para;<br>pra, at 16. As with those provisions, “we cannot assume&para;<br>that Congress, if faced with the statute’s invalidity in key&para;<br>applications, would have preferred to apply the statute in&para;<br>as many other instances as possible.” 543 U.

Brief for Amicus Curiae in Sup&para;<br>port of Judgment Below 21–22. Section 3742(j)(1)(B)&para;<br>provides that a “ground of departure” is “permissible” for&para;<br>purposes of §3742(g)(2)(B) only if it is, inter alia, “author&para;<br>ized under section 3553(b).” In Booker, we noted that&para;<br>“statutory cross-references” to the SRA provisions we&para;<br>invalidated were also constitutionally infirm. 543 U. S., at&para;<br>259. Because §3742(j)(1)(B) incorporates a cross-reference&para;<br>to §3553(b)(1), one of the provisions we invalidated in&para;<br>Booker, amicus suggests that invalidating §3742(j)(1)(B)&para;<br>would cure any constitutional defect in §3742(g)(2)(B). As&para;<br>the Government explains, however, even if §3742(j)(1)(B)&para;<br>were invalidated and a district court could depart on any&para;<br>ground at an initial sentencing, the district court would&para;<br>not be able to depart on any new ground at resentencing&para;<br>so long as §3742(g)(2) remains in force. Because amicus’&para;<br>proposed solution would still result in the Guidelines&para;<br>being effectively mandatory at resentencing in an entire&para;<br>set of cases, it fails to remedy the fundamental constitu&para;<br>tional defect of §3742(g)(2).&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 Amicus&para;<br>&para;<br>National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers&para;<br>(NACDL) argues that, because §3742(g)(2)(B) permits a non-Guidelines&para;<br>sentence only with respect to certain “departures,” that provision&para;<br>“appears to preclude sentencing courts on remand from granting any&para;<br>and all variances under Section 3553(a).” Brief for NACDL as Amicus&para;<br>Curiae 11 (emphasis added). In Irizarry v. United States, 553 U.

Id., at&para;<br>714. Irizarry’s holding construed the term “departure” in Rule 32(h) of&para;<br>the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Because we conclude that&para;<br>§3742(g)(2) is constitutionally infirm and must be invalidated, we need&para;<br>not decide whether its reference to “departure[s]” includes variances.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>Amicus’ next cluster of arguments focuses on Congress’ sentencing objectives under §3553(a). Preliminarily,&para;<br>amicus contends that even if §3742(g)(2) is constitution&para;<br>ally invalid, that provision reflects a congressional policy&para;<br>determination that only information available at the time&para;<br>of original sentencing should be considered, and that this&para;<br>policy determination should inform our analysis of&para;<br>whether §3553(a) permits consideration of postsentencing&para;<br>rehabilitation evidence. This argument, however, is based&para;<br>on a faulty premise.&para;<br>Contrary to amicus’ contention, §3742(g)(2) does not&para;<br>reflect a congressional purpose to preclude consideration&para;<br>of evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation at resentenc&para;<br>ing. To be sure, §3742(g)(2) has the incidental effect of&para;<br>limiting the weight a sentencing court may place on post&para;<br>sentencing rehabilitation by precluding the court from&para;<br>resentencing outside the Guidelines range on a “ground of&para;<br>departure” on which it did not previously rely. But on its&para;<br>face, nothing in §3742(g)(2) prohibits a district court from&para;<br>considering&para;<br>postsentencing&para;<br>developments—including&para;<br>postsentencing rehabilitation—in selecting a sentence&para;<br>within the applicable Guidelines range. Section 3742(g)(2)&para;<br>also does not apply to resentencings that occur for reasons&para;<br>other than when a sentence is overturned on appeal and&para;<br>the case is remanded (e.g., when a sentence is set aside on&para;<br>collateral review under 28 U. S. C. §2255). In such cir&para;<br>cumstances, §3742(g)(2) does not restrict a district court at&para;<br>all, much less with respect to consideration of postsentenc&para;<br>ing developments. Accordingly, because we see no general&para;<br>congressional policy reflected in §3742(g)(2) to preclude&para;<br>resentencing courts from considering postsentencing&para;<br>information,13 that provision has no bearing on our analy&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 For those of us for whom it is relevant, the legislative history of&para;<br>§3742(g)(2) confirms that the provision, enacted as part of the&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>PEPPER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sis of whether §3553(a) permits consideration of evidence&para;<br>of postsentencing rehabilitation.&para;<br>As we explained above, evidence of postsentencing&para;<br>rehabilitation may be highly relevant to several of the&para;<br>sentencing factors that Congress has specifically in&para;<br>structed district courts to consider. See supra, at 13–15&para;<br>(discussing §§3553(a), (a)(1), (a)(2)(B)–(D)). Amicus, how&para;<br>ever, argues that consideration of postsentencing reha&para;<br>bilitation is inconsistent with two sentencing factors:&para;<br>§3553(a)(5), which directs sentencing courts to consider&para;<br>“any pertinent policy statement” of the Sentencing Com&para;<br>mission, and §3553(a)(6), which requires courts to consider&para;<br>“the need to avoid unwarranted sentenc[ing] disparities&para;<br>among defendants with similar records who have been&para;<br>found guilty of similar conduct.”&para;<br>With regard to §3553(a)(5), amicus points to the Sen&para;<br>tencing Commission’s policy statement in USSG §5K2.19,&para;<br>which provides that “[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative&para;<br>efforts, even if exceptional, undertaken by a defendant&para;<br>after imposition of a term of imprisonment for the instant&para;<br>offense[,] are not an appropriate basis for a downward&para;<br>departure when resentencing the defendant for that of&para;<br>fense.” According to amicus, that policy statement is&para;<br>“clear and unequivocal,” and as an exercise of the Sentenc&para;<br>ing Commission’s “core function,” should be given effect.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>PROTECT Act of 2003, §401(e), 117 Stat. 671, was not aimed at prohib&para;<br>iting district courts from considering postsentencing developments.&para;<br>Rather, it was meant to ensure that under the then-mandatory Guide&para;<br>lines system, when a particular departure was reversed on appeal, the&para;<br>district court could not impose the same sentence on remand on the&para;<br>basis of a different departure. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 108–66, pp. 58–&para;<br>59 (2003) (noting that §401 of the PROTECT Act, inter alia, “prevent[s]&para;<br>sentencing courts, upon remand, from imposing the same illegal depar&para;<br>ture on a different theory”). Like the provisions invalidated in Booker,&para;<br>then, the purpose of §3742(g)(2) was “to make Guidelines sentencing&para;<br>even more mandatory than it had been.” 543 U. S. 220, 261 (2005). As&para;<br>we recognized in Booker, that purpose has “ceased to be relevant.” Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

Id., at 101. As amicus acknowledges, how&para;<br>ever, our post-Booker decisions make clear that a district&para;<br>court may in appropriate cases impose a non-Guidelines&para;<br>sentence based on a disagreement with the Commission’s&para;<br>views. See id., at 109–110. That is particularly true&para;<br>where, as here, the Commission’s views rest on wholly&para;<br>unconvincing policy rationales not reflected in the sentenc&para;<br>ing statutes Congress enacted.&para;<br>The commentary to USSG §5K2.19 expresses the Com&para;<br>mission’s view that departures based on postsentencing&para;<br>rehabilitation would “(1) be inconsistent with the policies&para;<br>established by Congress under 18 U.

Rule&para;<br>Crim. Proc. 35(b)—but neither presents an adequate substitute for a&para;<br>district court’s consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation.

To be sure, Pepper III&para;<br>vacated Pepper’s 24-month sentence on grounds unrelated&para;<br>to the substantial assistance departure, but that fact does&para;<br>not affect our conclusion. “A criminal sentence is a pack&para;<br>age of sanctions that the district court utilizes to effectu&para;<br>ate its sentencing intent.” United States v. Stinson, 97&para;<br>F. 3d 466, 469 (CA11 1996) (per curiam). Because a dis&para;<br>trict court’s “original sentencing intent may be under&para;<br>mined by altering one portion of the calculus,” United&para;<br>States v. White, 406 F. 3d 827, 832 (CA7 2005), an appel&para;<br>late court when reversing one part of a defendant’s sen&para;<br>tence “may vacate the entire sentence . . . so that, on&para;<br>&para;<br>30&para;<br>&para;<br>PEPPER v.

And, like&para;<br>the majority, I believe that the law does not require a&para;<br>sentencing court to follow a Guideline policy statement&para;<br>that forbids taking account of postsentencing rehabilita&para;<br>tion. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines&para;<br>Manual §5K2.19 (Nov. 2010) (USSG). I would emphasize,&para;<br>however, that this conclusion does not leave a sentencing&para;<br>court free to disregard the Guidelines at will. To the&para;<br>contrary, the law permits the court to disregard the Guide&para;<br>lines only where it is “reasonable” for a court to do so.&para;<br>Booker, supra, at 261–262; Gall v. United States, 552 U. S.&para;<br>38, 51–52 (2007); Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S.&para;<br>85, 109 (2007). And an appellate court must be guided by&para;<br>the basic sentencing objectives of the statutes that create&para;<br>the Guidelines in determining whether, in disregarding the&para;<br>Guidelines, the sentencing court has acted unreasonably.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PEPPER v. UNITED STATES &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>The Guideline in question consists of a policy statement&para;<br>that sets forth an exception to normal Guideline rules.&para;<br>Normally, the Guidelines authorize a sentencing judge to&para;<br>consider a departure from an ordinary Guidelines sen&para;<br>tence in any case “where conduct significantly differs from&para;<br>the norm” to which “a particular guideline linguistically&para;<br>applies.” USSG ch. 1, pt. A1, §4(b) (discussing the Guide&para;<br>lines’ general approach to departures). The policy state&para;<br>ment at issue is one of a handful of Guideline rules that&para;<br>nonetheless forbid departure. It says that a defendant’s&para;<br>“[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, even if excep&para;<br>tional, . . . are not an appropriate basis for a downward&para;<br>departure when resentencing.” USSG §5K2.19. The&para;<br>policy statement thereby adds “Post-Sentencing Rehabili&para;<br>tative Efforts” to such factors as race, sex, national origin,&para;<br>creed, religion, and socioeconomic status, which the Guide&para;<br>lines absolutely prohibit the sentencing judge from taking&para;<br>into account. USSG ch. 1, pt. A1, §4(b).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Can a sentencing court, despite this policy statement,&para;<br>take account of postsentencing rehabilitation in the par&para;<br>ticular circumstances that this case presents? I cannot&para;<br>find the answer to this question in the language of the&para;<br>sentencing statutes, in sentencing traditions, in the preGuidelines case of Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241&para;<br>(1949), or in this Court’s use of the word “advisory.” As&para;<br>the majority points out, a sentencing statute forbids any&para;<br>“ ‘limitation’ ” on the “ ‘information concerning the back&para;<br>ground, character, and conduct’ ” that “ ‘a court . . . may . . .&para;<br>consider.’ ” Ante, at 10 (quoting 18 U. S. C. §3661 (empha&para;<br>sis deleted)). But this provision must refer to all relevant&para;<br>information. See USSG §1B1.4 and comment. (generally&para;<br>incorporating §3661, but noting that there are certain&para;<br>factors that should not be considered for any purpose). If&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>the Guideline policy statement’s absolute prohibition on&para;<br>consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation were legally&para;<br>binding, then information on that score (like information&para;<br>about race, religion, sex, or national origin) would fall&para;<br>outside the scope of this provision, for it would not be&para;<br>relevant. Thus, reference to the statute begs the question.&para;<br>Nor can I find much help in the majority’s reference to a&para;<br>sentencing “ ‘tradition’ ” that considers “ ‘every convicted&para;<br>person as an individual.’ ” Ante, at 9 (quoting Koon v.&para;<br>United States, 518 U. S. 81, 113 (1996)). That is because&para;<br>individualized sentencing is not the only relevant tradi&para;<br>tion. A just legal system seeks not only to treat different&para;<br>cases differently but also to treat like cases alike. Fair&para;<br>ness requires sentencing uniformity as well as efforts to&para;<br>recognize relevant sentencing differences. Indeed, when&para;<br>Congress enacted the sentencing statutes before us, it&para;<br>focused upon the unfair way in which federal sentencing&para;<br>failed to treat similar offenders similarly. And Congress&para;<br>wrote statutes designed primarily (though not exclusively)&para;<br>to bring about greater uniformity in sentencing. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Booker, supra, at 253–254. The statutes do so in large&para;<br>part through the creation of a system of Guidelines writ&para;<br>ten by a Sentencing Commission, which Congress in&para;<br>tended the courts to follow. See Mistretta v. United States,&para;<br>488 U. S. 361 (1989) (Sentencing Commission constitu&para;<br>tional); Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338, 348–349&para;<br>(2007); 18 U. S. C. §3553(a) (identifying relevant factors in&para;<br>sentencing, including uniformity).&para;<br>The Williams case is similarly unhelpful. That is be&para;<br>cause Congress in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984—the&para;<br>law before us—disavowed the individualized approach to&para;<br>sentencing that that case followed. Williams emphasized&para;<br>the importance of a sentencing court’s legal power to tailor&para;<br>punishment ability to fit the circumstances of each indi&para;<br>vidual offender. 337 U. S., at 247 (emphasizing “modern&para;<br>concepts individualizing punishment”). But Congress,&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PEPPER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>concerned that individualized sentencing had gone too far,&para;<br>wrote a new sentencing law designed to help correct “dis&para;<br>parities” among similar defendants sentenced by different&para;<br>judges. See S. Rep. No. 98–225, p. 45 (1983) (“Sentencing&para;<br>disparities” are “unfair both to offenders and to the pub&para;<br>lic”); id., at 38 (disparities “can be traced directly to the&para;<br>unfettered discretion the law confers on those judges and&para;<br>parole authorities responsible for imposing and imple&para;<br>menting the sentence”).&para;<br>Booker’s description of the Guidelines as “advisory”&para;<br>offers somewhat greater assistance—but only if that word&para;<br>is read in light of the Sixth Amendment analysis that&para;<br>precedes it. This Court has held that the Sixth Amend&para;<br>ment forbids Congress (through the Commission) to create&para;<br>Guidelines that both (1) require judges (without juries) to&para;<br>find sentencing facts and also (2) tie those facts to the&para;<br>mandatory imposition of particular sentences. 543 U. S.,&para;<br>at 226, 244; see also Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 490 (Sixth&para;<br>Amendment requires jury findings in respect to factual&para;<br>matters that require judge to increase sentence); Blakely&para;<br>v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 303–304 (2004) (same in&para;<br>respect to a State’s mandatory guidelines). In light of this&para;<br>Sixth Amendment prohibition, the Court, believing that&para;<br>Congress would not have intended to introduce new juries&para;<br>into each sentencing proceeding, excised the few particular&para;<br>provisions of the sentencing statutes that specified that&para;<br>application of the Guidelines was mandatory. Booker, 543&para;<br>U. S., at 259. The Court believed that the relevant stat&para;<br>utes remained workable without those few provisions, that&para;<br>their excision could further Congress’ basic sentencing&para;<br>intentions, and that excision was more likely to do so than&para;<br>invalidation of the entire statutory scheme. With an&para;<br>occasional exception (such as the statutory provision we&para;<br>strike down today), there is no reason to think that the&para;<br>sentencing statutes as limited in Booker run afoul of&para;<br>the Sixth Amendment. Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Booker made clear that the remaining statutory provi&para;<br>sions, while leading us to call the Guidelines “advisory”&para;<br>(rather than “mandatory”), do not give a sentencing judge&para;<br>carte blanche to apply, or not to apply, the Guidelines as&para;<br>that judge chooses. Rather, the “district courts, while not&para;<br>bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guide&para;<br>lines and take them into account when sentencing.” Id., at&para;<br>264. Moreover, Booker held that appellate court review of&para;<br>sentencing is valid. Booker explained that the “statutory&para;<br>language, the structure of the [Sentencing Reform Act],&para;<br>and the sound administration of justice,” taken together,&para;<br>require appellate courts to apply “reasonableness stan&para;<br>dard[s]” of review. Id., at 260–261, 262 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). Reasonableness standards, we added, are&para;<br>“not foreign to sentencing law.” Id., at 262. And the “Act&para;<br>has long required their use in important sentencing cir&para;<br>cumstances—both on review of departures . . . and on&para;<br>review of sentences imposed where there was no applica&para;<br>ble Guideline.” Ibid. See also id., at 261 (appellate courts&para;<br>will apply “a practical standard of review already familiar&para;<br>to appellate courts: review for ‘unreasonable[ness]’ ”); id.,&para;<br>at 264 (“[C]ourts of appeals” will “review sentencing deci&para;<br>sions for unreasonableness”).&para;<br>We have also indicated that, in applying reasonableness&para;<br>standards, the appellate courts should take account of&para;<br>sentencing policy as embodied in the statutes and Guide&para;<br>lines, as well as of the comparative expertise of trial and&para;<br>appellate courts. Thus, in Kimbrough, we observed that in&para;<br>light of the “discrete institutional strengths” of the Sen&para;<br>tencing Commission and sentencing judges, “a district&para;<br>court’s decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may&para;<br>attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a&para;<br>particular case ‘outside the “heartland” to which the&para;<br>Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply.’ ” 552&para;<br>U. S., at 109 (quoting Rita, supra, at 351). We noted,&para;<br>however, that “while the Guidelines are no longer binding,&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>PEPPER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge&para;<br>varies from the Guidelines based solely on the judge’s view&para;<br>that the Guidelines range ‘fails properly to reflect §3553(a)&para;<br>considerations’ even in a mine-run case.” 552 U. S., at&para;<br>109.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Unlike the majority, I would decide the question&para;<br>Kimbrough left open. And I would follow its suggested&para;<br>framework for evaluating “reasonableness.” As Kim&para;<br>brough suggests, doing so takes proper account of the&para;<br>comparative institutional abilities of trial courts, appellate&para;<br>courts, and the Sentencing Commission. The trial court&para;<br>typically better understands the individual circumstances&para;<br>of particular cases before it, while the Commission has&para;<br>comparatively greater ability to gather information, to&para;<br>consider a broader national picture, to compare sentences&para;<br>attaching to different offenses, and ultimately to write&para;<br>more coherent overall standards that reflect nationally&para;<br>uniform, not simply local, sentencing policies.&para;<br>Applying Kimbrough’s suggested framework, I would&para;<br>reason very much as does the majority. The first question&para;<br>is whether a sentencing judge might sometimes take ac&para;<br>count of a (resentenced) offender’s postsentencing rehabili&para;<br>tation—despite a Guideline policy statement that says&para;<br>never. I would find that it is reasonable for the judge to&para;<br>disregard the Guidelines’ absolute prohibition, despite the&para;<br>Commission’s comparatively greater policy-formation&para;<br>abilities. That is because the Guideline policy statement&para;<br>itself runs counter to ordinary Guideline sentencing policy,&para;<br>which rarely forbids departures and then for very strong&para;<br>policy reasons. Supra, at 2. See USSG ch. 1, pt. A1, §4(b).&para;<br>The Commission offers no convincing justification for&para;<br>creating this exception with respect to postsentencing&para;<br>rehabilitation. The Commission’s commentary says that&para;<br>for a judge at resentencing to lower a sentence for this&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>reason (reflecting good behavior while the case is on ap&para;<br>peal) would conflict with the use of other mechanisms,&para;<br>such as “good-time” credits, for that purpose. But how is&para;<br>that so? A defendant, after sentencing but while his case&para;<br>is on appeal, may or may not be entitled to “good time.”&para;<br>That may depend upon whether he remains on bail or&para;<br>upon particular “good-time” rules. Regardless, the resen&para;<br>tencing judge can take account of any such matter. See&para;<br>also ante, at 26–28.&para;<br>The Commission’s commentary also suggests it would be&para;<br>inequitable to allow an offender who is being resentenced&para;<br>to receive any kind of credit for his good behavior, say&para;<br>while his case was on appeal. But why is that so? After&para;<br>all, the Guidelines permit a judge to take account of an&para;<br>offender’s good behavior after arrest but before initial&para;<br>sentencing. That time period could last longer than the&para;<br>time taken up on appeal. Why should pretrial behavior&para;<br>count but appeal time behavior not count? Like the major&para;<br>ity, I find this justification for the policy statement uncon&para;<br>vincing. See ante, at 25–26.&para;<br>The second question is whether, given the sentencing&para;<br>court’s power to disregard the policy statement forbidding&para;<br>departures based on postsentencing rehabilitation, the&para;<br>facts and circumstances here could warrant a departure&para;<br>(or variance) for that reason. And the answer, in my view,&para;<br>is yes. This case presents unusual rehabilitative circum&para;<br>stances. As the majority observes: “By the time of his&para;<br>second resentencing in 2009, Pepper had been drug-free&para;<br>for nearly five years, had attended college and achieved&para;<br>high grades, was a top employee at his job slated for a&para;<br>promotion, had reestablished a relationship with his&para;<br>father, and was married and supporting his wife’s daugh&para;<br>ter.” Ante, at 14. These are case-specific facts and cir&para;<br>cumstances, and they are of the kind that should lead&para;<br>appellate courts to show their “greatest respect” for a&para;<br>sentencing decision, including a departure or variance,&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PEPPER v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>that rests upon them.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>In sum, the sentencing statutes, as we have interpreted&para;<br>them, require courts of appeals to review sentences for&para;<br>reasonableness, including sentences that depart or vary&para;<br>from a specific Guideline. The appellate courts should&para;<br>review those decisions more closely when they rest upon&para;<br>disagreement with Guidelines policy. Kimbrough, 552&para;<br>U. S., at 109. They should review those decisions with&para;<br>greater deference when they rest upon case-specific cir&para;<br>cumstances that place the case outside a specific Guide&para;<br>line’s “heartland.” See ibid.; Rita, 551 U. S., at 351; Koon,&para;<br>518 U. S., at 98–99.&para;<br>By interpreting the sentencing statutes in this way, we&para;<br>can remain faithful to Congress’ basic intent in writing&para;<br>them—despite the need to invalidate statutory provisions&para;<br>that conflict with the Sixth Amendment. The statutes&para;<br>create a Sentencing Commission with authority to develop&para;<br>sentencing policy embodied in the Guidelines. The Guide&para;<br>lines are to further the statutes’ basic objective, namely&para;<br>greater sentencing uniformity, while also taking account&para;<br>of special individual circumstances, primarily by permit&para;<br>ting the sentencing court to depart in nontypical cases. By&para;<br>collecting trial courts’ reasons for departure (or variance),&para;<br>by examining appellate court reactions, by developing&para;<br>statistical and other empirical information, by considering&para;<br>the views of expert penologists and others, the Commis&para;<br>sion can revise the Guidelines accordingly. See USSG ch.&para;<br>1, pt. A1, §3. Trial courts, appellate courts, and the Com&para;<br>mission all have a role to play in what is meant to be an&para;<br>iterative, cooperative institutional effort to bring about a&para;<br>more uniform and a more equitable sentencing system.&para;<br>See id., at 1–15.

As written, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines&para;<br>do not permit district courts to impose a sentence below&para;<br>the Guidelines range based on the defendant’s postsen&para;<br>tencing rehabilitation.1 See United States Sentencing&para;<br>Commission, Guidelines Manual §5K2.19 (Nov. 2010)&para;<br>(USSG). Therefore, I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>In United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 258–265&para;<br>(2005), the Court rendered the entire Guidelines scheme&para;<br>advisory, a remedy that was “far broader than necessary&para;<br>to correct constitutional error.” Kimbrough v. United&para;<br>States, 552 U. S. 85, 114 (2007) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).&para;<br>Because there is “no principled way to apply the Booker&para;<br>remedy,” I have explained that it is “best to apply the&para;<br>statute as written, including 18 U. S. C. §3553(b), which&para;<br>makes the Guidelines mandatory,” unless doing so would&para;<br>actually violate the Sixth Amendment. Id., at 116; see&para;<br>Booker, supra, at 313–326 (THOMAS, J., dissenting in&para;<br>part); Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 61 (2007) (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Irizarry v. United States, 553 U.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>because doing so would not violate the Sixth Amendment.&para;<br>The constitutional problem arises only when a judge&para;<br>makes “a finding that raises the sentence beyond the&para;<br>sentence that could have lawfully been imposed by refer&para;<br>ence to facts found by the jury or admitted by the defen&para;<br>dant.” Booker, supra, at 313 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).&para;<br>Pepper admitted in his plea agreement to involvement&para;<br>with between 1,500 and 5,000 grams of methamphetamine&para;<br>mixture, which carries a sentence of 10 years to life under&para;<br>21 U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(A)(viii).2 United States v. Pepper,&para;<br>412 F. 3d 995, 996 (CA8 2005). Because Pepper has ad&para;<br>mitted facts that would support a much longer sentence&para;<br>than the 65 months he received, there is no Sixth Amend&para;<br>ment problem in this case.&para;<br>Under a mandatory Guidelines regime, Pepper’s sen&para;<br>tence was proper. The District Court correctly calculated&para;<br>the Guidelines range, incorporated a USSG §5K1.1 depar&para;<br>ture and the Government’s motion under Federal Rule&para;<br>of Criminal Procedure 35(b), and settled on a 65-month&para;<br>sentence. Guideline §5K2.19 expressly prohibits down&para;<br>ward departures based on “[p]ost-sentencing rehabilitative&para;<br>efforts, even if exceptional.” Nor is there any provision in&para;<br>the Guidelines for the “variance” Pepper seeks, as such&para;<br>variances are creations of the Booker remedy. I would&para;<br>therefore affirm the Court of Appeals’ decision to uphold&para;<br>Pepper’s sentence.&para;<br>Although this outcome would not represent my own&para;<br>policy choice, I am bound by the choices made by Congress&para;<br>and the Federal Sentencing Commission. Like the major&para;<br>ity, I believe that postsentencing rehabilitation can be&para;<br>highly relevant to meaningful resentencing. See ante, at&para;<br>13–15. In light of Pepper’s success in escaping drug addic&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Pepper also stated that he understood both the 10-year statutory&para;<br>minimum and that the Government was making no promises about any&para;<br>exceptions.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.
