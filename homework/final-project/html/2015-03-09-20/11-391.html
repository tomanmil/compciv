MARCHIO, EXECUTRIX OF THE ESTATE OF&para;<br>PAULINE VIRGINIA WILLETT&para;<br>ON PETITIONS FOR WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME &para;<br>&para;<br>COURT OF APPEALS OF WEST VIRGINIA&para;<br>&para;<br>Nos. 11–391 and 11–394.&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided February 21, 2012&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>State and federal courts must enforce the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq., with respect to all&para;<br>arbitration agreements covered by that statute. Here, the&para;<br>Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, by misreading&para;<br>and disregarding the precedents of this Court interpreting&para;<br>the FAA, did not follow controlling federal law implementing that basic principle. The state court held unenforceable all predispute arbitration agreements that apply to&para;<br>claims alleging personal injury or wrongful death against&para;<br>nursing homes.&para;<br>The decision of the state court found the FAA’s coverage&para;<br>to be more limited than mandated by this Court’s previous&para;<br>cases. The decision of the State Supreme Court of Appeals&para;<br>must be vacated. When this Court has fulfilled its duty to&para;<br>interpret federal law, a state court may not contradict or&para;<br>fail to implement the rule so established. See U. S. Const.,&para;<br>Art. VI, cl. 2.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MARMET HEALTH CARE CENTER v. BROWN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>This litigation involves three negligence suits against&para;<br>nursing homes in West Virginia. The suits were brought&para;<br>by Clayton Brown, Jeffrey Taylor, and Sharon Marchio.&para;<br>In each case, a family member of a patient requiring extensive nursing care had signed an agreement with a&para;<br>nursing home on behalf of the patient. The relevant parts&para;<br>of the agreements in Brown’s case and Taylor’s case were&para;<br>identical. The contracts included a clause requiring the&para;<br>parties to arbitrate all disputes, other than claims to collect late payments owed by the patient. The contracts&para;<br>included a provision holding the party filing the arbitration responsible for paying a filing fee in accordance with&para;<br>the Rules of the American Arbitration Association fee&para;<br>schedules. The agreement in Marchio’s case also included&para;<br>a clause requiring arbitration but made no exceptions to&para;<br>the arbitration requirement and did not mention filing&para;<br>fees.&para;<br>In each of the three cases, a family member of a patient&para;<br>who had died sued the nursing home in state court, alleging that negligence caused injuries or harm resulting in&para;<br>death. A state trial court dismissed the suits by Brown&para;<br>and Taylor based on the agreements to arbitrate. The&para;<br>Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia consolidated&para;<br>those cases with Marchio’s, which was before the court on&para;<br>other issues.&para;<br>In a decision concerning all three cases, the state court&para;<br>held that “as a matter of public policy under West Virginia&para;<br>law, an arbitration clause in a nursing home admission&para;<br>agreement adopted prior to an occurrence of negligence&para;<br>that results in a personal injury or wrongful death, shall&para;<br>not be enforced to compel arbitration of a dispute concerning the negligence.” Brown v. Genesis Healthcare Corp.,&para;<br>No. 35494 (W. Va., June 29, 2011), App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>in No. 11–391, pp. 85a–86a (hereinafter Pet. App.). The&para;<br>state court considered whether the state public policy was&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>pre-empted by the FAA. The state court found unpersuasive this Court’s interpretation of the FAA, calling it “tendentious,” id., at 51a, and “created from whole cloth,” id.,&para;<br>at 53a. It later concluded that “Congress did not intend&para;<br>for the FAA to be, in any way, applicable to personal&para;<br>injury or wrongful death suits that only collaterally derive&para;<br>from a written agreement that evidences a transaction&para;<br>affecting interstate commerce, particularly where the&para;<br>agreement involves a service that is a practical necessity&para;<br>for members of the public,” id., at 84a. The court thus&para;<br>concluded that the FAA does not pre-empt the state public policy against predispute arbitration agreements that&para;<br>apply to claims of personal injury or wrongful death&para;<br>against nursing homes.&para;<br>The West Virginia court’s interpretation of the FAA was&para;<br>both incorrect and inconsistent with clear instruction in&para;<br>the precedents of this Court. The FAA provides that a&para;<br>“written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction&para;<br>. . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon&para;<br>such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation&para;<br>of any contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2. The statute’s text includes&para;<br>no exception for personal-injury or wrongful-death claims.&para;<br>It “requires courts to enforce the bargain of the parties to&para;<br>arbitrate.” Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S.&para;<br>213, 217 (1985). It “reflects an emphatic federal policy in&para;<br>favor of arbitral dispute resolution.” KPMG LLP v. Cocchi, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (per curiam) (slip op., at 3)&para;<br>(quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler ChryslerPlymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 631 (1985); internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>As this Court reaffirmed last Term, “[w]hen state law&para;<br>prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of&para;<br>claim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule&para;<br>is displaced by the FAA.” AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concep-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MARMET HEALTH CARE CENTER v. BROWN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>cion, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6–7). That rule&para;<br>resolves these cases. West Virginia’s prohibition against&para;<br>predispute agreements to arbitrate personal-injury or&para;<br>wrongful-death claims against nursing homes is a categorical rule prohibiting arbitration of a particular type of&para;<br>claim, and that rule is contrary to the terms and coverage&para;<br>of the FAA. See ibid. See also, e.g., Preston v. Ferrer, 552&para;<br>U. S. 346, 356 (2008) (FAA pre-empts state law granting&para;<br>state commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to decide issue&para;<br>the parties agreed to arbitrate); Mastrobuono v. Shearson&para;<br>Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U. S. 52, 56 (1995) (FAA preempts state law requiring judicial resolution of claims&para;<br>involving punitive damages); Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S.&para;<br>483, 491 (1987) (FAA pre-empts state-law requirement&para;<br>that litigants be provided a judicial forum for wage disputes); Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 10&para;<br>(1984) (FAA pre-empts state financial investment statute’s&para;<br>prohibition of arbitration of claims brought under that&para;<br>statute).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The West Virginia court proposed an “alternativ[e]” holding that the particular arbitration clauses in Brown’s&para;<br>case and Taylor’s case were unconscionable. Pet. App.&para;<br>89a–91a, 94a. See also id., at 98a (not addressing the&para;<br>question whether the arbitration agreement in Marchio’s&para;<br>case is unenforceable for reasons other than public policy).&para;<br>It is unclear, however, to what degree the state court’s&para;<br>alternative holding was influenced by the invalid, categorical rule discussed above, the rule against predispute&para;<br>arbitration agreements. For example, in its discussion of&para;<br>the alternative holding, the state court found the arbitration clauses unconscionable in part because a predispute&para;<br>arbitration agreement that applies to claims of personal&para;<br>injury or wrongful death against nursing homes “clearly&para;<br>violates public policy.” Id., at 91a.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>On remand, the West Virginia court must consider&para;<br>whether, absent that general public policy, the arbitration&para;<br>clauses in Brown’s case and Taylor’s case are unenforceable under state common law principles that are not specific to arbitration and pre-empted by the FAA.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of&para;<br>the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia is vacated,&para;<br>and the cases are remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
