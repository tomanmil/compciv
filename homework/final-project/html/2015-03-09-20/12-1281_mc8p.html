Argued January 13, 2014—Decided June 26, 2014&para;<br>Respondent Noel Canning, a Pepsi-Cola distributor, asked the D. C.&para;<br>Circuit to set aside an order of the National Labor Relations Board,&para;<br>claiming that the Board lacked a quorum because three of the five&para;<br>Board members had been invalidly appointed. The nominations of&para;<br>the three members in question were pending in the Senate when it&para;<br>passed a December 17, 2011, resolution providing for a series of “pro&para;<br>forma session[s],” with “no business . . . transacted,” every Tuesday&para;<br>and Friday through January 20, 2012. S. J., 112th Cong., 1st Sess.,&para;<br>923. Invoking the Recess Appointments Clause—which gives the&para;<br>President the power “to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during&para;<br>the Recess of the Senate,” Art. II, §2, cl. 3—the President appointed&para;<br>the three members in question between the January 3 and January 6&para;<br>pro forma sessions. Noel Canning argued primarily that the appointments were invalid because the 3-day adjournment between&para;<br>those two sessions was not long enough to trigger the Recess Appointments Clause. The D. C. Circuit agreed that the appointments&para;<br>fell outside the scope of the Clause, but on different grounds. It held&para;<br>that the phrase “the recess,” as used in the Clause, does not include&para;<br>intra-session recesses, and that the phrase “vacancies that may happen during the recess” applies only to vacancies that first come into&para;<br>existence during a recess.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The Recess Appointments Clause empowers the President to fill&para;<br>any existing vacancy during any recess—intra-session or intersession—of sufficient length. Pp. 5–33.&para;<br>(a) Two background considerations are relevant to the questions&para;<br>here. First, the Recess Appointments Clause is a subsidiary method&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>for appointing officers of the United States. The Founders intended&para;<br>the norm to be the method of appointment in Article II, §2, cl. 2,&para;<br>which requires Senate approval of Presidential nominations, at least&para;<br>for principal officers. The Recess Appointments Clause reflects the&para;<br>tension between the President’s continuous need for “the assistance&para;<br>of subordinates,” Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 117, and the&para;<br>Senate’s early practice of meeting for a single brief session each year.&para;<br>The Clause should be interpreted as granting the President the power to make appointments during a recess but not offering the President the authority routinely to avoid the need for Senate confirmation.&para;<br>Second, in interpreting the Clause, the Court puts significant&para;<br>weight upon historical practice. The longstanding “practice of the&para;<br>government,” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 401, can inform&para;<br>this Court’s determination of “what the law is” in a separation-ofpowers case, Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176. See also, e.g.,&para;<br>Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 401; The Pocket Veto Case,&para;<br>279 U. S. 655, 689–690. There is a great deal of history to consider&para;<br>here, for Presidents have made recess appointments since the beginning of the Republic. Their frequency suggests that the Senate and&para;<br>President have recognized that such appointments can be both necessary and appropriate in certain circumstances. The Court, in interpreting the Clause for the first time, must hesitate to upset the compromises and working arrangements that the elected branches of&para;<br>Government themselves have reached. Pp. 5–9.&para;<br>(b) The phrase “the recess of the Senate” applies to both intersession recess (i.e., breaks between formal sessions of the Senate) and&para;<br>intra-session recesses (i.e., breaks in the midst of a formal session) of&para;<br>substantial length. The constitutional text is ambiguous. Foundingera dictionaries and usages show that the phrase “the recess” can encompass intra-session breaks. And this broader interpretation is&para;<br>demanded by the purpose of the Clause, which is to allow the President to make appointments so as to ensure the continued functioning&para;<br>of the Government while the Senate is away. The Senate is equally&para;<br>away and unavailable to participate in the appointments process during both an inter-session and an intra-session recess. History offers&para;<br>further support for this interpretation. From the founding until the&para;<br>Great Depression, every time the Senate took a substantial, nonholiday intra-session recess, the President made recess appointments. President Andrew Johnson made the first documented intrasession recess appointments in 1867 and 1868, and Presidents made&para;<br>similar appointments in 1921 and 1929. Since 1929, and particularly&para;<br>since the end of World War II, Congress has shortened its intersession breaks and taken longer and more frequent intra-session&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>breaks; Presidents accordingly have made more intra-session recess&para;<br>appointments. Meanwhile, the Senate has never taken any formal&para;<br>action to deny the validity of intra-session recess appointments. In&para;<br>1905, the Senate Judiciary Committee defined “the recess” as “the&para;<br>period of time when the Senate” is absent and cannot “participate as&para;<br>a body in making appointments,” S. Rep. No. 4389, 58th Cong., 3d&para;<br>Sess., p. 2, and that functional definition encompasses both intrasession and inter-session recesses. A 1940 law regulating the payment of recess appointees has also been interpreted functionally by&para;<br>the Comptroller General (an officer of the Legislative Branch). In&para;<br>sum, Presidents have made intra-session recess appointments for a&para;<br>century and a half, and the Senate has never taken formal action to&para;<br>oppose them. That practice is long enough to entitle it to “great&para;<br>weight in a proper interpretation” of the constitutional provision.&para;<br>The Pocket Veto Case, supra, at 689.&para;<br>The Clause does not say how long a recess must be in order to fall&para;<br>within the Clause, but even the Solicitor General concedes that a 3day recess would be too short. The Adjournments Clause, Art. I, §5,&para;<br>cl. 4, reflects the fact that a 3-day break is not a significant interruption of legislative business. A Senate recess that is so short that it&para;<br>does not require the consent of the House under that Clause is not&para;<br>long enough to trigger the President’s recess-appointment power.&para;<br>Moreover, the Court has not found a single example of a recess appointment made during an intra-session recess that was shorter than&para;<br>10 days. There are a few examples of inter-session recess appointments made during recesses of less than 10 days, but these are&para;<br>anomalies. In light of historical practice, a recess of more than 3&para;<br>days but less than 10 days is presumptively too short to fall within&para;<br>the Clause. The word “presumptively” leaves open the possibility&para;<br>that a very unusual circumstance could demand the exercise of the&para;<br>recess-appointment power during a shorter break. Pp. 9–21.&para;<br>(c) The phrase “vacancies that may happen during the recess of&para;<br>the Senate,” Art. II, §2, cl. 3, applies both to vacancies that first come&para;<br>into existence during a recess and to vacancies that initially occur before a recess but continue to exist during the recess. Again, the text&para;<br>is ambiguous. As Thomas Jefferson observed, the Clause is “certainly susceptible of [two] constructions.” Letter to Wilson Cary Nicholas&para;<br>(Jan. 26, 1802), in 36 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 433. It “may mean&para;<br>‘vacancies that may happen to be’ or ‘may happen to fall’ ” during a&para;<br>recess. Ibid. And, as Attorney General Wirt wrote in 1821, the&para;<br>broader reading is more consonant with the “reason and spirit” of the&para;<br>Clause. 1 Op. Atty. Gen. 632. The purpose of the Clause is to permit&para;<br>the President, who is always acting to execute the law, to obtain the&para;<br>assistance of subordinate officers while the Senate, which acts only in&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>intervals, is unavailable to confirm them. If a vacancy arises too late&para;<br>in the session for the President and Senate to have an opportunity to&para;<br>select a replacement, the narrower reading could paralyze important&para;<br>functions of the Federal Government, particularly at the time of the&para;<br>founding. The broader interpretation ensures that offices needing to&para;<br>be filled can be filled. It does raise a danger that the President may&para;<br>attempt to use the recess-appointment power to circumvent the Senate’s advice and consent role. But the narrower interpretation risks&para;<br>undermining constitutionally conferred powers more seriously and&para;<br>more often. It would prevent a President from making any recess&para;<br>appointment to fill a vacancy that arose before a recess, no matter&para;<br>who the official, how dire the need, how uncontroversial the appointment, and how late in the session the office fell vacant.&para;<br>Historical practice also strongly favors the broader interpretation.&para;<br>The tradition of applying the Clause to pre-recess vacancies dates at&para;<br>least to President Madison. Nearly every Attorney General to consider the question has approved the practice, and every President&para;<br>since James Buchanan has made recess appointments to pre-existing&para;<br>vacancies. It is a fair inference from the historical data that a large&para;<br>proportion of recess appointments over our Nation’s history have&para;<br>filled pre-recess vacancies. The Senate Judiciary Committee in 1863&para;<br>did issue a report disagreeing with the broader interpretation, and&para;<br>Congress passed a law known as the Pay Act prohibiting payment of&para;<br>recess appointments to pre-recess vacancies soon after. However, the&para;<br>Senate subsequently abandoned its hostility. In 1940, the Senate&para;<br>amended the Pay Act to permit payment of recess appointees in circumstances that would be unconstitutional under the narrower interpretation. In short, Presidents have made recess appointments to&para;<br>preexisting vacancies for two centuries, and the Senate as a body has&para;<br>not countered this practice for nearly three-quarters of a century,&para;<br>perhaps longer. The Court is reluctant to upset this traditional practice where doing so would seriously shrink the authority that Presidents have believed existed and have exercised for so long. Pp. 21–&para;<br>33.&para;<br>2. For purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is&para;<br>in session when it says that it is, provided that, under its own rules,&para;<br>it retains the capacity to transact Senate business.&para;<br>This standard is consistent with the Constitution’s broad delegation of authority to the Senate to determine how and when to conduct&para;<br>its business, as recognized by this Court’s precedents. See Art. I, §5,&para;<br>cl. 2; Marshall Field &amp; Co. v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 672; United States&para;<br>v. Ballin, 144 U. S. 1, 5, 9. Although the Senate’s own determination&para;<br>of when it is and is not in session should be given great weight, the&para;<br>Court’s deference cannot be absolute. When the Senate is without&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>the capacity to act, under its own rules, it is not in session even if it&para;<br>so declares.&para;<br>Under the standard set forth here, the Senate was in session during the pro forma sessions at issue. It said it was in session, and&para;<br>Senate rules make clear that the Senate retained the power to conduct business. The Senate could have conducted business simply by&para;<br>passing a unanimous consent agreement. In fact, it did so; it passed&para;<br>a bill by unanimous consent during its pro forma session on December 23, 2011. See 2011 S. J. 924; Pub. L. 112–78. The Court will not,&para;<br>as the Solicitor General urges, engage in an in-depth factual appraisal of what the Senate actually did during its pro forma sessions in order to determine whether it was in recess or in session for purposes of&para;<br>the Recess Appointments Clause.&para;<br>Because the Senate was in session during its pro forma sessions,&para;<br>the President made the recess appointments at issue during a 3-day&para;<br>recess. Three days is too short a time to bring a recess within the&para;<br>scope of the Clause, so the President lacked the authority to make&para;<br>those appointments. Pp. 33–41.&para;<br>705 F. 3d 490, affirmed.&para;<br>BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which KENNEDY,&para;<br>GINSBURG, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., joined.

NOEL CANNING, ET AL.&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[June 26, 2014]&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>Ordinarily the President must obtain “the Advice and&para;<br>Consent of the Senate” before appointing an “Office[r] of&para;<br>the United States.” U. S. Const., Art. II, §2, cl. 2. But the&para;<br>Recess Appointments Clause creates an exception. It&para;<br>gives the President alone the power “to fill up all Vacan­&para;<br>cies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by&para;<br>granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of&para;<br>their next Session.” Art. II, §2, cl. 3. We here consider&para;<br>three questions about the application of this Clause.&para;<br>The first concerns the scope of the words “recess of the&para;<br>Senate.” Does that phrase refer only to an inter-session&para;<br>recess (i.e., a break between formal sessions of Congress),&para;<br>or does it also include an intra-session recess, such as a&para;<br>summer recess in the midst of a session? We conclude&para;<br>that the Clause applies to both kinds of recess.&para;<br>The second question concerns the scope of the words&para;<br>“vacancies that may happen.” Does that phrase refer only&para;<br>to vacancies that first come into existence during a recess,&para;<br>or does it also include vacancies that arise prior to a recess&para;<br>but continue to exist during the recess? We conclude that&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the Clause applies to both kinds of vacancy.&para;<br>The third question concerns calculation of the length of&para;<br>a “recess.” The President made the appointments here at&para;<br>issue on January 4, 2012. At that time the Senate was in&para;<br>recess pursuant to a December 17, 2011, resolution providing for a series of brief recesses punctuated by “pro forma&para;<br>session[s],” with “no business . . . transacted,” every Tuesday and Friday through January 20, 2012. S. J., 112th&para;<br>Cong., 1st Sess., 923 (2011) (hereinafter 2011 S. J.). In&para;<br>calculating the length of a recess are we to ignore the pro&para;<br>forma sessions, thereby treating the series of brief recesses&para;<br>as a single, month-long recess? We conclude that we&para;<br>cannot ignore these pro forma sessions.&para;<br>Our answer to the third question means that, when the&para;<br>appointments before us took place, the Senate was in the&para;<br>midst of a 3-day recess. Three days is too short a time to&para;<br>bring a recess within the scope of the Clause. Thus we&para;<br>conclude that the President lacked the power to make the&para;<br>recess appointments here at issue.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The case before us arises out of a labor dispute. The&para;<br>National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) found that a&para;<br>Pepsi-Cola distributor, Noel Canning, had unlawfully&para;<br>refused to reduce to writing and execute a collectivebargaining agreement with a labor union. The Board&para;<br>ordered the distributor to execute the agreement and to&para;<br>make employees whole for any losses. Noel Canning, 358&para;<br>N. L. R. B. No. 4 (2012).&para;<br>The Pepsi-Cola distributor subsequently asked the&para;<br>Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to set&para;<br>the Board’s order aside. It claimed that three of the five&para;<br>Board members had been invalidly appointed, leaving the&para;<br>Board without the three lawfully appointed members&para;<br>necessary for it to act. See 29 U. S. C. §160(f) (providing&para;<br>for judicial review); §153(a) (providing for a 5-member&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>A to opinion&para;<br>of the Court&para;<br>of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Board); §153(b) (providing for a 3-member quorum); New&para;<br>Process Steel, L. P. v. NLRB, 560 U. S. 674, 687–688&para;<br>(2010) (in the absence of a lawfully appointed quorum, the&para;<br>Board cannot exercise its powers).&para;<br>The three members in question were Sharon Block,&para;<br>Richard Griffin, and Terence Flynn. In 2011 the President&para;<br>had nominated each of them to the Board. As of January&para;<br>2012, Flynn’s nomination had been pending in the Senate&para;<br>awaiting confirmation for approximately a year. The&para;<br>nominations of each of the other two had been pending for&para;<br>a few weeks. On January 4, 2012, the President, invoking&para;<br>the Recess Appointments Clause, appointed all three to&para;<br>the Board.&para;<br>The distributor argued that the Recess Appointments&para;<br>Clause did not authorize those appointments. It pointed&para;<br>out that on December 17, 2011, the Senate, by unanimous&para;<br>consent, had adopted a resolution providing that it would&para;<br>take a series of brief recesses beginning the following day.&para;<br>See 2011 S. J. 923. Pursuant to that resolution, the Sen­&para;<br>ate held pro forma sessions every Tuesday and Friday&para;<br>until it returned for ordinary business on January 23,&para;<br>2012. Ibid.; 158 Cong. Rec. S1–S11 (Jan. 3–20, 2012). The&para;<br>President’s January 4 appointments were made between&para;<br>the January 3 and January 6 pro forma sessions. In the&para;<br>distributor’s view, each pro forma session terminated the&para;<br>immediately preceding recess. Accordingly, the appoint­&para;<br>ments were made during a 3-day adjournment, which is&para;<br>not long enough to trigger the Recess Appointments&para;<br>Clause.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals agreed that the appointments fell&para;<br>outside the scope of the Clause. But the court set forth&para;<br>different reasons. It held that the Clause’s words “the&para;<br>recess of the Senate” do not include recesses that occur&para;<br>within a formal session of Congress, i.e., intra-session&para;<br>recesses. Rather those words apply only to recesses between those formal sessions, i.e., inter-session recesses.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Since the second session of the 112th Congress began on&para;<br>January 3, 2012, the day before the President’s appointments, those appointments occurred during an intrasession recess, and the appointments consequently fell&para;<br>outside the scope of the Clause. 705 F. 3d 490, 499–507&para;<br>(CADC 2013).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals added that, in any event, the&para;<br>phrase “vacancies that may happen during the recess”&para;<br>applies only to vacancies that come into existence during a&para;<br>recess. Id., at 507–512. The vacancies that Members&para;<br>Block, Griffin, and Flynn were appointed to fill had arisen&para;<br>before the beginning of the recess during which they were&para;<br>appointed. For this reason too the President’s appointments were invalid. And, because the Board lacked a&para;<br>quorum of validly appointed members when it issued its&para;<br>order, the order was invalid. 29 U. S. C. §153(b); New&para;<br>Process Steel, supra.&para;<br>We granted the Solicitor General’s petition for certiorari. We asked the parties to address not only the Court of&para;<br>Appeals’ interpretation of the Clause but also the distributor’s initial argument, namely, “[w]hether the President’s&para;<br>recess-appointment power may be exercised when the&para;<br>Senate is convening every three days in pro forma sessions.” 570 U. S. ___ (2013).&para;<br>We shall answer all three questions presented. We&para;<br>recognize that the President has nominated others to fill&para;<br>the positions once occupied by Members Block, Griffin,&para;<br>and Flynn, and that the Senate has confirmed these successors. But, as the parties recognize, the fact that the&para;<br>Board now unquestionably has a quorum does not moot&para;<br>the controversy about the validity of the previously entered Board order. And there are pending before us petitions from decisions in other cases involving challenges to&para;<br>the appointment of Board Member Craig Becker. The&para;<br>President appointed Member Becker during an intrasession recess that was not punctuated by pro forma ses-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

See Congressional Research&para;<br>Service, H. Hogue, M. Carey, M. Greene, &amp; M. Bearden,&para;<br>The Noel Canning Decision and Recess Appointments&para;<br>Made from 1981–2013, p. 28 (Feb. 4, 2013) (hereinaf­&para;<br>ter The Noel Canning Decision); NLRB, Members of&para;<br>the NLRB since 1935, online at http://www.nlrb.gov/&para;<br>who-we-are/board/members-nlrb-1935 (all Internet mate­&para;<br>rials as visited June 24, 2014, and available in Clerk of&para;<br>Court’s case file). Other cases involving similar challenges&para;<br>are also pending in the Courts of Appeals. E.g., NLRB v.&para;<br>New Vista Nursing &amp; Rehabilitation, No. 11–3440 etc.&para;<br>(CA3). Thus, we believe it is important to answer all three&para;<br>questions that this case presents.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Before turning to the specific questions presented, we&para;<br>shall mention two background considerations that we find&para;<br>relevant to all three. First, the Recess Appointments&para;<br>Clause sets forth a subsidiary, not a primary, method for&para;<br>appointing officers of the United States. The immediately&para;<br>preceding Clause—Article II, Section 2, Clause 2—&para;<br>provides the primary method of appointment. It says that&para;<br>the President “shall nominate, and by and with the Advice&para;<br>and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors,&para;<br>other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme&para;<br>Court, and all other Officers of the United States” (empha­&para;<br>sis added).&para;<br>The Federalist Papers make clear that the Founders&para;<br>intended this method of appointment, requiring Senate&para;<br>approval, to be the norm (at least for principal officers).&para;<br>Alexander Hamilton wrote that the Constitution vests the&para;<br>power of nomination in the President alone because “one&para;<br>man of discernment is better fitted to analise and estimate&para;<br>the peculiar qualities adapted to particular offices, than a&para;<br>body of men of equal, or perhaps even of superior discern­&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ment.” The Federalist No. 76, p. 510 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).&para;<br>At the same time, the need to secure Senate approval&para;<br>provides “an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in&para;<br>the President, and would tend greatly to preventing the&para;<br>appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from&para;<br>family connection, from personal attachment, or from a&para;<br>view to popularity.” Id., at 513. Hamilton further explained that the&para;<br>“ordinary power of appointment is confided to the&para;<br>President and Senate jointly, and can therefore only&para;<br>be exercised during the session of the Senate; but as it&para;<br>would have been improper to oblige this body to be&para;<br>continually in session for the appointment of officers;&para;<br>and as vacancies might happen in their recess, which&para;<br>it might be necessary for the public service to fill&para;<br>without delay, the succeeding clause is evidently intended to authorise the President singly to make temporary appointments.” Id., No. 67, at 455.&para;<br>Thus the Recess Appointments Clause reflects the tension between, on the one hand, the President’s continuous&para;<br>need for “the assistance of subordinates,” Myers v. United&para;<br>States, 272 U. S. 52, 117 (1926), and, on the other, the&para;<br>Senate’s practice, particularly during the Republic’s early&para;<br>years, of meeting for a single brief session each year, see&para;<br>Art. I, §4, cl. 2; Amdt. 20, §2 (requiring the Senate to&para;<br>“assemble” only “once in every year”); 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §1551, p.&para;<br>410 (1833) (it would be “burthensome to the senate, and&para;<br>expensive to the public” to require the Senate to be “perpetually in session”). We seek to interpret the Clause as&para;<br>granting the President the power to make appointments&para;<br>during a recess but not offering the President the authority routinely to avoid the need for Senate confirmation.&para;<br>Second, in interpreting the Clause, we put significant&para;<br>weight upon historical practice. For one thing, the inter-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

We have not previously interpreted the Clause,&para;<br>and, when doing so for the first time in more than 200&para;<br>years, we must hesitate to upset the compromises and&para;<br>working arrangements that the elected branches of Gov­&para;<br>ernment themselves have reached.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The first question concerns the scope of the phrase “the&para;<br>recess of the Senate.” Art. II, §2, cl. 3 (emphasis added).&para;<br>The Constitution provides for congressional elections&para;<br>every two years. And the 2-year life of each elected Con­&para;<br>gress typically consists of two formal 1-year sessions, each&para;<br>separated from the next by an “inter-session recess.”&para;<br>Congressional Research Service, H. Hogue, Recess Ap­&para;<br>pointments: Frequently Asked Questions 2 (2013). The&para;<br>Senate or the House of Representatives announces an&para;<br>inter-session recess by approving a resolution stating that&para;<br>it will “adjourn sine die,” i.e., without specifying a date to&para;<br>return (in which case Congress will reconvene when the&para;<br>next formal session is scheduled to begin).&para;<br>The Senate and the House also take breaks in the midst&para;<br>of a session. The Senate or the House announces any such&para;<br>“intra-session recess” by adopting a resolution stating that&para;<br>it will “adjourn” to a fixed date, a few days or weeks or&para;<br>even months later. All agree that the phrase “the recess of&para;<br>the Senate” covers inter-session recesses. The question is&para;<br>whether it includes intra-session recesses as well.&para;<br>In our view, the phrase “the recess” includes an intra­&para;<br>session recess of substantial length. Its words taken&para;<br>literally can refer to both types of recess. Founding-era&para;<br>dictionaries define the word “recess,” much as we do today,&para;<br>simply as “a period of cessation from usual work.” 13 The&para;<br>Oxford English Dictionary 322–323 (2d ed. 1989) (herein­&para;<br>after OED) (citing 18th- and 19th-century sources for that&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>definition of “recess”); 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (“[r]emission or suspension of business or procedure”); 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language 1602–1603 (4th ed. 1773)&para;<br>(hereinafter Johnson) (same). The Founders themselves&para;<br>used the word to refer to intra-session, as well as to intersession, breaks. See, e.g., 3 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 76 (M. Farrand rev. 1966) (hereinafter&para;<br>Farrand) (letter from George Washington to John Jay&para;<br>using “the recess” to refer to an intra-session break of the&para;<br>Constitutional Convention); id., at 191 (speech of Luther&para;<br>Martin with a similar usage); 1 T. Jefferson, A Manual&para;<br>of Parliamentary Practice §LI, p. 165 (2d ed. 1812) (describing a “recess by adjournment” which did not end a&para;<br>session).&para;<br>We recognize that the word “the” in “the recess” might&para;<br>suggest that the phrase refers to the single break separating formal sessions of Congress. That is because the word&para;<br>“the” frequently (but not always) indicates “a particular&para;<br>thing.” 2 Johnson 2003. But the word can also refer “to a&para;<br>term used generically or universally.” 17 OED 879. The&para;<br>Constitution, for example, directs the Senate to choose a&para;<br>President pro tempore “in the Absence of the VicePresident.” Art. I, §3, cl. 5 (emphasis added). And the&para;<br>Federalist Papers refer to the chief magistrate of an ancient Achaean league who “administered the government&para;<br>in the recess of the Senate.” The Federalist No. 18, at 113&para;<br>(J. Madison) (emphasis added). Reading “the” generically&para;<br>in this way, there is no linguistic problem applying the&para;<br>Clause’s phrase to both kinds of recess. And, in fact, the&para;<br>phrase “the recess” was used to refer to intra-session&para;<br>recesses at the time of the founding. See, e.g., 3 Farrand&para;<br>76 (letter from Washington to Jay); New Jersey LegislativeCouncil Journal, 5th Sess., 1st Sitting 70, 2d Sitting 9&para;<br>(1781) (twice referring to a 4-month, intra-session break&para;<br>as “the Recess”); see also Brief for Petitioner 14–16 (listing&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>A to opinion&para;<br>of the Court&para;<br>of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>examples).&para;<br>The constitutional text is thus ambiguous. And we&para;<br>believe the Clause’s purpose demands the broader inter­&para;<br>pretation. The Clause gives the President authority to&para;<br>make appointments during “the recess of the Senate” so&para;<br>that the President can ensure the continued functioning of&para;<br>the Federal Government when the Senate is away. The&para;<br>Senate is equally away during both an inter-session and&para;<br>an intra-session recess, and its capacity to participate in&para;<br>the appointments process has nothing to do with the&para;<br>words it uses to signal its departure.&para;<br>History also offers strong support for the broad interpre­&para;<br>tation. We concede that pre-Civil War history is not help­&para;<br>ful. But it shows only that Congress generally took long&para;<br>breaks between sessions, while taking no significant intra­&para;<br>session breaks at all (five times it took a break of a week&para;<br>or so at Christmas). See Appendix A, infra. Obviously, if&para;<br>there are no significant intra-session recesses, there will&para;<br>be no intra-session recess appointments. In 1867 and&para;<br>1868, Congress for the first time took substantial, non­&para;<br>holiday intra-session breaks, and President Andrew John­&para;<br>son made dozens of recess appointments. The Federal&para;<br>Court of Claims upheld one of those specific appointments,&para;<br>writing “[w]e have no doubt that a vacancy occurring while&para;<br>the Senate was thus temporarily adjourned” during the&para;<br>“first session of the Fortieth Congress” was “legally filled&para;<br>by appointment of the President alone.” Gould v. United&para;<br>States, 19 Ct. Cl. 593, 595–596 (1884) (emphasis added).&para;<br>Attorney General Evarts also issued three opinions con­&para;<br>cerning the constitutionality of President Johnson’s ap­&para;<br>pointments, and it apparently did not occur to him that&para;<br>the distinction between intra-session and inter-session&para;<br>recesses was significant. See 12 Op. Atty. Gen. 449 (1868);&para;<br>12 Op. Atty. Gen. 455 (1868); 12 Op. Atty. Gen. 469 (1868).&para;<br>Similarly, though the 40th Congress impeached President&para;<br>Johnson on charges relating to his appointment power, he&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was not accused of violating the Constitution by making intra-session recess appointments. Hartnett, Recess&para;<br>Appointments of Article III Judges: Three Constitutional&para;<br>Questions, 26 Cardozo L. Rev. 377, 409 (2005).&para;<br>In all, between the founding and the Great Depression,&para;<br>Congress took substantial intra-session breaks (other than&para;<br>holiday breaks) in four years: 1867, 1868, 1921, and 1929.&para;<br>Appendix A, infra. And in each of those years the President made intra-session recess appointments. See App. to&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 1a–11a.&para;<br>Since 1929, and particularly since the end of World War&para;<br>II, Congress has shortened its inter-session breaks as it&para;<br>has taken longer and more frequent intra-session breaks;&para;<br>Presidents have correspondingly made more intra-session&para;<br>recess appointments. Indeed, if we include military appointments, Presidents have made thousands of intrasession recess appointments. Id., at 11a–64a. President&para;<br>Franklin Roosevelt, for example, commissioned Dwight&para;<br>Eisenhower as a permanent Major General during an&para;<br>intra-session recess; President Truman made Dean Acheson Under Secretary of State; and President George H. W.&para;<br>Bush reappointed Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the&para;<br>Federal Reserve Board. Id., at 11a, 12a, 40a. JUSTICE&para;<br>SCALIA does not dispute any of these facts.&para;<br>Not surprisingly, the publicly available opinions of&para;<br>Presidential legal advisers that we have found are nearly&para;<br>unanimous in determining that the Clause authorizes&para;<br>these appointments. In 1921, for example, Attorney General Daugherty advised President Harding that he could&para;<br>make intra-session recess appointments. He reasoned:&para;<br>“If the President’s power of appointment is to be defeated because the Senate takes an adjournment to a&para;<br>specified date, the painful and inevitable result will be&para;<br>measurably to prevent the exercise of governmental&para;<br>functions. I can not bring myself to believe that the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Atty. Gen. 20, 23.&para;<br>We have found memoranda offering similar advice to&para;<br>President Eisenhower and to every President from Carter&para;<br>to the present. See 36 Opinion of Office of Legal Counsel&para;<br>(Op. OLC) ___, ___ (2012), online at www.justice.gov/&para;<br>olc/opiniondocslpro-forma-sessions-opinion.pdf; 25 Op.&para;<br>OLC 182 (2001); 20 Op. OLC 124, 161 (1996); 16 Op.

Gen. 463,&para;<br>466 (1960).&para;<br>We must note one contrary opinion authored by Presi­&para;<br>dent Theodore Roosevelt’s Attorney General Philander&para;<br>Knox. Knox advised the President that the Clause did not&para;<br>cover a 19–day intra-session Christmas recess. 23 Op.&para;<br>Atty. Gen. 599 (1901). But in doing so he relied heavily&para;<br>upon the use of the word “the,” a linguistic point that we&para;<br>do not find determinative. See supra, at 10. And Knox all&para;<br>but confessed that his interpretation ran contrary to the&para;<br>basic purpose of the Clause. For it would permit the&para;<br>Senate to adjourn for “several months,” to a fixed date,&para;<br>and thereby “seriously curtail the President’s power of&para;<br>making recess appointments.” 23 Op. Atty. Gen., at 603.&para;<br>Moreover, only three days before Knox gave his opinion,&para;<br>the Solicitor of the Treasury came to the opposite conclu­&para;<br>sion. Reply Brief 7, n. 5. We therefore do not think Knox’s&para;<br>isolated opinion can disturb the consensus advice within&para;<br>the Executive Branch taking the opposite position.&para;<br>What about the Senate? Since Presidents began making&para;<br>intra-session recess appointments, individual Senators&para;<br>have taken differing views about the proper definition of&para;<br>“the recess.” See, e.g., 130 Cong. Rec. 23234 (1984) (reso­&para;<br>lution introduced by Senator Byrd urging limits on the&para;<br>length of applicable intra-session recesses); Brief for Sen.&para;<br>Mitch McConnell et al. as Amici Curiae 26 (an intra­&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>session adjournment does not count as “the recess”); Brief&para;<br>for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy as Amicus Curiae in Franklin v. United States, O. T. 2004, No. 04–5858, p. 5 (same).&para;<br>But neither the Senate considered as a body nor its committees, despite opportunities to express opposition to the&para;<br>practice of intra-session recess appointments, has done so.&para;<br>Rather, to the extent that the Senate or a Senate committee has expressed a view, that view has favored a functional definition of “recess,” and a functional definition&para;<br>encompasses intra-session recesses.&para;<br>Most notably, in 1905 the Senate Committee on the&para;<br>Judiciary objected strongly to President Theodore Roosevelt’s use of the Clause to make more than 160 recess&para;<br>appointments during a “fictitious” inter-session recess.&para;<br>S. Rep. No. 4389, 58th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 2 (hereinafter&para;<br>1905 Senate Report). At noon on December 7, 1903, the&para;<br>Senate President pro tempore had “declare[d]” a formal,&para;<br>“extraordinary session” of the Senate “adjourned without&para;<br>day,” and the next formal Senate session began immediately afterwards. 37 Cong. Rec. 544 (1903). President&para;<br>Roosevelt made over 160 recess appointments during the&para;<br>instantaneous inter-session interval. The Judiciary Committee, when stating its strong objection, defined “recess”&para;<br>in functional terms as&para;<br>“the period of time when the Senate is not sitting in&para;<br>regular or extraordinary session as a branch of the&para;<br>Congress . . . ; when its members owe no duty of attendance; when its Chamber is empty; when, because&para;<br>of its absence, it can not receive communications from&para;<br>the President or participate as a body in making appointments.” 1905 Senate Report, at 2 (emphasis&para;<br>deleted).&para;<br>That functional definition encompasses intra-session, as&para;<br>well as inter-session, recesses. JUSTICE SCALIA is right&para;<br>that the 1905 Report did not specifically address the dis-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of&para;<br>of the&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>Court&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>&para;<br>tinction between inter-session and intra-session recesses.&para;<br>But the animating principle of the Report—that “recess”&para;<br>should be practically construed to mean a time when the&para;<br>Senate is unavailable to participate in the appointments&para;<br>process—is inconsistent with the formalistic approach that&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA endorses.&para;<br>Similarly, in 1940 the Senate helped to enact a law&para;<br>regulating the payment of recess appointees, and the&para;<br>Comptroller General of the United States has interpreted&para;<br>that law functionally. An earlier 1863 statute had denied&para;<br>pay to individuals appointed to fill up vacancies first&para;<br>arising prior to the beginning of a recess. The Senate&para;<br>Judiciary Committee then believed that those vacancies&para;<br>fell outside the scope of the Clause. See infra, at 30. In&para;<br>1940, however, the Senate amended the law to permit&para;<br>many of those recess appointees to be paid. Act of July 11,&para;<br>54 Stat. 751. Interpreting the amendments in 1948, the&para;<br>Comptroller General—who, unlike the Attorney General,&para;<br>is an “officer of the Legislative Branch,” Bowsher v. Synar,&para;<br>478 U. S. 714, 731 (1986)—wrote:&para;<br>“I think it is clear that [the Pay Act amendments’]&para;<br>primary purpose was to relieve ‘recess appointees’ of&para;<br>the burden of serving without compensation during&para;<br>periods when the Senate is not actually sitting and is&para;<br>not available to give its advice and consent in respect&para;<br>to the appointment, irrespective of whether the recess&para;<br>of the Senate is attributable to a final adjournment&para;<br>sine die or to an adjournment to a specified date.” 28&para;<br>Comp. Gen. 30, 37.&para;<br>We recognize that the Senate cannot easily register&para;<br>opposition as a body to every governmental action that&para;<br>many, perhaps most, Senators oppose. But the Senate has&para;<br>not been silent or passive regarding the meaning of the&para;<br>Clause: A Senate Committee did register opposition to&para;<br>President Theodore Roosevelt’s use of the Clause, and the&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Senate as a whole has legislated in an effort to discourage&para;<br>certain kinds of recess appointments. And yet we are not&para;<br>aware of any formal action it has taken to call into question the broad and functional definition of “recess” first&para;<br>set out in the 1905 Senate Report and followed by the&para;<br>Executive Branch since at least 1921. Nor has JUSTICE&para;<br>SCALIA identified any. All the while, the President has&para;<br>made countless recess appointments during intra-session&para;<br>recesses.&para;<br>The upshot is that restricting the Clause to inter-session&para;<br>recesses would frustrate its purpose. It would make the&para;<br>President’s recess-appointment power dependent on a&para;<br>formalistic distinction of Senate procedure. Moreover, the&para;<br>President has consistently and frequently interpreted the&para;<br>word “recess” to apply to intra-session recesses, and has&para;<br>acted on that interpretation. The Senate as a body has&para;<br>done nothing to deny the validity of this practice for at&para;<br>least three-quarters of a century. And three-quarters of a&para;<br>century of settled practice is long enough to entitle a&para;<br>practice to “great weight in a proper interpretation” of the&para;<br>constitutional provision. The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U. S.,&para;<br>at 689.&para;<br>We are aware of, but we are not persuaded by, three&para;<br>important arguments to the contrary. First, some argue&para;<br>that the Founders would likely have intended the Clause&para;<br>to apply only to inter-session recesses, for they hardly&para;<br>knew any other. See, e.g., Brief for Originalist Scholars as&para;<br>Amici Curiae 27–29. Indeed, from the founding until the&para;<br>Civil War inter-session recesses were the only kind of&para;<br>significant recesses that Congress took. The problem with&para;<br>this argument, however, is that it does not fully describe&para;<br>the relevant founding intent. The question is not: Did the&para;<br>Founders at the time think about intra-session recesses?&para;<br>Perhaps they did not. The question is: Did the Founders&para;<br>intend to restrict the scope of the Clause to the form of&para;<br>congressional recess then prevalent, or did they intend a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>A to opinion&para;<br>of the Court&para;<br>of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>broader scope permitting the Clause to apply, where ap­&para;<br>propriate, to somewhat changed circumstances? The&para;<br>Founders knew they were writing a document designed to&para;<br>apply to ever-changing circumstances over centuries.&para;<br>After all, a Constitution is “intended to endure for ages to&para;<br>come,” and must adapt itself to a future that can only be&para;<br>“seen dimly,” if at all. McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415. We&para;<br>therefore think the Framers likely did intend the Clause&para;<br>to apply to a new circumstance that so clearly falls within&para;<br>its essential purposes, where doing so is consistent with&para;<br>the Clause’s language.&para;<br>Second, some argue that the intra-session interpretation&para;<br>permits the President to make “illogic[ally]” long recess&para;<br>appointments. Brief for Respondent Noel Canning 13;&para;<br>post, at 10 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). A recess&para;<br>appointment made between Congress’ annual sessions&para;<br>would permit the appointee to serve for about a year, i.e.,&para;<br>until the “end” of the “next” Senate “session.” Art. II, §2,&para;<br>cl. 3. But an intra-session appointment made at the be­&para;<br>ginning or in the middle of a formal session could permit&para;<br>the appointee to serve for 1½ or almost 2 years (until the&para;<br>end of the following formal session).&para;<br>We agree that the intra-session interpretation permits&para;<br>somewhat longer recess appointments, but we do not agree&para;<br>that this consequence is “illogical.” A President who&para;<br>makes a recess appointment will often also seek to make a&para;<br>regular appointment, nominating the appointee and secur­&para;<br>ing ordinary Senate confirmation. And the Clause ensures&para;<br>that the President and Senate always have at least a full&para;<br>session to go through the nomination and confirmation&para;<br>process. That process may take several months. See&para;<br>O’Connell, Vacant Offices: Delays in Staffing Top Agency&para;<br>Positions, 82 S. Cal. L. Rev. 913, 967 (2009) (from 1987 to&para;<br>2005 the nomination and confirmation process took an&para;<br>average of 236 days for noncabinet agency heads). A&para;<br>recess appointment that lasts somewhat longer than a&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>year will ensure the President the continued assistance of&para;<br>subordinates that the Clause permits him to obtain while&para;<br>he and the Senate select a regular appointee. An appointment should last until the Senate has “an opportunity to act on the subject,” Story, §1551, at 410, and the&para;<br>Clause embodies a determination that a full session is&para;<br>needed to select and vet a replacement.&para;<br>Third, the Court of Appeals believed that application of&para;<br>the Clause to intra-session recesses would introduce&para;<br>“vagueness” into a Clause that was otherwise clear. 705&para;<br>F. 3d, at 504. One can find problems of uncertainty, however, either way. In 1867, for example, President Andrew&para;<br>Johnson called a special session of Congress, which took&para;<br>place during a lengthy intra-session recess. Consider the&para;<br>period of time that fell just after the conclusion of that&para;<br>special session. Did that period remain an intra-session&para;<br>recess, or did it become an inter-session recess? Historians disagree about the answer. Compare Hartnett, 26&para;<br>Cardozo L. Rev., at 408–409, with Brief for Constitutional&para;<br>Law Scholars as Amici Curiae 23–24.&para;<br>Or suppose that Congress adjourns sine die, but it does&para;<br>so conditionally, so that the leadership can call the members back into session when “the public interest shall&para;<br>warrant it.” E.g., 155 Cong. Rec. 33429 (2009); 152 Cong.&para;<br>Rec. 23731–23732 (2006); 150 Cong. Rec. 25925–25926&para;<br>(2004). If the Senate Majority Leader were to reconvene&para;<br>the Senate, how would we characterize the preceding&para;<br>recess? Is it still inter-session? On the narrower interpretation the label matters; on the broader it does not.&para;<br>The greater interpretive problem is determining how&para;<br>long a recess must be in order to fall within the Clause. Is&para;<br>a break of a week, or a day, or an hour too short to count&para;<br>as a “recess”? The Clause itself does not say. And&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA claims that this silence itself shows that&para;<br>the Framers intended the Clause to apply only to an intersession recess.

For one thing, the most likely reason the&para;<br>Framers did not place a textual floor underneath the word&para;<br>“recess” is that they did not foresee the need for one. They&para;<br>might have expected that the Senate would meet for a&para;<br>single session lasting at most half a year. The Federalist&para;<br>No. 84, at 596 (A. Hamilton). And they might not have&para;<br>anticipated that intra-session recesses would become&para;<br>lengthier and more significant than inter-session ones.&para;<br>The Framers’ lack of clairvoyance on that point is not&para;<br>dispositive. Unlike JUSTICE SCALIA, we think it most&para;<br>consistent with our constitutional structure to presume&para;<br>that the Framers would have allowed intra-session recess&para;<br>appointments where there was a long history of such&para;<br>practice.&para;<br>Moreover, the lack of a textual floor raises a problem&para;<br>that plagues both interpretations—JUSTICE SCALIA’s and&para;<br>ours. Today a brief inter-session recess is just as possible&para;<br>as a brief intra-session recess. And though JUSTICE&para;<br>SCALIA says that the “notion that the Constitution em­&para;<br>powers the President to make unilateral appointments&para;<br>every time the Senate takes a half-hour lunch break is so&para;<br>absurd as to be self-refuting,” he must immediately con­&para;<br>cede (in a footnote) that the President “can make recess&para;<br>appointments during any break between sessions, no&para;<br>matter how short.” Post, at 11, 15, n. 4 (emphasis added).&para;<br>Even the Solicitor General, arguing for a broader inter­&para;<br>pretation, acknowledges that there is a lower limit appli­&para;<br>cable to both kinds of recess. He argues that the lower&para;<br>limit should be three days by analogy to the Adjournments&para;<br>Clause of the Constitution. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. That&para;<br>Clause says: “Neither House, during the Session of Con­&para;<br>gress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for&para;<br>more than three days.” Art. I, §5, cl. 4.&para;<br>We agree with the Solicitor General that a 3-day recess&para;<br>would be too short.

As the Solicitor General says, it is constitutionally&para;<br>de minimis. Brief for Petitioner 18. A Senate recess that&para;<br>is so short that it does not require the consent of the&para;<br>House is not long enough to trigger the President’s recessappointment power.&para;<br>That is not to say that the President may make recess&para;<br>appointments during any recess that is “more than three&para;<br>days.” Art. I, §5, cl. 4. The Recess Appointments Clause&para;<br>seeks to permit the Executive Branch to function smoothly&para;<br>when Congress is unavailable. And though Congress has&para;<br>taken short breaks for almost 200 years, and there have&para;<br>been many thousands of recess appointments in that time,&para;<br>we have not found a single example of a recess appointment made during an intra-session recess that was&para;<br>shorter than 10 days. Nor has the Solicitor General. Reply&para;<br>Brief 23. Indeed, the Office of Legal Counsel once informally advised against making a recess appointment during a 6-day intra-session recess. 3 Op. OLC, at 315–316.&para;<br>The lack of examples suggests that the recessappointment power is not needed in that context. (The&para;<br>length of a recess is “ordinarily calculated by counting the&para;<br>calendar days running from the day after the recess begins&para;<br>and including the day the recess ends.” 36 Op. OLC, at&para;<br>___, n. 1 (citation omitted).)&para;<br>There are a few historical examples of recess appointments made during inter-session recesses shorter than 10&para;<br>days. We have already discussed President Theodore&para;<br>Roosevelt’s appointments during the instantaneous, “fictitious” recess. President Truman also made a recess appointment to the Civil Aeronautics Board during a 3-day&para;<br>inter-session recess. Hogue, Recess Appointments: Fre-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

President Taft made a&para;<br>few appointments during a 9-day recess following his&para;<br>inauguration, and President Lyndon Johnson made several appointments during an 8-day recess several weeks&para;<br>after assuming office.

There may be others of which we are unaware.&para;<br>But when considered against 200 years of settled practice,&para;<br>we regard these few scattered examples as anomalies. We&para;<br>therefore conclude, in light of historical practice, that a&para;<br>recess of more than 3 days but less than 10 days is presumptively too short to fall within the Clause. We add the&para;<br>word “presumptively” to leave open the possibility that&para;<br>some very unusual circumstance—a national catastrophe,&para;<br>for instance, that renders the Senate unavailable but calls&para;<br>for an urgent response—could demand the exercise of the&para;<br>recess-appointment power during a shorter break. (It&para;<br>should go without saying—except that JUSTICE SCALIA&para;<br>compels us to say it—that political opposition in the Senate would not qualify as an unusual circumstance.)&para;<br>In sum, we conclude that the phrase “the recess” applies&para;<br>to both intra-session and inter-session recesses. If a Senate recess is so short that it does not require the consent of&para;<br>the House, it is too short to trigger the Recess Appointments Clause. See Art. I, §5, cl. 4. And a recess lasting&para;<br>less than 10 days is presumptively too short as well.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The second question concerns the scope of the phrase&para;<br>“vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate.” Art. II, §2, cl. 3 (emphasis added). All agree that the&para;<br>phrase applies to vacancies that initially occur during a&para;<br>recess. But does it also apply to vacancies that initially&para;<br>occur before a recess and continue to exist during the&para;<br>recess? In our view the phrase applies to both kinds of&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>vacancy.&para;<br>We believe that the Clause’s language, read literally,&para;<br>permits, though it does not naturally favor, our broader&para;<br>interpretation. We concede that the most natural meaning of “happens” as applied to a “vacancy” (at least to a&para;<br>modern ear) is that the vacancy “happens” when it initially occurs. See 1 Johnson 913 (defining “happen” in&para;<br>relevant part as meaning “[t]o fall out; to chance; to come&para;<br>to pass”). But that is not the only possible way to use the&para;<br>word.&para;<br>Thomas Jefferson wrote that the Clause is “certainly&para;<br>susceptible of [two] constructions.” Letter to Wilson Cary&para;<br>Nicholas (Jan. 26, 1802), in 36 Papers of Thomas Jefferson&para;<br>433 (B. Oberg ed., 2009). It “may mean ‘vacancies that&para;<br>may happen to be’ or ‘may happen to fall’ ” during a recess.&para;<br>Ibid. Jefferson used the phrase in the first sense when he&para;<br>wrote to a job seeker that a particular position was unavailable, but that he (Jefferson) was “happy that another&para;<br>vacancy happens wherein I can . . . avail the public of your&para;<br>integrity &amp; talents,” for “the office of Treasurer of the US.&para;<br>is vacant by the resignation of mr Meredith.” Letter to&para;<br>Thomas Tudor Tucker (Oct. 31, 1801), in 35 id., at 530 (B.&para;<br>Oberg ed. 2008) (emphasis added). See also Laws Passed&para;<br>by the Legislature of Florida, No. 31, An Act to Organize&para;<br>and Regulate the Militia of the Territory of Florida §13,&para;<br>H. R. Exec. Doc. No. 72, 27th Cong., 3d Sess., 22 (1842)&para;<br>(“[W]hen any vacancy shall take place in the office of any&para;<br>lieutenant colonel, it shall be the duty of the colonel of the&para;<br>regiment in which such vacancy may happen to order an&para;<br>election to be held at the several precincts in the battalion&para;<br>in which such vacancy may happen” (emphasis added)).&para;<br>Similarly, when Attorney General William Wirt advised&para;<br>President Monroe to follow the broader interpretation, he&para;<br>wrote that the “expression seems not perfectly clear. It&para;<br>may mean ‘happen to take place:’ that is, ‘to originate,’ ” or&para;<br>it “may mean, also, without violence to the sense, ‘happen&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Gen. 631, 631–632 (1823). The&para;<br>broader interpretation, he added, is “most accordant with”&para;<br>the Constitution’s “reason and spirit.” Id., at 632.&para;<br>We can still understand this earlier use of “happen” if&para;<br>we think of it used together with another word that, like&para;<br>“vacancy,” can refer to a continuing state, say, a financial&para;<br>crisis. A statute that gives the President authority to act&para;<br>in respect to “any financial crisis that may happen during&para;<br>his term” can easily be interpreted to include crises that&para;<br>arise before, and continue during, that term. Perhaps that&para;<br>is why the Oxford English Dictionary defines “happen” in&para;<br>part as “chance to be,” rather than “chance to occur.” 6&para;<br>OED 1096 (emphasis added); see also 19 OED 383 (defin­&para;<br>ing “vacancy” as the “condition of an office or post being&para;<br>. . . vacant”).&para;<br>In any event, the linguistic question here is not whether&para;<br>the phrase can be, but whether it must be, read more&para;<br>narrowly. The question is whether the Clause is ambigu­&para;<br>ous. The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U. S., at 690. And the&para;<br>broader reading, we believe, is at least a permissible&para;<br>reading of a “ ‘doubtful’ ” phrase. Ibid. We consequently go&para;<br>on to consider the Clause’s purpose and historical practice.&para;<br>The Clause’s purpose strongly supports the broader&para;<br>interpretation. That purpose is to permit the President to&para;<br>obtain the assistance of subordinate officers when the&para;<br>Senate, due to its recess, cannot confirm them. Attorney&para;<br>General Wirt clearly described how the narrower interpre­&para;<br>tation would undermine this purpose:&para;<br>“Put the case of a vacancy occurring in an office, held&para;<br>in a distant part of the country, on the last day of the&para;<br>Senate’s session. Before the vacancy is made known&para;<br>to the President, the Senate rises. The office may be&para;<br>an important one; the vacancy may paralyze a whole&para;<br>line of action in some essential branch of our internal&para;<br>police; the public interests may imperiously demand&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that it shall be immediately filled. But the vacancy&para;<br>happened to occur during the session of the Senate;&para;<br>and if the President’s power is to be limited to such&para;<br>vacancies only as happen to occur during the recess of&para;<br>the Senate, the vacancy in the case put must continue,&para;<br>however ruinous the consequences may be to the public.” 1 Op. Atty. Gen., at 632.&para;<br>Examples are not difficult to imagine: An ambassadorial&para;<br>post falls vacant too soon before the recess begins for the&para;<br>President to appoint a replacement; the Senate rejects a&para;<br>President’s nominee just before a recess, too late to select&para;<br>another. Wirt explained that the “substantial purpose of&para;<br>the constitution was to keep these offices filled,” and “if&para;<br>the President shall not have the power to fill a vacancy&para;<br>thus circumstanced, . . . the substance of the constitution&para;<br>will be sacrificed to a dubious construction of its letter.”&para;<br>Ibid. Thus the broader construction, encompassing vacancies that initially occur before the beginning of a recess, is&para;<br>the “only construction of the constitution which is compatible with its spirit, reason, and purposes; while, at the&para;<br>same time, it offers no violence to its language.” Id., at&para;<br>633.&para;<br>We do not agree with JUSTICE SCALIA’s suggestion that&para;<br>the Framers would have accepted the catastrophe envisioned by Wirt because Congress can always provide for&para;<br>acting officers, see 5 U. S. C. §3345, and the President can&para;<br>always convene a special session of Congress, see U. S.&para;<br>Const., Art. II, §3. Acting officers may have less authority&para;<br>than Presidential appointments. 6 Op. OLC 119, 121&para;<br>(1982). Moreover, to rely on acting officers would lessen&para;<br>the President’s ability to staff the Executive Branch with&para;<br>people of his own choosing, and thereby limit the President’s control and political accountability. Cf. Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.,&para;<br>561 U. S. 477, 497–498 (2010). Special sessions are&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

The point of the Recess Appoint­&para;<br>ments Clause was to avoid reliance on these inadequate&para;<br>expedients.&para;<br>At the same time, we recognize one important purpose­&para;<br>related consideration that argues in the opposite direction.&para;<br>A broad interpretation might permit a President to avoid&para;<br>Senate confirmations as a matter of course. If the Clause&para;<br>gives the President the power to “fill up all vacancies” that&para;<br>occur before, and continue to exist during, the Senate’s&para;<br>recess, a President might not submit any nominations to&para;<br>the Senate. He might simply wait for a recess and then&para;<br>provide all potential nominees with recess appointments.&para;<br>He might thereby routinely avoid the constitutional need&para;<br>to obtain the Senate’s “advice and consent.”&para;<br>Wirt thought considerations of character and politics&para;<br>would prevent Presidents from abusing the Clause in this&para;<br>way. 1 Op. Atty. Gen., at 634. He might have added that&para;<br>such temptations should not often arise. It is often less&para;<br>desirable for a President to make a recess appointment. A&para;<br>recess appointee only serves a limited term. That, com­&para;<br>bined with the lack of Senate approval, may diminish the&para;<br>recess appointee’s ability, as a practical matter, to get a&para;<br>controversial job done. And even where the President and&para;<br>Senate are at odds over politically sensitive appointments,&para;<br>compromise is normally possible. Indeed, the 1940 Pay&para;<br>Act amendments represent a general compromise, for they&para;<br>foresee payment of salaries to recess appointees where&para;<br>vacancies occur before the recess began but not too long&para;<br>before (namely, within 30 days before).&para;<br>5 U. S. C.&para;<br>§5503(a)(1); see infra, at 32. Moreover, the Senate, like&para;<br>the President, has institutional “resources,” including&para;<br>political resources, “available to protect and assert its&para;<br>interests.” Goldwater v. Carter, 444 U. S. 996, 1004 (1979)&para;<br>(Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). In an unusual&para;<br>instance, where a matter is important enough to the Sen­&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ate, that body can remain in session, preventing recess&para;<br>appointments by refusing to take a recess. See Part V,&para;<br>infra. In any event, the Executive Branch has adhered to&para;<br>the broader interpretation for two centuries, and Senate&para;<br>confirmation has always remained the norm for officers&para;<br>that require it.&para;<br>While we concede that both interpretations carry with&para;<br>them some risk of undesirable consequences, we believe&para;<br>the narrower interpretation risks undermining constitutionally conferred powers more seriously and more often.&para;<br>It would prevent the President from making any recess&para;<br>appointment that arose before a recess, no matter who the&para;<br>official, no matter how dire the need, no matter how uncontroversial the appointment, and no matter how late in&para;<br>the session the office fell vacant. Overall, like Attorney&para;<br>General Wirt, we believe the broader interpretation more&para;<br>consistent with the Constitution’s “reason and spirit.” 1&para;<br>Op. Atty. Gen., at 632.&para;<br>Historical practice over the past 200 years strongly&para;<br>favors the broader interpretation. The tradition of applying the Clause to pre-recess vacancies dates at least to&para;<br>President James Madison. There is no undisputed record&para;<br>of Presidents George Washington, John Adams, or Thomas&para;<br>Jefferson making such an appointment, though the Solicitor General believes he has found records showing that&para;<br>Presidents Washington and Jefferson did so. We know&para;<br>that Edmund Randolph, Washington’s Attorney General,&para;<br>favored a narrow reading of the Clause. Randolph believed that the “Spirit of the Constitution favors the participation of the Senate in all appointments,” though he&para;<br>did not address—let alone answer—the powerful purposive and structural arguments subsequently made by Attorney General Wirt. See Edmund Randolph’s Opinion on&para;<br>Recess Appointments (July 7, 1792), in 24 Papers of&para;<br>Thomas Jefferson 166 (J. Catanzariti ed. 1990).&para;<br>President Adams seemed to endorse the broader view of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

See&para;<br>Letter to J. McHenry (Apr. 16, 1799), in 8 Works of John&para;<br>Adams 632–633 (C. Adams ed. 1853). His Attorney Gen­&para;<br>eral, Charles Lee, later informed Jefferson that, in the&para;<br>Adams administration, “whenever an office became vacant&para;<br>so short a time before Congress rose, as not to give an&para;<br>opportunity of enquiring for a proper character, they let it&para;<br>lie always till recess.” 36 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 433.&para;<br>We know that President Jefferson thought that the broad&para;<br>interpretation was linguistically supportable, though his&para;<br>actual practice is not clear. But the evidence suggests&para;<br>that James Madison—as familiar as anyone with the&para;<br>workings of the Constitutional Convention—appointed&para;<br>Theodore Gaillard to replace a district judge who had left&para;<br>office before a recess began. Hartnett, 26 Cardozo L. Rev.,&para;<br>at 400–401. It also appears that in 1815 Madison signed a&para;<br>bill that created two new offices prior to a recess which he&para;<br>then filled later during the recess. See Act of Mar. 3, ch.&para;<br>95, 3 Stat. 235; S. J. 13th Cong., 3d Sess., 689–690 (1815);&para;<br>3 S. Exec. J. 19 (1828) (for Monday, Jan. 8, 1816). He also&para;<br>made recess appointments to “territorial” United States&para;<br>attorney and marshal positions, both of which had been&para;<br>created when the Senate was in session more than two&para;<br>years before. Act of Feb. 27, 1813, ch. 35, 2 Stat. 806; 3 S.&para;<br>Exec. J. 19. JUSTICE SCALIA refers to “written evidence of&para;<br>Madison’s own beliefs,” post, at 36, but in fact we have no&para;<br>direct evidence of what President Madison believed. We&para;<br>only know that he declined to make one appointment to a&para;<br>pre-recess vacancy after his Secretary of War advised him&para;<br>that he lacked the power. On the other hand, he did&para;<br>apparently make at least five other appointments to pre­&para;<br>recess vacancies, as JUSTICE SCALIA does not dispute.&para;<br>The next President, James Monroe, received and pre­&para;<br>sumably acted upon Attorney General Wirt’s advice,&para;<br>namely that “all vacancies which, from any casualty,&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>happen to exist at a time when the Senate cannot be&para;<br>consulted as to filling them, may be temporarily filled by&para;<br>the President.” 1 Op. Atty. Gen., at 633. Nearly every&para;<br>subsequent Attorney General to consider the question&para;<br>throughout the Nation’s history has thought the same.&para;<br>E.g., 2 Op. Atty. Gen. 525, 528 (1832); 7 Op. Atty. Gen.&para;<br>186, 223 (1855); 10 Op. Atty. Gen. 356, 356–357 (1862); 12&para;<br>Op. Atty. Gen. 32, 33 (1866); 12 Op. Atty. Gen., at 452; 14&para;<br>Op. Atty.

Indeed, as early as 1862, Attorney General Bates advised President Lincoln that his power to fill&para;<br>pre-recess vacancies was “settled . . . as far . . . as a constitutional question can be settled,” 10 Op. Atty. Gen., at&para;<br>356, and a century later Acting Attorney General Walsh&para;<br>gave President Eisenhower the same advice “without any&para;<br>doubt,” 41 Op. Atty.

The Congressional Research&para;<br>Service is “unaware of any official source of information&para;<br>tracking the dates of vacancies in federal offices.” The&para;<br>Noel Canning Decision 3, n. 6. Nonetheless, we have&para;<br>enough information to believe that the Presidents since&para;<br>Madison have made many recess appointments filling&para;<br>vacancies that initially occurred prior to a recess. As we&para;<br>have just said, nearly every 19th- and 20th-century Attorney General expressing a view on the matter has agreed&para;<br>with William Wirt, and Presidents tend to follow the legal&para;<br>advice of their chief legal officers. Moreover, the Solicitor&para;<br>General has compiled a list of 102 (mostly uncontested)&para;<br>recess appointments made by Presidents going back to the&para;<br>founding. App. to Brief for Petitioner 65a–89a. Given the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

No one disputes that every President since&para;<br>James Buchanan has made recess appointments to pre­&para;<br>existing vacancies.&para;<br>Common sense also suggests that many recess appoin­&para;<br>tees filled vacancies that arose before the recess began.&para;<br>We have compared the list of intra-session recess ap­&para;<br>pointments in the Solicitor General’s brief with the chart&para;<br>of congressional recesses. Where a specific date of ap­&para;<br>pointment can be ascertained, more than half of those&para;<br>intra-session appointments were made within two weeks&para;<br>of the beginning of a recess. That short window strongly&para;<br>suggests that many of the vacancies initially arose prior to&para;<br>the recess. See App. to Brief for Petitioner 1a–64a; Ap­&para;<br>pendix A, infra. Thus, it is not surprising that the Con­&para;<br>gressional Research Service, after examining the vacancy&para;<br>dates associated with a random sample of 24 inter-session&para;<br>recess appointments since 1981, concluded that “[i]n most&para;<br>of the 24 cases, the preponderance of evidence indicated&para;<br>that the vacancy arose prior to the recess during which the&para;<br>appointment was made.” The Noel Canning Decision 3.&para;<br>Further, with research assistance from the Supreme Court&para;<br>Library, we have examined a random sample of the recess&para;<br>appointments made by our two most recent Presidents,&para;<br>and have found that almost all of those appointments&para;<br>filled pre-recess vacancies: Of a sample of 21 recess ap­&para;<br>pointments, 18 filled pre-recess vacancies and only 1 filled&para;<br>a vacancy that arose during the recess in which he was&para;<br>appointed. The precise date on which 2 of the vacancies&para;<br>arose could not be determined. See Appendix B, infra.&para;<br>Taken together, we think it is a fair inference that a large&para;<br>proportion of the recess appointments in the history of the&para;<br>Nation have filled pre-existing vacancies.&para;<br>Did the Senate object? Early on, there was some spo­&para;<br>radic disagreement with the broad interpretation. In 1814&para;<br>&para;<br>30&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Senator Gore said that if “the vacancy happen at another&para;<br>time, it is not the case described by the Constitution.” 26&para;<br>Annals of Cong. 653. In 1822 a Senate committee, while&para;<br>focusing on the President’s power to fill a new vacancy&para;<br>created by statute, used language to the same effect. 38&para;<br>id., at 489, 500. And early Congresses enacted statutes&para;<br>authorizing certain recess appointments, see post, at 31, a&para;<br>fact that may or may not suggest they accepted the narrower interpretation of the Clause. Most of those statutes—including the one passed by the First Congress—&para;<br>authorized appointments to newly created offices, and may&para;<br>have been addressed to the separate question of whether&para;<br>new offices are vacancies within the meaning of the&para;<br>Clause. See Letter from Alexander Hamilton to James&para;<br>McHenry (May 3, 1799), in 23 Papers of Alexander Hamilton 94 (H. Syrett ed. 1976) (“Vacancy is a relative term,&para;<br>and presupposes that the Office has been once filled”);&para;<br>Reply Brief 17. In any event, by 1862 Attorney General&para;<br>Bates could still refer to “the unbroken acquiescence of the&para;<br>Senate” in support of the broad interpretation. 10 Op.&para;<br>Atty. Gen., at 356.&para;<br>Then in 1863 the Senate Judiciary Committee disagreed&para;<br>with the broad interpretation. It issued a report concluding that a vacancy “must have its inceptive point after one&para;<br>session has closed and before another session has begun.”&para;<br>S. Rep. No. 80, 37th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 3. And the Senate&para;<br>then passed the Pay Act, which provided that “no money&para;<br>shall be paid . . . as a salary, to any person appointed&para;<br>during the recess of the Senate, to fill a vacancy . . . which&para;<br>. . . existed while the Senate was in session.” Act of Feb. 9,&para;<br>1863, §2, 12 Stat. 646. Relying upon the floor statement of&para;<br>a single Senator, JUSTICE SCALIA suggests that the passage of the Pay Act indicates that the Senate as a whole&para;<br>endorsed the position in the 1863 Report. But the circumstances are more equivocal. During the floor debate on the&para;<br>bill, not a single Senator referred to the Report. Cong.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Indeed, Sena­&para;<br>tor Trumbull, who introduced the Pay Act, acknowledged&para;<br>that there was disagreement about the underlying consti­&para;<br>tutional question. Id., at 565 (“[S]ome other persons think&para;<br>he has that power”). Further, if a majority of the Senate&para;<br>had believed appointments to pre-recess vacancies were&para;<br>unconstitutional, it could have attempted to do far more&para;<br>than temporarily dock the appointees’ pay. Cf. Tenure of&para;<br>Office Act of 1867, §5, 14 Stat. 431 (making it a federal&para;<br>crime for “any person” to “accept any appointment” in&para;<br>certain circumstances).&para;<br>In any event, the Senate subsequently abandoned its&para;<br>hostility. In the debate preceding the 1905 Senate Report&para;<br>regarding President Roosevelt’s “constructive” recess&para;<br>appointments, Senator Tillman—who chaired the Com­&para;<br>mittee that authored the 1905 Report—brought up the&para;<br>1863 Report, and another Senator responded: “Whatever&para;<br>that report may have said in 1863, I do not think that has&para;<br>been the view the Senate has taken” of the issue. 38 Cong.&para;<br>Rec. 1606 (1904). Senator Tillman then agreed that “the&para;<br>Senate has acquiesced” in the President’s “power to fill”&para;<br>pre-recess vacancies. Ibid. And Senator Tillman’s 1905&para;<br>Report described the Clause’s purpose in terms closely&para;<br>echoing Attorney General Wirt. 1905 Senate Report, at 2&para;<br>(“Its sole purpose was to render it certain that at all times&para;<br>there should be, whether the Senate was in session or not,&para;<br>an officer for every office” (emphasis added)).&para;<br>In 1916 the Senate debated whether to pay a recess&para;<br>appointee who had filled a pre-recess vacancy and had not&para;<br>subsequently been confirmed. Both Senators to address&para;<br>the question—one on each side of the payment debate—&para;<br>agreed that the President had the constitutional power to&para;<br>make the appointment, and the Senate voted to pay the&para;<br>appointee for his service. 53 Cong. Rec. 4291–4299; 39&para;<br>Stat. 818–819. In 1927 the Comptroller General, a legisla­&para;<br>tive officer, wrote that “there is no question but that the&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>President has authority to make a recess appointment to&para;<br>fill any vacancy,” including those that “existed while the&para;<br>Senate was in session.” 7 Comp. Gen. 10, 11 (emphasis&para;<br>added). Meanwhile, Presidents continued to make appointments to pre-recess vacancies. The Solicitor General&para;<br>has identified 40 between 1863 and 1940, but that number&para;<br>is clearly not comprehensive. See, e.g., 32 Op. Atty. Gen.&para;<br>271–272 (1920) (listing 5 appointments that are not in the&para;<br>Solicitor General’s appendix); Recess Appointments,&para;<br>Washington Post, July 7, 1880, p. 1 (noting that President&para;<br>Hayes had made “quite a number of appointments” to prerecess vacancies).&para;<br>Then in 1940 Congress amended the Pay Act to authorize salary payments (with some exceptions) where (1) the&para;<br>“vacancy arose within thirty days prior to the termination&para;<br>of the session,” (2) “at the termination of the session” a&para;<br>nomination was “pending,” or (3) a nominee was “rejected&para;<br>by the Senate within thirty days prior to the termination&para;<br>of the session.” Act of July 11, 54 Stat. 751 (codified, as&para;<br>amended, at 5 U. S. C. §5503). All three circumstances&para;<br>concern a vacancy that did not initially occur during a&para;<br>recess but happened to exist during that recess. By paying salaries to this kind of recess appointee, the 1940&para;<br>Senate (and later Senates) in effect supported the President’s interpretation of the Clause.&para;<br>The upshot is that the President has consistently and&para;<br>frequently interpreted the Recess Appointments Clause to&para;<br>apply to vacancies that initially occur before, but continue&para;<br>to exist during, a recess of the Senate. The Senate as a&para;<br>body has not countered this practice for nearly threequarters of a century, perhaps longer. See A. Amar, The&para;<br>Unwritten Constitution 576–577, n. 16 (2012) (for nearly&para;<br>200 years “the overwhelming mass of actual practice”&para;<br>supports the President’s interpretation); Mistretta v.&para;<br>United States, 488 U. S. 361, 401 (1989) (a “200–year&para;<br>tradition” can “ ‘give meaning’ to the Constitution” (quot-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

The Pocket Veto Case,&para;<br>279 U. S., at 690. And we are reluctant to upset this&para;<br>traditional practice where doing so would seriously shrink&para;<br>the authority that Presidents have believed existed and&para;<br>have exercised for so long.&para;<br>In light of some linguistic ambiguity, the basic purpose&para;<br>of the Clause, and the historical practice we have described, we conclude that the phrase “all vacancies” includes vacancies that come into existence while the Senate&para;<br>is in session.&para;<br>V&para;<br>The third question concerns the calculation of the length&para;<br>of the Senate’s “recess.” On December 17, 2011, the Senate by unanimous consent adopted a resolution to convene&para;<br>“pro forma session[s]” only, with “no business . . . transacted,” on every Tuesday and Friday from December 20,&para;<br>2011, through January 20, 2012. 2011 S. J. 923. At the&para;<br>end of each pro forma session, the Senate would “adjourn&para;<br>until” the following pro forma session. Ibid. During that&para;<br>period, the Senate convened and adjourned as agreed. It&para;<br>held pro forma sessions on December 20, 23, 27, and 30,&para;<br>and on January 3, 6, 10, 13, 17, and 20; and at the end of&para;<br>each pro forma session, it adjourned until the time and&para;<br>date of the next. Id., at 923–924; 158 Cong. Rec. S1–S11.&para;<br>The President made the recess appointments before us&para;<br>on January 4, 2012, in between the January 3 and the&para;<br>January 6 pro forma sessions. We must determine the&para;<br>significance of these sessions—that is, whether, for purposes of the Clause, we should treat them as periods when&para;<br>the Senate was in session or as periods when it was in&para;<br>recess. If the former, the period between January 3 and&para;<br>January 6 was a 3-day recess, which is too short to trigger&para;<br>&para;<br>34&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the President’s recess-appointment power, see supra, at&para;<br>19–21. If the latter, however, then the 3-day period was&para;<br>part of a much longer recess during which the President&para;<br>did have the power to make recess appointments, see ibid.&para;<br>The Solicitor General argues that we must treat the&para;<br>pro forma sessions as periods of recess. He says that these&para;<br>“sessions” were sessions in name only because the Senate&para;<br>was in recess as a functional matter. The Senate, he&para;<br>contends, remained in a single, unbroken recess from&para;<br>January 3, when the second session of the 112th Congress&para;<br>began by operation of the Twentieth Amendment, until&para;<br>January 23, when the Senate reconvened to do regular&para;<br>business.&para;<br>In our view, however, the pro forma sessions count as&para;<br>sessions, not as periods of recess. We hold that, for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is in&para;<br>session when it says it is, provided that, under its own&para;<br>rules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate business.&para;<br>The Senate met that standard here.&para;<br>The standard we apply is consistent with the Constitution’s broad delegation of authority to the Senate to determine how and when to conduct its business. The Constitution explicitly empowers the Senate to “determine the&para;<br>Rules of its Proceedings.” Art. I, §5, cl. 2. And we have&para;<br>held that “all matters of method are open to the determination” of the Senate, as long as there is “a reasonable&para;<br>relation between the mode or method of proceeding established by the rule and the result which is sought to be&para;<br>attained” and the rule does not “ignore constitutional&para;<br>restraints or violate fundamental rights.” United States v.&para;<br>Ballin, 144 U. S. 1, 5 (1892).&para;<br>In addition, the Constitution provides the Senate with&para;<br>extensive control over its schedule. There are only limited&para;<br>exceptions. See Amdt. 20, §2 (Congress must meet once a&para;<br>year on January 3, unless it specifies another day by law);&para;<br>Art. II, §3 (Senate must meet if the President calls it into&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>35&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>A to opinion&para;<br>of the Court&para;<br>of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>special session); Art. I, §5, cl. 4 (neither House may ad­&para;<br>journ for more than three days without consent of the&para;<br>other). See also Art. II, §3 (“[I]n Case of Disagreement&para;<br>between [the Houses], with Respect to the Time of Ad­&para;<br>journment, [the President] may adjourn them to such&para;<br>Time as he shall think proper”). The Constitution thus&para;<br>gives the Senate wide latitude to determine whether and&para;<br>when to have a session, as well as how to conduct the&para;<br>session. This suggests that the Senate’s determination&para;<br>about what constitutes a session should merit great&para;<br>respect.&para;<br>Furthermore, this Court’s precedents reflect the breadth&para;<br>of the power constitutionally delegated to the Senate. We&para;<br>generally take at face value the Senate’s own report of its&para;<br>actions. When, for example, “the presiding officers” of the&para;<br>House and Senate sign an enrolled bill (and the President&para;<br>“approve[s]” it), “its authentication as a bill that has&para;<br>passed Congress should be deemed complete and unim­&para;<br>peachable.” Marshall Field &amp; Co. v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649,&para;<br>672 (1892). By the same principle, when the Journal of&para;<br>the Senate indicates that a quorum was present, under a&para;<br>valid Senate rule, at the time the Senate passed a bill, we&para;<br>will not consider an argument that a quorum was not, in&para;<br>fact, present. Ballin, supra, at 9. The Constitution re­&para;<br>quires the Senate to keep its Journal, Art. I, §5, cl. 3&para;<br>(“Each House shall keep a Journal of its proceedings . . .”),&para;<br>and “if reference may be had to” it, “it must be assumed to&para;<br>speak the truth,” Ballin, supra, at 4.&para;<br>For these reasons, we conclude that we must give great&para;<br>weight to the Senate’s own determination of when it is and&para;<br>when it is not in session. But our deference to the Senate&para;<br>cannot be absolute. When the Senate is without the capacity to act, under its own rules, it is not in session even&para;<br>if it so declares. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 69 (acknowledgment&para;<br>by counsel for amici Senators that if the Senate had left&para;<br>the Capitol and “effectively given up . . . the business of&para;<br>&para;<br>36&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>legislating” then it might be in recess, even if it said it was&para;<br>not). In that circumstance, the Senate is not simply unlikely or unwilling to act upon nominations of the President. It is unable to do so. The purpose of the Clause is to&para;<br>ensure the continued functioning of the Federal Government while the Senate is unavailable. See supra, at 5–6.&para;<br>This purpose would count for little were we to treat the&para;<br>Senate as though it were in session even when it lacks the&para;<br>ability to provide its “advice and consent.” Art. II, §2, cl. 2.&para;<br>Accordingly, we conclude that when the Senate declares&para;<br>that it is in session and possesses the capacity, under its&para;<br>own rules, to conduct business, it is in session for purposes&para;<br>of the Clause.&para;<br>Applying this standard, we find that the pro forma&para;<br>sessions were sessions for purposes of the Clause. First,&para;<br>the Senate said it was in session. The Journal of the&para;<br>Senate and the Congressional Record indicate that the&para;<br>Senate convened for a series of twice-weekly “sessions”&para;<br>from December 20 through January 20. 2011 S. J. 923–&para;<br>924; 158 Cong. Rec. S1–S11. (The Journal of the Senate&para;<br>for 2012 has not yet been published.) And these reports of&para;<br>the Senate “must be assumed to speak the truth.” Ballin,&para;<br>supra, at 4.&para;<br>Second, the Senate’s rules make clear that during its&para;<br>pro forma sessions, despite its resolution that it would&para;<br>conduct no business, the Senate retained the power to&para;<br>conduct business. During any pro forma session, the&para;<br>Senate could have conducted business simply by passing a&para;<br>unanimous consent agreement. See Riddick’s 1313. The&para;<br>Senate in fact conducts much of its business through&para;<br>unanimous consent. Id., at 1311–1312. Senate rules&para;<br>presume that a quorum is present unless a present Senator questions it. Id., at 1041–1042. And when the Senate&para;<br>has a quorum, an agreement is unanimously passed if,&para;<br>upon its proposal, no present Senator objects. Id., at&para;<br>1329–1330. It is consequently unsurprising that the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>37&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>A to opinion&para;<br>of the Court&para;<br>of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Senate has enacted legislation during pro forma sessions&para;<br>even when it has said that no business will be transacted.&para;<br>Indeed, the Senate passed a bill by unanimous consent&para;<br>during the second pro forma session after its December 17&para;<br>adjournment. 2011 S. J. 924. And that bill quickly be­&para;<br>came law. Pub. L. 112–78, 125 Stat. 1280.&para;<br>By way of contrast, we do not see how the Senate could&para;<br>conduct business during a recess. It could terminate the&para;<br>recess and then, when in session, pass a bill. But in that&para;<br>case, of course, the Senate would no longer be in recess. It&para;<br>would be in session. And that is the crucial point. Senate&para;<br>rules make clear that, once in session, the Senate can act&para;<br>even if it has earlier said that it would not.&para;<br>The Solicitor General argues that more is required. He&para;<br>contends that what counts is not the Senate’s capacity to&para;<br>conduct business but what the Senate actually does (or&para;<br>here, did) during its pro forma sessions. And he looks for&para;<br>support to the functional definition of “recess” set forth in&para;<br>the 1905 Senate Report discussed above. See supra, at 14.&para;<br>That Report describes a “recess” of the Senate as&para;<br>“the period of time . . . when its members owe no duty&para;<br>of attendance; when its Chamber is empty; when, be­&para;<br>cause of its absence, it can not receive communica­&para;<br>tions from the President or participate as a body in&para;<br>making appointments.” 1905 Senate Report, at 2.&para;<br>Even were we, for argument’s sake, to accept all of these&para;<br>criteria as authoritative, they would here be met. Taking&para;<br>the last criterion first, could the Senate, during its pro&para;<br>forma sessions, “participate as a body in making appoint­&para;<br>ments”? It could. It could confirm nominees by unani­&para;<br>mous consent, just as it passed the bill mentioned above.&para;<br>See Riddick’s 1313.&para;<br>Could the Senate “receive communications from the&para;<br>President”? It could. The Congressional Record indicates&para;<br>that the Senate “received” a message from the President&para;<br>&para;<br>38&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>on January 12, during a 3-day adjournment between two&para;<br>pro forma sessions. See 158 Cong. Rec. S37 (Jan. 23,&para;<br>2012). If the Senate could receive Presidential messages&para;<br>between two pro forma sessions, it could receive them&para;<br>during a pro forma session.&para;<br>Was the Senate’s Chamber “empty”? It was not. By its&para;<br>official rules, the Senate operates under the presumption&para;<br>that a quorum is present until a present Senator suggests&para;<br>the absence of a quorum, Riddick’s 1041–1042, and nothing in the Journal of the Senate or the Congressional&para;<br>Record reflects any such suggestion.&para;<br>Did Senators “owe [a] duty of attendance”? They did.&para;<br>The Senate’s rules dictate that Senators are under a duty&para;<br>to attend every session. See Riddick’s 214; Standing Rule&para;<br>of the Senate VI(2), S. Doc. No. 112–1, p. 5 (2011) (“No&para;<br>Senator shall absent himself from the service of the Senate without leave”). Nothing excused the Senators from&para;<br>this duty during the Senate’s pro forma sessions. If any&para;<br>present Senator had raised a question as to the presence&para;<br>of a quorum, and by roll call it had become clear that a&para;<br>quorum was missing, the Senators in attendance could&para;<br>have directed the Sergeant at Arms to bring in the missing&para;<br>Senators. Rule VI(4).&para;<br>The Solicitor General asks us to engage in a more realistic appraisal of what the Senate actually did. He argues&para;<br>that, during the relevant pro forma sessions, business was&para;<br>not in fact conducted; messages from the President could&para;<br>not be received in any meaningful way because they could&para;<br>not be placed before the Senate; the Senate Chamber was,&para;<br>according to C-SPAN coverage, almost empty; and in&para;<br>practice attendance was not required. See Brief for Petitioner 48–49, 54–55.&para;<br>We do not believe, however, that engaging in the kind of&para;<br>factual appraisal that the Solicitor General suggests is&para;<br>either legally or practically appropriate. From a legal&para;<br>perspective, this approach would run contrary to prece-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Field, 143 U. S., at&para;<br>672; see Ballin, 144 U. S., at 4. From a practical perspective, judges cannot easily determine such matters as who&para;<br>is, and who is not, in fact present on the floor during a&para;<br>particular Senate session. Judicial efforts to engage in&para;<br>these kinds of inquiries would risk undue judicial interference with the functioning of the Legislative Branch.&para;<br>Finally, the Solicitor General warns that our holding&para;<br>may “ ‘disrup[t] the proper balance between the coordinate&para;<br>branches by preventing the Executive Branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions.’ ”&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 64 (quoting Morrison v. Olson, 487&para;<br>U. S. 654, 695 (1988); alteration in original). We do not&para;<br>see, however, how our holding could significantly alter the&para;<br>constitutional balance. Most appointments are not controversial and do not produce friction between the branches.&para;<br>Where political controversy is serious, the Senate unquestionably has other methods of preventing recess appointments. As the Solicitor General concedes, the Senate&para;<br>could preclude the President from making recess appointments by holding a series of twice-a-week ordinary (not&para;<br>pro forma) sessions. And the nature of the business conducted at those ordinary sessions—whether, for example,&para;<br>Senators must vote on nominations, or may return to&para;<br>their home States to meet with their constituents—is a&para;<br>matter for the Senate to decide. The Constitution also&para;<br>gives the President (if he has enough allies in Congress) a&para;<br>way to force a recess. Art. II, §3 (“[I]n Case of Disagreement between [the Houses], with Respect to the Time of&para;<br>Adjournment, [the President] may adjourn them to such&para;<br>Time as he shall think proper”). Moreover, the President&para;<br>and Senators engage with each other in many different&para;<br>ways and have a variety of methods of encouraging each&para;<br>other to accept their points of view.&para;<br>&para;<br>40&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Regardless, the Recess Appointments Clause is not&para;<br>designed to overcome serious institutional friction. It&para;<br>simply provides a subsidiary method for appointing officials when the Senate is away during a recess. Here, as in&para;<br>other contexts, friction between the branches is an inevitable consequence of our constitutional structure. See&para;<br>Myers, 272 U. S., at 293 (Brandeis, J., dissenting). That&para;<br>structure foresees resolution not only through judicial&para;<br>interpretation and compromise among the branches but&para;<br>also by the ballot box.&para;<br>VI&para;<br>The Recess Appointments Clause responds to a structural difference between the Executive and Legislative&para;<br>Branches: The Executive Branch is perpetually in operation, while the Legislature only acts in intervals separated&para;<br>by recesses. The purpose of the Clause is to allow the&para;<br>Executive to continue operating while the Senate is unavailable. We believe that the Clause’s text, standing&para;<br>alone, is ambiguous. It does not resolve whether the&para;<br>President may make appointments during intra-session&para;<br>recesses, or whether he may fill pre-recess vacancies. But&para;<br>the broader reading better serves the Clause’s structural&para;<br>function. Moreover, that broader reading is reinforced by&para;<br>centuries of history, which we are hesitant to disturb. We&para;<br>thus hold that the Constitution empowers the President to&para;<br>fill any existing vacancy during any recess—intra-session&para;<br>or inter-session—of sufficient length.&para;<br>JUSTICE SCALIA would render illegitimate thousands of&para;<br>recess appointments reaching all the way back to the&para;<br>founding era. More than that: Calling the Clause an&para;<br>“anachronism,” he would basically read it out of the Constitution. Post, at 12.

According to Article I, section 5 of the U. S. Constitution, neither house&para;<br>may adjourn for more than three days without the consent of the other.

S. Const., Art. II,&para;<br>§2, cl. 2. That general rule is subject to an exception: “The&para;<br>President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that&para;<br>may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting&para;<br>Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next&para;<br>Session.” Id., §2, cl. 3. This case requires us to decide&para;<br>whether the Recess Appointments Clause authorized three&para;<br>appointments made by President Obama to the National&para;<br>Labor Relations Board in January 2012 without the Sen­&para;<br>ate’s consent.&para;<br>To prevent the President’s recess-appointment power&para;<br>from nullifying the Senate’s role in the appointment pro­&para;<br>cess, the Constitution cabins that power in two significant&para;<br>ways. First, it may be exercised only in “the Recess of the&para;<br>Senate,” that is, the intermission between two formal&para;<br>legislative sessions. Second, it may be used to fill only&para;<br>those vacancies that “happen during the Recess,” that is,&para;<br>offices that become vacant during that intermission. Both&para;<br>conditions are clear from the Constitution’s text and struc­&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>ture, and both were well understood at the founding. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals correctly held that the appointments&para;<br>here at issue are invalid because they did not meet either&para;<br>condition.&para;<br>Today’s Court agrees that the appointments were in­&para;<br>valid, but for the far narrower reason that they were made&para;<br>during a 3-day break in the Senate’s session. On its way&para;<br>to that result, the majority sweeps away the key textual&para;<br>limitations on the recess-appointment power. It holds,&para;<br>first, that the President can make appointments without&para;<br>the Senate’s participation even during short breaks in the&para;<br>middle of the Senate’s session, and second, that those&para;<br>appointments can fill offices that became vacant long&para;<br>before the break in which they were filled. The majority&para;<br>justifies those atextual results on an adverse-possession&para;<br>theory of executive authority: Presidents have long&para;<br>claimed the powers in question, and the Senate has not&para;<br>disputed those claims with sufficient vigor, so the Court&para;<br>should not “upset the compromises and working arrange­&para;<br>ments that the elected branches of Government them­&para;<br>selves have reached.” Ante, at 9.&para;<br>The Court’s decision transforms the recess-appointment&para;<br>power from a tool carefully designed to fill a narrow and&para;<br>specific need into a weapon to be wielded by future Presi­&para;<br>dents against future Senates. To reach that result, the&para;<br>majority casts aside the plain, original meaning of the&para;<br>constitutional text in deference to late-arising historical&para;<br>practices that are ambiguous at best. The majority’s&para;<br>insistence on deferring to the Executive’s untenably broad&para;<br>interpretation of the power is in clear conflict with our&para;<br>precedent and forebodes a diminution of this Court’s role&para;<br>in controversies involving the separation of powers and&para;<br>the structure of government. I concur in the judgment&para;<br>only.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>I. Our Responsibility&para;<br>Today’s majority disregards two overarching principles&para;<br>that ought to guide our consideration of the questions&para;<br>presented here.&para;<br>First, the Constitution’s core, government-structuring&para;<br>provisions are no less critical to preserving liberty than&para;<br>are the later adopted provisions of the Bill of Rights.&para;<br>Indeed, “[s]o convinced were the Framers that liberty of&para;<br>the person inheres in structure that at first they did not&para;<br>consider a Bill of Rights necessary.” Clinton v. City of&para;<br>New York, 524 U. S. 417, 450 (1998) (KENNEDY, J., concur­&para;<br>ring). Those structural provisions reflect the founding&para;<br>generation’s deep conviction that “checks and balances&para;<br>were the foundation of a structure of government that&para;<br>would protect liberty.” Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714,&para;<br>722 (1986). It is for that reason that “the claims of indi­&para;<br>viduals—not of Government departments—have been the&para;<br>principal source of judicial decisions concerning separation&para;<br>of powers and checks and balances.” Bond v. United&para;<br>States, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10); see, e.g.,&para;<br>Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting&para;<br>Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. 477 (2010); Clinton, supra; Plaut&para;<br>v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S. 211 (1995); Bowsher,&para;<br>supra; INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919 (1983); Northern&para;<br>Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U. S.&para;<br>50 (1982). Those decisions all rest on the bedrock princi­&para;<br>ple that “the constitutional structure of our Government”&para;<br>is designed first and foremost not to look after the inter­&para;<br>ests of the respective branches, but to “protec[t] individual&para;<br>liberty.” Bond, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11).&para;<br>Second and relatedly, when questions involving the&para;<br>Constitution’s government-structuring provisions are&para;<br>presented in a justiciable case, it is the solemn responsibil­&para;<br>ity of the Judicial Branch “ ‘to say what the law is.’ ” Zivo­&para;<br>tofsky v. Clinton, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7)&para;<br>(quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803)).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>This Court does not defer to the other branches’ resolution&para;<br>of such controversies; as JUSTICE KENNEDY has previously&para;<br>written, our role is in no way “lessened” because it might&para;<br>be said that “the two political branches are adjusting their&para;<br>own powers between themselves.” Clinton, supra, at 449&para;<br>(concurring opinion). Since the separation of powers exists&para;<br>for the protection of individual liberty, its vitality “does&para;<br>not depend” on “whether ‘the encroached-upon branch&para;<br>approves the encroachment.’ ”&para;<br>Free Enterprise Fund,&para;<br>supra, at 497 (quoting New York v. United States, 505&para;<br>U. S. 144, 182 (1992)); see also Freytag v. Commissioner,&para;<br>501 U. S. 868, 879–880 (1991); Metropolitan Washington&para;<br>Airports Authority v. Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft&para;<br>Noise, Inc., 501 U. S. 252, 276–277 (1991). Rather, polic­&para;<br>ing the “enduring structure” of constitutional government&para;<br>when the political branches fail to do so is “one of the most&para;<br>vital functions of this Court.” Public Citizen v. Depart­&para;<br>ment of Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 468 (1989) (KENNEDY, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment).&para;<br>Our decision in Chadha illustrates that principle.&para;<br>There, we held that a statutory provision authorizing one&para;<br>House of Congress to cancel an executive action taken&para;<br>pursuant to statutory authority—a so-called “legislative&para;<br>veto”—exceeded the bounds of Congress’s authority under&para;<br>the Constitution. 462 U. S., at 957–959. We did not hesi­&para;<br>tate to hold the legislative veto unconstitutional even&para;<br>though Congress had enacted, and the President had&para;<br>signed, nearly 300 similar provisions over the course of 50&para;<br>years. Id., at 944–945. Just the opposite: We said the&para;<br>other branches’ enthusiasm for the legislative veto “sharp­&para;<br>ened rather than blunted” our review. Id., at 944. Like­&para;<br>wise, when the charge is made that a practice “enhances&para;<br>the President’s powers beyond” what the Constitution&para;<br>permits, “[i]t is no answer . . . to say that Congress sur­&para;<br>rendered its authority by its own hand.” Clinton, 524&para;<br>U. S., at 451 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). “[O]ne Congress&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>cannot yield up its own powers, much less those of other&para;<br>Congresses to follow. Abdication of responsibility is not&para;<br>part of the constitutional design.” Id., at 452 (citations&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>Of course, where a governmental practice has been&para;<br>open, widespread, and unchallenged since the early days&para;<br>of the Republic, the practice should guide our interpreta­&para;<br>tion of an ambiguous constitutional provision. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 743–744 (1999); Bowsher,&para;<br>supra, at 723–724; Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52,&para;<br>174–175 (1926); see also Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v.&para;<br>Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 610 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concur­&para;<br>ring) (arguing that “a systematic, unbroken, executive&para;<br>practice, long pursued to the knowledge of the Congress&para;<br>and never before questioned” should inform interpretation&para;<br>of the “Executive Power” vested in the President); Rutan v.&para;<br>Republican Party of Ill., 497 U. S. 62, 95, and n. 1 (1990)&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., dissenting). But “ ‘[p]ast practice does not, by&para;<br>itself, create power.’ ” Medellín v. Texas, 552 U. S. 491,&para;<br>532 (2008) (quoting Dames &amp; Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S.&para;<br>654, 686 (1981)). That is a necessary corollary of the&para;<br>principle that the political branches cannot by agreement&para;<br>alter the constitutional structure. Plainly, then, a self­&para;<br>aggrandizing practice adopted by one branch well after the&para;<br>founding, often challenged, and never before blessed by&para;<br>this Court—in other words, the sort of practice on which&para;<br>the majority relies in this case—does not relieve us of our&para;<br>duty to interpret the Constitution in light of its text, struc­&para;<br>ture, and original understanding.&para;<br>Ignoring our more recent precedent in this area, which&para;<br>is extensive, the majority relies on The Pocket Veto Case,&para;<br>279 U. S. 655, 689 (1929), for the proposition that when&para;<br>interpreting a constitutional provision “regulating the&para;<br>relationship between Congress and the President,” we&para;<br>must defer to the settled practice of the political branches&para;<br>if the provision is “ ‘ “in any respect of doubtful meaning.” ’ ”&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>Ante, at 7; see ante, at 8, 16, 23, 33. The language the&para;<br>majority quotes from that case was pure dictum. The&para;<br>Pocket Veto Court had to decide whether a bill passed by&para;<br>the House and Senate and presented to the President less&para;<br>than 10 days before the adjournment of the first session of&para;<br>a particular Congress, but neither signed nor vetoed by&para;<br>the President, became a law. Most of the opinion analyzed&para;<br>that issue like any other legal question and concluded that&para;<br>treating the bill as a law would have been inconsistent&para;<br>with the text and structure of the Constitution. Only near&para;<br>the end of the opinion did the Court add that its conclu­&para;<br>sion was “confirmed” by longstanding Presidential practice&para;<br>in which Congress appeared to have acquiesced. 279&para;<br>U. S., at 688–689. We did not suggest that the case would&para;<br>have come out differently had the longstanding practice&para;<br>been otherwise.1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The other cases cited by the majority in which we have afforded&para;<br>significant weight to historical practice, ante, at 8, are consistent with&para;<br>the principles described above. Nearly all involved venerable and&para;<br>unchallenged practices, and constitutional provisions that were either&para;<br>deeply ambiguous or plainly supportive of the practice. See Dames &amp;&para;<br>Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 679–681, and n. 8, 686 (1981) (citing&para;<br>Presidential practice dating from 1799 and never questioned by Con­&para;<br>gress to inform meaning of “Executive Power”); Ex parte Grossman, 267&para;<br>U.

Intra-Session Breaks&para;<br>The first question presented is whether “the Recess of&para;<br>the Senate,” during which the President’s recess­&para;<br>appointment power is active, is (a) the period between two&para;<br>of the Senate’s formal sessions, or (b) any break in the&para;<br>Senate’s proceedings. I would hold that “the Recess” is the&para;<br>gap between sessions and that the appointments at issue&para;<br>here are invalid because they undisputedly were made&para;<br>during the Senate’s session. The Court’s contrary conclu­&para;<br>sion—that “the Recess” includes “breaks in the midst of a&para;<br>session,” ante, at 9—is inconsistent with the Constitution’s&para;<br>text and structure, and it requires judicial fabrication of&para;<br>vague, unadministrable limits on the recess-appointment&para;<br>power (thus defined) that overstep the judicial role. And&para;<br>although the majority relies heavily on “historical prac­&para;<br>tice,” no practice worthy of our deference supports the&para;<br>majority’s conclusion on this issue.&para;<br>A. Plain Meaning&para;<br>A sensible interpretation of the Recess Appointments&para;<br>Clause should start by recognizing that the Clause uses&para;<br>the term “Recess” in contradistinction to the term “Ses­&para;<br>sion.” As Alexander Hamilton wrote: “The time within&para;<br>which the power is to operate ‘during the recess of the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>gress elected under the present constitution,” “recognized by many&para;<br>successive legislatures, and . . . acted upon by the judicial department,”&para;<br>in support of the conclusion that the Necessary and Proper Clause&para;<br>allowed Congress to incorporate a bank); Stuart v. Laird, 1 Cranch 299,&para;<br>309 (1803) (citing practice that “commence[d] with the organization of&para;<br>the judicial system” in rejecting challenge to Supreme Court Justices’&para;<br>riding circuit). Even Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361 (1989),&para;<br>which concluded that the constitutional text did not prohibit judges&para;<br>from undertaking extrajudicial duties and found “additional evidence”&para;<br>for that conclusion in a longstanding practice that it acknowledged had&para;<br>been “controversial,” emphasized that it was relying on “contemporane­&para;<br>ous practice by the Founders themselves” that had been “frequent and&para;<br>continuing” since ratification.

The life of each elected Congress typically&para;<br>consisted (as it still does) of two or more formal sessions&para;<br>separated by adjournments “sine die,” that is, without a&para;<br>specified return date. See GPO, Congressional Directory,&para;<br>113th Cong., pp. 524–542 (2013–2014) (hereinafter Con­&para;<br>gressional Directory) (listing sessions of Congress from&para;<br>1789 through 2013); 705 F. 3d 490, 512, and nn. 1–2&para;<br>(CADC 2013) (case below); ante, at 9. The period between&para;<br>two sessions was known as “the recess.” See 26 Annals of&para;<br>Cong. 748 (1814) (Sen. Gore) (“The time of the Senate&para;<br>consists of two periods, viz: their session and their re­&para;<br>cess”). As one scholar has thoroughly demonstrated, “in&para;<br>government practice the phrase ‘the Recess’ always re­&para;<br>ferred to the gap between sessions.” Natelson, The Ori­&para;<br>gins and Meaning of “Vacancies that May Happen During&para;<br>the Recess” in the Constitution’s Recess Appointments&para;<br>Clause, 37 Harv. J. L. &amp; Pub. Pol’y 199, 213 (2014) (here­&para;<br>inafter Natelson); see id., at 214–227 (providing dozens of&para;<br>examples). By contrast, other provisions of the Constitu­&para;<br>tion use the verb “adjourn” rather than “recess” to refer to&para;<br>the commencement of breaks during a formal legislative&para;<br>session. See, e.g., Art. I, §5, cl. 1; id., §5, cl. 4.2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The&para;<br>&para;<br>majority claims that “the phrase ‘the recess’ was used to refer to&para;<br>intra-session recesses at the time of the founding,” ante, at 10, but it&para;<br>offers strikingly little support for that assertion. It first cites a letter&para;<br>from George Washington that is quite obviously an example of impre­&para;<br>cise, colloquial usage. See 3 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787,&para;<br>p. 76 (M. Farrand rev. 1966) (“I had put my carriage in the hands of a&para;<br>workman to be repaired and had not the means of mooving [sic] during&para;<br>the recess”).

Webster, American Dictionary of the&para;<br>English Language (1828). So the Continental Congress&para;<br>could complain of the noise from passing carriages dis­&para;<br>rupting its “daily Session,” 29 Journals of the Continental&para;<br>Congress 1774–1789, p. 561 (1785) (J. Fitzpatrick ed.&para;<br>1933), and the House could “take a recess” from 4 o’clock&para;<br>to 6 o’clock, Journal of the House of Representatives, 17th&para;<br>Cong., 2d Sess., p. 259 (1823). But as even the majority&para;<br>acknowledges, the Constitution’s use of “the word ‘the’ in&para;<br>‘the [R]ecess’ ” tends to suggest “that the phrase refers to&para;<br>the single break separating formal sessions.” Ante, at 10.&para;<br>More importantly, neither the Solicitor General nor the&para;<br>majority argues that the Clause uses “session” in its loose,&para;<br>colloquial sense. And if “the next Session” denotes a for­&para;<br>mal session, then “the Recess” must mean the break be­&para;<br>tween formal sessions. As every commentator on the&para;<br>Clause until the 20th century seems to have understood,&para;<br>the “Recess” and the “Session” to which the Clause refers&para;<br>are mutually exclusive, alternating states. See, e.g., The&para;<br>Federalist No. 67, at 455 (explaining that appointments&para;<br>would require Senatorial consent “during the session of&para;<br>the Senate” and would be made by the President alone “in&para;<br>their recess”); 1 Op.

See&para;<br>Brief for Respondent Noel Canning 23; see also Natelson 207. Finally,&para;<br>the majority cites three pages from the Solicitor General’s brief without&para;<br>acknowledging the arguments offered in response to the Solicitor&para;<br>General’s few supposed counterexamples. See, e.g., Brief for Respond­&para;<br>ent Noel Canning 21–24; Natelson 222, n. 120.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v.

It is linguistically implausible to suppose—as the&para;<br>majority does—that the Clause uses one of those terms&para;<br>(“Recess”) informally and the other (“Session”) formally in&para;<br>a single sentence, with the result that an event can occur&para;<br>during both the “Recess” and the “Session.”&para;<br>Besides being linguistically unsound, the majority’s&para;<br>reading yields the strange result that an appointment&para;<br>made during a short break near the beginning of one&para;<br>official session will not terminate until the end of the&para;<br>following official session, enabling the appointment to last&para;<br>for up to two years. The majority justifies that result by&para;<br>observing that the process of confirming a nominee “may&para;<br>take several months.” Ante, at 17. But the average dura­&para;<br>tion of the confirmation process is irrelevant. The Clause’s&para;<br>self-evident design is to have the President’s unilateral&para;<br>appointment last only until the Senate has “had an oppor­&para;<br>tunity to act on the subject.” 3 J. Story, Commentaries on&para;<br>the Constitution of the United States §1551, p. 410 (1833)&para;<br>(emphasis added).&para;<br>One way to avoid the linguistic incongruity of the major­&para;<br>ity’s reading would be to read both “the Recess” and “the&para;<br>next Session” colloquially, so that the recess-appointment&para;<br>power would be activated during any temporary suspen­&para;<br>sion of Senate proceedings, but appointments made pur­&para;<br>suant to that power would last only until the beginning of&para;<br>the next suspension (which would end the next colloquial&para;<br>session). See, e.g., Rappaport, The Original Meaning of&para;<br>the Recess Appointments Clause, 52 UCLA L. Rev. 1487,&para;<br>1569 (2005) (hereinafter Rappaport, Original Meaning).&para;<br>That approach would be more linguistically defensible&para;<br>than the majority’s. But it would not cure the most fun­&para;<br>damental problem with giving “Recess” its colloquial,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>rather than its formal, meaning: Doing so leaves the re­&para;<br>cess-appointment power without a textually grounded&para;<br>principle limiting the time of its exercise.&para;<br>The dictionary definitions of “recess” on which the ma­&para;<br>jority relies provide no such principle. On the contrary,&para;<br>they make clear that in colloquial usage, a recess could&para;<br>include any suspension of legislative business, no&para;<br>matter how short. See 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the&para;<br>English Language 1602 (4th ed. 1773). Webster even&para;<br>provides a stark illustration: “[T]he house of representa­&para;<br>tives had a recess of half an hour.” 2 Webster, supra. The&para;<br>notion that the Constitution empowers the President to&para;<br>make unilateral appointments every time the Senate&para;<br>takes a half-hour lunch break is so absurd as to be self­&para;<br>refuting. But that, in the majority’s view, is what the text&para;<br>authorizes.&para;<br>The boundlessness of the colloquial reading of “the&para;<br>Recess” thus refutes the majority’s assertion that the&para;<br>Clause’s “purpose” of “ensur[ing] the continued function­&para;<br>ing of the Federal Government” demands that it apply to&para;<br>intra-session breaks as well as inter-session recesses.&para;<br>Ante, at 11. The majority disregards another self-evident&para;<br>purpose of the Clause: to preserve the Senate’s role in the&para;<br>appointment process—which the founding generation&para;<br>regarded as a critical protection against “ ‘despotism,’ ”&para;<br>Freytag, 501 U. S., at 883—by clearly delineating the&para;<br>times when the President can appoint officers without the&para;<br>Senate’s consent. Today’s decision seriously undercuts&para;<br>that purpose. In doing so, it demonstrates the folly of&para;<br>interpreting constitutional provisions designed to estab­&para;<br>lish “a structure of government that would protect liberty,”&para;<br>Bowsher, 478 U. S., at 722, on the narrow-minded as­&para;<br>sumption that their only purpose is to make the govern­&para;<br>ment run as efficiently as possible. “Convenience and&para;<br>efficiency,” we have repeatedly recognized, “are not the&para;<br>primary objectives” of our constitutional framework.

Ante, at 17. Even if I accepted the&para;<br>canard that courts can alter the Constitution’s meaning to&para;<br>accommodate changed circumstances, I would be hard&para;<br>pressed to see the relevance of that notion here. The rise&para;<br>of intra-session adjournments has occurred in tandem&para;<br>with the development of modern forms of communication&para;<br>and transportation that mean the Senate “is always avail­&para;<br>able” to consider nominations, even when its Members are&para;<br>temporarily dispersed for an intra-session break. Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 21 (GINSBURG, J.). The Recess Appointments&para;<br>Clause therefore is, or rather, should be, an anachro­&para;<br>nism—“essentially an historic relic, something whose&para;<br>original purpose has disappeared.” Id., at 19 (KAGAN, J.).&para;<br>The need it was designed to fill no longer exists, and its&para;<br>only remaining use is the ignoble one of enabling the&para;<br>President to circumvent the Senate’s role in the appoint­&para;<br>ment process. That does not justify “read[ing] it out of the&para;<br>Constitution” and, contra the majority, ante, at 40, I would&para;<br>not do so; but neither would I distort the Clause’s original&para;<br>meaning, as the majority does, to ensure a prominent role&para;<br>for the recess-appointment power in an era when its influ­&para;<br>ence is far more pernicious than beneficial.&para;<br>To avoid the absurd results that follow from its collo­&para;<br>quial reading of “the Recess,” the majority is forced to declare&para;<br>that some intra-session breaks—though undisputedly&para;<br>within the phrase’s colloquial meaning—are simply “too&para;<br>short to trigger the Recess Appointments Clause.” Ante,&para;<br>at 21. But it identifies no textual basis whatsoever for&para;<br>limiting the length of “the Recess,” nor does it point to any&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

It is&para;<br>inconceivable that the Framers would have left the cir­&para;<br>cumstances in which the President could exercise such a&para;<br>significant and potentially dangerous power so utterly&para;<br>indeterminate. Other structural provisions of the Consti­&para;<br>tution that turn on duration are quite specific: Neither&para;<br>House can adjourn “for more than three days” without the&para;<br>other’s consent. Art. I, §5, cl. 4. The President must&para;<br>return a passed bill to Congress “within ten Days (Sun­&para;<br>days excepted),” lest it become a law. Id., §7, cl. 2. Yet on&para;<br>the majority’s view, when the first Senate considered&para;<br>taking a 1-month break, a 3-day weekend, or a half-hour&para;<br>siesta, it had no way of knowing whether the President&para;<br>would be constitutionally authorized to appoint officers in&para;<br>its absence. And any officers appointed in those circum­&para;<br>stances would have served under a cloud, unable to de­&para;<br>termine with any degree of confidence whether their ap­&para;<br>pointments were valid.3&para;<br>Fumbling for some textually grounded standard, the&para;<br>majority seizes on the Adjournments Clause, which bars&para;<br>either House from adjourning for more than three days&para;<br>without the other’s consent. Id., §5, cl. 4. According to the&para;<br>majority, that clause establishes that a 3-day break is&para;<br>always “too short” to trigger the Recess Appointments&para;<br>Clause. Ante, at 19. It goes without saying that nothing&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The majority insists that “the most likely reason the Framers did&para;<br>not place a textual floor underneath the word ‘recess’ is that they did&para;<br>not foresee the need for one” because they did not anticipate that intra­&para;<br>session breaks “would become lengthier and more significant than&para;<br>inter-session ones.” Ante, at 19. The majority’s logic escapes me. The&para;<br>Framers’ supposed failure to anticipate “length[y]” intra-session breaks&para;<br>might explain why (as I maintain) they did not bother to authorize&para;<br>recess appointments during intra-session breaks at all; but it cannot&para;<br>explain why (as the majority holds) they would have enacted a text that&para;<br>authorizes appointments during all intra-session breaks—even the&para;<br>short ones the majority says they did anticipate—without placing a&para;<br>temporal limitation on that power.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>in the constitutional text supports that disposition. If (as&para;<br>the majority concludes) “the Recess” means a recess in the&para;<br>colloquial sense, then it necessarily includes breaks shorter&para;<br>than three days. And the fact that the Constitution in­&para;<br>cludes a 3-day limit in one clause but omits it from the&para;<br>other weighs strongly against finding such a limit to be&para;<br>implicit in the clause in which it does not appear. In all&para;<br>events, the dramatically different contexts in which the&para;<br>two clauses operate make importing the 3-day limit from&para;<br>the Adjournments Clause into the Recess Appointments&para;<br>Clause “both arbitrary and mistaken.” Rappaport, Origi­&para;<br>nal Meaning 1556.&para;<br>And what about breaks longer than three days? The&para;<br>majority says that a break of four to nine days is “pre­&para;<br>sumptively too short” but that the presumption may be&para;<br>rebutted in an “unusual circumstance,” such as a “national&para;<br>catastrophe . . . that renders the Senate unavailable but&para;<br>calls for an urgent response.” Ante, at 21. The majority&para;<br>must hope that the in terrorem effect of its “presumptively&para;<br>too short” pronouncement will deter future Presidents&para;<br>from making any recess appointments during 4-to-9-day&para;<br>breaks and thus save us from the absurd spectacle of&para;<br>unelected judges evaluating (after an evidentiary hear­&para;<br>ing?) whether an alleged “catastrophe” was sufficiently&para;<br>“urgent” to trigger the recess-appointment power. The&para;<br>majority also says that “political opposition in the Senate&para;<br>would not qualify as an unusual circumstance.” Ibid. So&para;<br>if the Senate should refuse to confirm a nominee whom the&para;<br>President considers highly qualified; or even if it should&para;<br>refuse to confirm any nominee for an office, thinking the&para;<br>office better left vacant for the time being; the President’s&para;<br>power would not be triggered during a 4-to-9-day break, no&para;<br>matter how “urgent” the President’s perceived need for the&para;<br>officer’s assistance. (The majority protests that this&para;<br>“should go without saying—except that JUSTICE SCALIA&para;<br>compels us to say it,” ibid., seemingly forgetting that the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Or can litigants seek&para;<br>invalidation of an appointment made during a 10-day&para;<br>break by pointing to an absence of “unusual” or “urgent”&para;<br>circumstances necessitating an immediate appointment,&para;<br>albeit without the aid of a “presumpt[ion]” in their favor?&para;<br>Or, to put the question as it will present itself to lawyers&para;<br>in the Executive Branch: Can the President make an&para;<br>appointment during a 10-day break simply to overcome&para;<br>“political opposition in the Senate” despite the absence of&para;<br>any “national catastrophe,” even though it “go[es] without&para;<br>saying” that he cannot do so during a 9-day break? Who&para;<br>knows? The majority does not say, and neither does the&para;<br>Constitution.4&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The&para;<br>&para;<br>majority erroneously suggests that the “lack of a textual floor&para;<br>raises a problem that plagues” both interpretations of “the Recess.”&para;<br>Ante, at 19. Not so. If the Clause is given its plain meaning, the&para;<br>President cannot make recess appointments during the session but can&para;<br>make recess appointments during any break between sessions, no&para;<br>matter how short. Contra the majority, that is not a “problem.” True,&para;<br>the recess-appointment power applies even during very short inter­&para;<br>session breaks. But inter-session breaks typically occur at most a few&para;<br>times a year, and the recess-appointment power is of limited utility&para;<br>during very short inter-session breaks since, as explained below, the&para;<br>President can fill only those vacancies that arise during the break. See&para;<br>Part III, infra. Of course, as the Senate Judiciary Committee has&para;<br>argued, the break must be actual and not “constructive”; the Senate&para;<br>must adjourn for some measurable period of time between the two&para;<br>sessions. See infra, at 20–22. But the requirement that there actually&para;<br>be a recess does not involve anywhere near the level of indeterminacy&para;<br>entailed by the majority’s requirement that the recess be long enough&para;<br>(or the circumstances unusual enough), as determined by a court, to&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v.

In fact, Congress took 11 intra-session breaks&para;<br>of more than three days during that time, see Congres­&para;<br>sional Directory 524–527, and it appears Presidents made&para;<br>recess appointments during none of them.&para;<br>More importantly, during those eight decades, Congress&para;<br>must have taken thousands of breaks that were three days&para;<br>or shorter.

Yet there is no record of anyone, ever, having&para;<br>so much as mentioned the possibility that the recess­&para;<br>appointment power was activated during those breaks.&para;<br>That would be surprising indeed if the text meant what&para;<br>the majority thinks it means.

See, e.g., Brief for Constitutional Law Scholars as&para;<br>Amici Curiae 23–24; Rappaport, Nonoriginalism 27–33. It&para;<br>seems likely that at least 36 of the 57 appointments were&para;<br>made with the understanding that they took place during&para;<br>a recess between sessions. See id., at 27–31.&para;<br>As for the remainder, the historical record reveals noth­&para;<br>ing about how they were justified, if at all. There is no&para;<br>indication that Johnson’s Attorney General or anyone else&para;<br>considered at the time whether those appointments were&para;<br>made between or during formal legislative sessions or, if&para;<br>the latter, how they could be squared with the constitu­&para;<br>tional text. The majority drives that point home by citing&para;<br>a judicial opinion that upheld one of the appointments&para;<br>nearly two decades later with no analysis of the question&para;<br>presented here. See ante, at 11 (citing Gould v. United&para;<br>States, 19 Ct. Cl. 593 (1884)). Johnson’s intra-session&para;<br>appointments were disavowed by the first Attorney Gen­&para;<br>eral to address that question, see infra, at 20, and were&para;<br>not followed as precedent by the Executive Branch for&para;<br>more than 50 years, see infra, at 22.

He explained:&para;<br>“[T]he Constitution and laws make it clear that in our&para;<br>legislative practice an adjournment during a session&para;<br>of Congress means a merely temporary suspension of&para;<br>business from day to day . . . whereas the recess means&para;<br>the period after the final adjournment of Congress for&para;<br>the session, and before the next session begins. . . . It&para;<br>is this period following the final adjournment for the&para;<br>session which is the recess during which the President&para;<br>has power to fill vacancies . . . . Any intermediate&para;<br>temporary adjournment is not such recess, although it&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>may be a recess in the general and ordinary use of&para;<br>that term.” Id., at 601.6&para;<br>Knox went on to observe that none of the “many elaborate&para;<br>opinions” of previous Attorneys General concerning the&para;<br>recess-appointment power had asserted that the power&para;<br>could be exercised “during a temporary adjournment of the&para;<br>Senate,” rather than “during the recess of the Senate&para;<br>between two sessions of Congress.” Id., at 602. He&para;<br>acknowledged the contrary example furnished by John­&para;<br>son’s appointments in 1867 and 1868, but noted (with&para;<br>perhaps too much tact) that “[t]he public circumstances&para;<br>producing this state of affairs were unusual and involved&para;<br>results which should not be viewed as precedents.” Id.,&para;<br>at 603.&para;<br>That was where things stood when, in 1903, Roosevelt&para;<br>made a number of controversial recess appointments. At&para;<br>noon on December 7, the Senate moved seamlessly from a&para;<br>special session into a regular one scheduled to begin at&para;<br>that hour. See 37 Cong. Rec. 544; 38 Cong. Rec. 1. Roose­&para;<br>velt claimed to have made the appointments in a “con­&para;<br>structive” recess between the two sessions. See Special&para;<br>Session Is Merged Into Regular, N. Y. Times, Dec. 8, 1903,&para;<br>p. 1. He and his allies in the Senate justified the ap­&para;<br>pointments on the theory that “at the moment the gavel&para;<br>falls to summon the regular session into being there is an&para;<br>infinitesimal fraction of a second, which is the recess&para;<br>between the two sessions.” Extra Session Muddle, N.

The report explained that the recess is “the&para;<br>period of time when the Senate is not sitting in regular or&para;<br>extraordinary session . . . when its members owe no duty&para;<br>of attendance; when its Chamber is empty; when, because&para;<br>of its absence, it can not receive communications from the&para;<br>President or participate as a body in making appoint­&para;<br>ments.” Id., at 2 (emphasis deleted).&para;<br>The majority seeks support in this episode, claiming&para;<br>that the Judiciary Committee embraced a “broad and&para;<br>functional definition of ‘recess’ ” consistent with the one&para;<br>the majority adopts. Ante, at 16. On the contrary, the&para;<br>episode powerfully refutes the majority’s theory. Roosevelt’s&para;<br>legal justification for his appointments was extremely&para;<br>aggressive, but even he recognized that “the Recess of&para;<br>the Senate” could take place only between formal sessions.&para;<br>If the majority’s view of the Clause had been considered&para;<br>plausible, Roosevelt could have strengthened his position&para;<br>considerably by making the appointments during an intra­&para;<br>session break of a few days, or at least a few hours. (Just&para;<br>10 minutes after the new session began on December 7,&para;<br>the Senate took “a recess for one hour.” 38 Cong.

It rests&para;<br>that contention entirely on the 1905 Judiciary Committee&para;<br>Report. This distorts what the committee said when it&para;<br>denied Roosevelt’s claim that there had been a recess. If&para;<br>someone avers that a catfish is a cat, and I respond by&para;<br>pointing out that a catfish lives in water and does not have&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v.

Likewise, when the&para;<br>Judiciary Committee explained that an instantaneous&para;<br>transition from one session to another is not a recess&para;<br>because the Senate is never absent, it did not suggest that&para;<br>the Senate’s absence is enough to create a recess. To&para;<br>assume otherwise, as the majority does, is to commit the&para;<br>fallacy of the inverse (otherwise known as denying the&para;<br>antecedent): the incorrect assumption that if P implies Q,&para;<br>then not-P implies not-Q. Contrary to that fallacious&para;<br>assumption, the Judiciary Committee surely believed,&para;<br>consistent with the Executive’s clear position at the time,&para;<br>that “the Recess” was limited to (actual, not constructive)&para;<br>breaks between sessions.&para;<br>4. 1921 to the Present&para;<br>It is necessary to skip over the first 13 decades of our&para;<br>Nation’s history in order to find a Presidential legal ad­&para;<br>viser arguably embracing the majority’s interpretation of&para;<br>“the Recess.” In 1921 President Harding’s Attorney General,&para;<br>Harry Daugherty, advised Harding that he could make&para;<br>recess appointments while the Senate stood adjourned for&para;<br>28 days during the session because “the term ‘recess’ must&para;<br>be given a practical construction.” 33 Op.

Daugherty acknowledged Knox’s 1901 opinion to the&para;<br>contrary, id., at 21, but he (committing the same fallacy as&para;<br>today’s majority) thought the 1905 Judiciary Committee&para;<br>report had come to the opposite conclusion, id., at 23–24.&para;<br>He also recognized the fundamental flaw in this interpre­&para;<br>tation: that it would be impossible to “accurately dra[w]” a&para;<br>line between intra-session breaks that constitute “the&para;<br>Recess” and those that do not. Id., at 25. But he thought&para;<br>the absence of a standard gave the President “discretion to&para;<br>determine when there is a real and genuine recess.” Ibid.&para;<br>While a “palpable abuse of discretion might subject his&para;<br>appointment to review,” Daugherty thought that “[e]very&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

The Solicitor General has&para;<br>identified 22 such appointments made by Presidents&para;<br>Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, and Franklin Roosevelt be­&para;<br>tween 1921 and 1944. App. to Brief for Petitioner 9a–12a.&para;<br>Intra-session recess appointments experienced a brief&para;<br>heyday after World War II, with President Truman mak­&para;<br>ing about 150 such appointments to civilian positions and&para;<br>several thousand to military posts from 1945 through&para;<br>1950. Id., at 12a–27a. (The majority’s impressive­&para;<br>sounding claim that “Presidents have made thousands of&para;<br>intra-session recess appointments,” ante, at 12, depends&para;<br>entirely on post-war military appointments that Truman&para;<br>made in just two years, 1947 and 1948.) President Eisen­&para;<br>hower made only 43 intra-session recess appointments,&para;<br>id., at 27a–30a, after which the practice sank back into&para;<br>relative obscurity. Presidents Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson,&para;<br>and Ford made none, while Nixon made just 7. Id., at&para;<br>30a–31a. The practice rose again in the last decades of&para;<br>the 20th century: President Carter made 17 intra-session&para;<br>recess appointments, Reagan 72, George H. W.

See supra, at 10; Rappaport, Non­&para;<br>originalism 34–35.&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>Legal advisers in the Executive Branch during this&para;<br>period typically endorsed the President’s authority to&para;<br>make intra-session recess appointments by citing Daugh­&para;<br>erty’s opinion with little or no additional analysis. See,&para;<br>e.g., 20 Opinions of Office of Legal Counsel (Op. OLC) 124,&para;<br>161 (1996) (finding the question to have been “settled&para;<br>within the executive branch” by Daugherty’s “often-cited&para;<br>opinion”). The majority’s contention that “opinions of&para;<br>Presidential legal advisers . . . are nearly unanimous in&para;<br>determining that the Clause authorizes [intra-session&para;<br>recess] appointments,” ante, at 12, is thus true but mis­&para;<br>leading: No Presidential legal adviser approved that prac­&para;<br>tice before 1921, and subsequent approvals have rested&para;<br>more on precedent than on independent examination.&para;<br>The majority is correct that during this period, the&para;<br>Senate “as a body” did not formally repudiate the emerg­&para;<br>ing executive practice. Ante, at 14. And on one occasion,&para;<br>Comptroller General Lindsay Warren cited Daugherty’s&para;<br>opinion as representing “the accepted view” on the ques­&para;<br>tion, 28 Comp. Gen. 30, 34 (1948), although there is no&para;<br>evidence he consulted any Senators or that his statement&para;<br>reflected their views. But the rise of intra-session recess&para;<br>appointments in the latter half of the 20th century drew&para;<br>sharp criticism from a number of Senators on both sides of&para;<br>the aisle. At first, their objections focused on the length of&para;<br>the intra-session breaks at issue. See, e.g., 130 Cong. Rec.&para;<br>22774–22776 (1984) (Sen. Sarbanes) (decrying recess&para;<br>appointment during a 3-week intra-session adjournment&para;<br>as “a circumvention of the Senate confirmation power”);&para;<br>id., at 23235 (resolution offered by Sen. Byrd, with 39&para;<br>cosponsors, urging that no recess appointments occur&para;<br>during intra-session breaks of fewer than 30 days).&para;<br>Later, many Senators sought to end intra-session recess&para;<br>appointments altogether. In 1993, the Senate Legal&para;<br>Counsel prepared a brief to be filed on behalf of the Senate&para;<br>in Mackie v. Clinton, 827 F. Supp. 56 (DC 1993), vacated&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Rec. 15266–15267. The brief argued that “the&para;<br>recess[-appointment] power is limited to Congress’ annual&para;<br>recess between sessions,” that no contrary executive prac­&para;<br>tice “of any appreciable magnitude” had existed before&para;<br>“the past fifty years,” and that the Senate had not “acqui­&para;<br>esced in this steady expansion of presidential power.” Id.,&para;<br>at 15268, 15270. It explained that some Senators had&para;<br>limited their objections to shorter intra-session breaks out&para;<br>of a desire “to coexist with the Executive” but that “the&para;<br>Executive’s subsequent, steady chipping away at the&para;<br>length of recess sufficient for making recess appointments&para;<br>ha[d] demonstrated the need to return to the Framers’&para;<br>original intent and limit the power to intersession ad­&para;<br>journments.” Id., at 15267, 15272. Senator Kennedy&para;<br>reiterated that position in a brief to this Court in 2004.&para;<br>Brief for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy as Amicus Curiae in&para;<br>Franklin v. United States, O. T. 2004, No. 04–5858, p. 5.&para;<br>Today the partisan tables are turned, and that position is&para;<br>urged on us by the Senate’s Republican Members. See&para;<br>Brief for Sen. McConnell et al. as Amici Curiae 26.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>What does all this amount to? In short: Intra-session&para;<br>recess appointments were virtually unheard of for the first&para;<br>130 years of the Republic, were deemed unconstitutional&para;<br>by the first Attorney General to address them, were not&para;<br>openly defended by the Executive until 1921, were not&para;<br>made in significant numbers until after World War II, and&para;<br>have been repeatedly criticized as unconstitutional by&para;<br>Senators of both parties. It is astonishing for the majority&para;<br>to assert that this history lends “strong support,” ante, at&para;<br>11, to its interpretation of the Recess Appointments&para;<br>Clause. And the majority’s contention that recent execu­&para;<br>tive practice in this area merits deference because the&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>Senate has not done more to oppose it is utterly divorced&para;<br>from our precedent. “The structural interests protected by&para;<br>the Appointments Clause are not those of any one branch&para;<br>of Government but of the entire Republic,” Freytag, 501&para;<br>U. S., at 880, and the Senate could not give away those&para;<br>protections even if it wanted to. See Chadha, 462 U. S., at&para;<br>957–958; Clinton, 524 U. S., at 451–452 (KENNEDY, J.,&para;<br>concurring).&para;<br>Moreover, the majority’s insistence that the Senate&para;<br>gainsay an executive practice “as a body” in order to pre­&para;<br>vent the Executive from acquiring power by adverse pos­&para;<br>session, ante, at 14, will systematically favor the expansion&para;<br>of executive power at the expense of Congress. In any con­&para;<br>troversy between the political branches over a separation­&para;<br>of-powers question, staking out a position and defending&para;<br>it over time is far easier for the Executive Branch than&para;<br>for the Legislative Branch. See generally Bradley and&para;<br>Morrison, Historical Gloss and the Separation of Powers,&para;<br>126 Harv. L. Rev. 411, 439–447 (2012). All Presidents&para;<br>have a high interest in expanding the powers of their&para;<br>office, since the more power the President can wield, the&para;<br>more effectively he can implement his political agenda;&para;<br>whereas individual Senators may have little interest in&para;<br>opposing Presidential encroachment on legislative prerog­&para;<br>atives, especially when the encroacher is a President who&para;<br>is the leader of their own party. (The majority would not&para;<br>be able to point to a lack of “formal action” by the Senate&para;<br>“as a body” challenging intra-session recess appointments,&para;<br>ante, at 15–16, had the appointing President’s party in the&para;<br>Senate not blocked such action on multiple occasions.)&para;<br>And when the President wants to assert a power and&para;<br>establish a precedent, he faces neither the collective-action&para;<br>problems nor the procedural inertia inherent in the legis­&para;<br>lative process. The majority’s methodology thus all but&para;<br>guarantees the continuing aggrandizement of the Execu­&para;<br>tive Branch.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>27&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>III. Pre-Recess Vacancies&para;<br>The second question presented is whether vacancies&para;<br>that “happen during the Recess of the Senate,” which the&para;<br>President is empowered to fill with recess appointments,&para;<br>are (a) vacancies that arise during the recess, or (b) all&para;<br>vacancies that exist during the recess, regardless of when&para;<br>they arose. I would hold that the recess-appointment&para;<br>power is limited to vacancies that arise during the recess&para;<br>in which they are filled, and I would hold that the ap­&para;<br>pointments at issue here—which undisputedly filled pre­&para;<br>recess vacancies—are invalid for that reason as well as for&para;<br>the reason that they were made during the session. The&para;<br>Court’s contrary conclusion is inconsistent with the Con­&para;<br>stitution’s text and structure, and it further undermines&para;<br>the balance the Framers struck between Presidential and&para;<br>Senatorial power. Historical practice also fails to support&para;<br>the majority’s conclusion on this issue.&para;<br>A. Plain Meaning&para;<br>As the majority concedes, “the most natural meaning of&para;<br>‘happens’ as applied to a ‘vacancy’ . . . is that the vacancy&para;<br>‘happens’ when it initially occurs.” Ante, at 22. The ma­&para;<br>jority adds that this meaning is most natural “to a modern&para;<br>ear,” ibid., but it fails to show that founding-era ears&para;<br>heard it differently. “Happen” meant then, as it does now,&para;<br>“[t]o fall out; to chance; to come to pass.” 1 Johnson, Dic­&para;<br>tionary of the English Language 913. Thus, a vacancy&para;<br>that happened during the Recess was most reasonably&para;<br>understood as one that arose during the recess. It was, of&para;<br>course, possible in certain contexts for the word “happen”&para;<br>to mean “happen to be” rather than “happen to occur,” as&para;<br>in the idiom “it so happens.” But that meaning is not at&para;<br>all natural when the subject is a vacancy, a state of affairs&para;<br>that comes into existence at a particular moment in time.8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Despite&para;<br>&para;<br>initially admitting that the text “does not naturally favor”&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>In any event, no reasonable reader would have under­&para;<br>stood the Recess Appointments Clause to use the word&para;<br>“happen” in the majority’s “happen to be” sense, and thus&para;<br>to empower the President to fill all vacancies that might&para;<br>exist during a recess, regardless of when they arose. For&para;<br>one thing, the Clause’s language would have been a sur­&para;<br>passingly odd way of giving the President that power. The&para;<br>Clause easily could have been written to convey that&para;<br>meaning clearly: It could have referred to “all Vacancies&para;<br>that may exist during the Recess,” or it could have omitted&para;<br>the qualifying phrase entirely and simply authorized the&para;<br>President to “fill up all Vacancies during the Recess.”&para;<br>Given those readily available alternative phrasings, the&para;<br>reasonable reader might have wondered, why would any&para;<br>intelligent drafter intending the majority’s reading have&para;<br>inserted the words “that may happen”—words that, as the&para;<br>majority admits, make the majority’s desired reading&para;<br>awkward and unnatural, and that must be effectively read&para;<br>out of the Clause to achieve that reading?&para;<br>For another thing, the majority’s reading not only&para;<br>strains the Clause’s language but distorts its constitutional&para;<br>role, which was meant to be subordinate.

On the majority’s reading, the President would&para;<br>have had no need ever to seek the Senate’s advice and&para;<br>consent for his appointments: Whenever there was a fair&para;<br>prospect of the Senate’s rejecting his preferred nominee,&para;<br>the President could have appointed that individual unilat­&para;<br>erally during the recess, allowed the appointment to ex­&para;<br>pire at the end of the next session, renewed the appoint­&para;<br>ment the following day, and so on ad infinitum.&para;<br>(Circumvention would have been especially easy if, as the&para;<br>majority also concludes, the President was authorized to&para;<br>make such appointments during any intra-session break of&para;<br>more than a few days.) It is unthinkable that such an&para;<br>obvious means for the Executive to expand its power&para;<br>would have been overlooked during the ratification&para;<br>debates.9&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The majority insists that “character and politics” will ordinarily&para;<br>prevent the President from circumventing the Senate, and that the&para;<br>Senate has “political resources” to respond to attempts at circumven­&para;<br>tion. Ante, at 25. Neither character nor politics prevented Theodore&para;<br>Roosevelt from proclaiming a fictitious recess lasting an “infinitesimal&para;<br>fraction of a second.” In any event, the Constitution does not entrust&para;<br>the Senate’s role in the appointments process to the vagaries of charac­&para;<br>ter and politics.

Randolph wrote: “[I]s it a vacancy which has&para;<br>happened during the recess of the Senate?

A statute passed by the First Congress author­&para;<br>ized the President to appoint customs inspectors “with the&para;<br>advice and consent of the Senate” and provided that “if the&para;<br>appointment . . . shall not be made during the present&para;<br>session of Congress, the President . . . is hereby empow­&para;<br>ered to make such appointments during the recess of the&para;<br>Senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the&para;<br>end of their next session.” Act of Mar. 3, 1791, §4, 1 Stat.&para;<br>200. That authorization would have been superfluous if&para;<br>the Recess Appointments Clause had been understood to&para;<br>apply to pre-existing vacancies.

Before the passage of the Seventeenth Amend­&para;<br>ment, the Constitution provided that “if Vacancies [in the&para;<br>Senate] happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the&para;<br>Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive&para;<br>thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next&para;<br>Meeting of the Legislature.” Art.

Ante, at 30. But the latter view (which the majority does not&para;<br>endorse) was inseparably linked with the former (which the majority&para;<br>rejects), as is made clear by the very source the majority cites. See&para;<br>Letter from Alexander Hamilton to James McHenry (May 3, 1799), in&para;<br>23 Papers of Alexander Hamilton 94 (H.

Rawle, A View of the&para;<br>Constitution of the United States of America 163 (2d ed. 1829) (reprint&para;<br>2009) (“It has been held by [the Senate], that if new offices are created&para;<br>by congress, the president cannot, after the adjournment of the senate,&para;<br>make appointments to fill them.

It is&para;<br>thus clear that the phrase “happen . . . during the Recess”&para;<br>in the Senate Vacancies Clause was understood to refer to&para;<br>vacancies that arose, not merely existed, during the recess&para;<br>in which the appointment was made. It is not apparent&para;<br>why the nearly identical language of the Recess Appoint­&para;<br>ments Clause would have been understood differently.&para;<br>The majority, however, relies heavily on a contrary&para;<br>account of the Clause given by Attorney General William&para;<br>Wirt in 1823. See 1 Op. Atty. Gen 631. Wirt notably&para;<br>began—as does the majority—by acknowledging that his&para;<br>predecessors’ reading was “most accordant with the letter&para;<br>of the constitution.” Id., at 632. But he thought the “most&para;<br>natural” reading had to be rejected because it would inter­&para;<br>fere with the “substantial purpose of the constitution,”&para;<br>namely, “keep[ing] . . . offices filled.” Id., at 631–632. He&para;<br>was chiefly concerned that giving the Clause its plain&para;<br>meaning would produce “embarrassing inconveniences” if&para;<br>a distant office were to become vacant during the Senate’s&para;<br>session, but news of the vacancy were not to reach the&para;<br>President until the recess. Id., at 632, 634. The majority&para;<br>fully embraces Wirt’s reasoning. Ante, at 22–25.&para;<br>Wirt’s argument is doubly flawed. To begin, the Consti­&para;<br>tution provides ample means, short of rewriting its text,&para;<br>for dealing with the hypothetical dilemma Wirt posed.&para;<br>Congress can authorize “acting” officers to perform the&para;<br>duties associated with a temporarily vacant office—and&para;<br>has done that, in one form or another, since 1792. See 5&para;<br>U. S. C. §3345; Act of May 8, 1792, ch. 37, §8, 1 Stat. 281;&para;<br>705 F. 3d, at 511; Rappaport, Original Meaning 1514–&para;<br>1517. And on “extraordinary Occasions” the President can&para;<br>call the Senate back into session to consider a nomination.&para;<br>Art. II, §3. If the Framers had thought those options&para;<br>insufficient and preferred to authorize the President to&para;<br>make recess appointments to fill vacancies arising late in&para;<br>the session, they would have known how to do so. Massa­&para;<br>&para;<br>34&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>chusetts, for example, had authorized its Governor to&para;<br>make certain recess appointments “in case a vacancy shall&para;<br>happen . . . in the recess of the General Court [i.e., the&para;<br>state legislature], or at so late a period in any session of&para;<br>the same Court, that the vacancy . . . shall not be supplied&para;<br>in the same session thereof.” 1783 Mass. Acts ch. 12, in&para;<br>Acts and Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts&para;<br>523 (1890) (emphasis added).&para;<br>The majority protests that acting appointments, unlike&para;<br>recess appointments, are an “inadequate” solution to&para;<br>Wirt’s hypothetical dilemma because acting officers “may&para;<br>have less authority than Presidential appointments.”&para;<br>Ante, at 24–25. It cites an OLC opinion which states that&para;<br>“an acting officer . . . is frequently considered merely a&para;<br>caretaker without a mandate to take far-reaching&para;<br>measures.” 6 Op. OLC 119, 121 (1982). But just a few&para;<br>lines later, the majority says that “the lack of Senate&para;<br>approval . . . may diminish the recess appointee’s ability,&para;<br>as a practical matter, to get a controversial job done.”&para;<br>Ante, at 25. The majority does not explain why an acting&para;<br>officer would have less authority “as a practical matter”&para;<br>than a recess appointee. The majority also objects that&para;<br>requiring the President to rely on acting officers would&para;<br>“lessen the President’s ability to staff the Executive&para;<br>Branch with people of his own choosing,” ante, at 24—a&para;<br>surprising charge, since that is the very purpose of the&para;<br>Constitution’s advice-and-consent requirement. As for&para;<br>special sessions, the majority thinks it a sufficient answer&para;<br>to say that they are “burdensome,” ibid., an observation&para;<br>that fails to distinguish them from many procedures re­&para;<br>quired by our structural Constitution.&para;<br>More fundamentally, Wirt and the majority are mistaken&para;<br>to say that the Constitution’s “ ‘substantial purpose’ ” is&para;<br>to “ ‘keep . . . offices filled.’ ” Ibid. (quoting 1 Op. Atty.&para;<br>Gen., at 632). The Constitution is not a road map for&para;<br>maximally efficient government, but a system of “carefully&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>35&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>crafted restraints” designed to “protect the people from the&para;<br>improvident exercise of power.” Chadha, 462 U. S., at&para;<br>957, 959. Wirt’s and the majority’s argumentum ab incon­&para;<br>venienti thus proves far too much. There are many cir­&para;<br>cumstances other than a vacancy that can produce similar&para;<br>inconveniences if they arise late in the session: For exam­&para;<br>ple, a natural disaster might occur to which the Executive&para;<br>cannot respond effectively without a supplemental appro­&para;<br>priation. But in those circumstances, the Constitution&para;<br>would not permit the President to appropriate funds him­&para;<br>self. See Art. I, §9, cl. 7. Congress must either anticipate&para;<br>such eventualities or be prepared to be haled back into&para;<br>session. The troublesome need to do so is not a bug to be&para;<br>fixed by this Court, but a calculated feature of the consti­&para;<br>tutional framework. As we have recognized, while the&para;<br>Constitution’s government-structuring provisions can&para;<br>seem “clumsy” and “inefficient,” they reflect “hard choices&para;<br>. . . consciously made by men who had lived under a form&para;<br>of government that permitted arbitrary governmental acts&para;<br>to go unchecked.” Chadha, supra, at 959.&para;<br>B. Historical Practice&para;<br>For the reasons just given, it is clear that the Constitu­&para;<br>tion authorizes the President to fill unilaterally only those&para;<br>vacancies that arise during a recess, not every vacancy&para;<br>that happens to exist during a recess. Again, however, the&para;<br>majority says “[h]istorical practice” requires the broader&para;<br>interpretation. Ante, at 26. And again the majority&para;<br>is mistaken. Even if the Constitution were wrongly&para;<br>thought to be ambiguous on this point, a fair recounting&para;<br>of the relevant history does not support the majority’s&para;<br>interpretation.&para;<br>1. 1789 to 1822&para;<br>The majority correctly admits that there is “no undis­&para;<br>puted record of Presidents George Washington, John&para;<br>&para;<br>36&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>Adams, or Thomas Jefferson” using a recess appointment&para;<br>to fill a pre-recess vacancy. Ibid. That is not surprising in&para;<br>light of Randolph’s early conclusion that doing so would be&para;<br>unconstitutional. Adams on one occasion contemplated&para;<br>filling pre-recess vacancies but was dissuaded by, among&para;<br>others, Attorney General Lee, who said the Constitution&para;<br>did not permit him to do so. See 1799 McHenry Letter.12&para;<br>And the Solicitor General does not allege that even a&para;<br>single appointment made by Adams filled a pre-recess&para;<br>vacancy. Jefferson, too, at one point thought the Clause&para;<br>“susceptible of ” the majority’s reading, 1802 Jefferson&para;<br>Letter, but his administration, like Adams’, appears never&para;<br>to have adopted that reading.&para;<br>James Madison’s administration seems to have rejected&para;<br>the majority’s reading as well. In 1814, Madison wanted&para;<br>to appoint Andrew Jackson to a vacant major-generalship&para;<br>in the Army during the Senate’s recess, but he accepted,&para;<br>without contradiction or reservation, his Secretary of&para;<br>War’s advice that he lacked the power to do so because the&para;<br>post’s previous occupant had resigned before the recess.&para;<br>He therefore ordered that Jackson be given a “brevet of&para;<br>Major General,” i.e., a warrant conferring the nominal&para;<br>rank without the salary thereof.

NOEL CANNING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>4. 1940 to the Present&para;<br>The majority finds it highly significant that in 1940,&para;<br>Congress created a few carefully limited exceptions to the&para;<br>Pay Act’s prohibition on paying recess appointees who&para;<br>filled pre-recess vacancies. See Act of July 11, 1940, ch.&para;<br>580, 54 Stat. 751, now codified with nonsubstantive&para;<br>amendments at 5 U. S. C. §5503. Under the current ver­&para;<br>sion of the Act, “[p]ayment for services may not be made&para;<br>from the Treasury of the United States to an individual&para;<br>appointed during a recess of the Senate to fill a vacancy”&para;<br>that “existed while the Senate was in session” unless&para;<br>either the vacancy arose, or a different individual’s nomi­&para;<br>nation to fill the vacancy was rejected, “within 30 days&para;<br>before the end of the session”; or a nomination was pend­&para;<br>ing before the Senate at the end of the session, and the&para;<br>individual nominated was not himself a recess appointee.&para;<br>§5503(a)(1)–(3). And if the President fills a pre-recess&para;<br>vacancy under one of the circumstances specified in the&para;<br>Act, the law requires that he submit a nomination for that&para;<br>office to the Senate “not later than 40 days after the be­&para;<br>ginning of the next session.” §5503(b).&para;<br>The majority says that by allowing salaries to be paid to&para;<br>recess appointees in these narrow circumstances, “the&para;<br>1940 Senate (and later Senates) in effect supported” the&para;<br>majority’s interpretation of the Clause. Ante, at 32. Non­&para;<br>sense. Even as amended, the Act strictly regulates pay­&para;<br>ment to recess appointees who fill pre-recess vacancies,&para;<br>and it still forbids payment to many officers whose ap­&para;<br>pointments are constitutional under the majority’s inter­&para;<br>pretation.

There is a colorable argu­&para;<br>ment—which is routinely made by lawyers in the Execu­&para;<br>tive Branch—that Congress “ ‘cannot use the appropria­&para;<br>tions power to control a Presidential power that is beyond&para;<br>its direct control.’ ” 33 Op.

The Execu­&para;<br>tive has not challenged the Act’s constitutionality in this&para;<br>case, and I express no opinion on whether such a challenge&para;<br>would succeed. I simply point out that it is impossible to&para;<br>regard the amended Pay Act as evidence of Senatorial&para;<br>acquiescence in the majority’s reading when that reading&para;<br>has the potential to invalidate the Act.&para;<br>Since the Pay Act was amended, individual Senators&para;<br>&para;<br>46&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>have continued to maintain that recess appointments may&para;<br>not constitutionally be used to fill pre-recess vacancies.&para;<br>See, e.g., 130 Cong. Rec. 22780 (statement of seven Sena­&para;<br>tors that a recess appointment to the Federal Reserve&para;<br>Board in 1984 was unconstitutional because the vacancy&para;<br>“did not happen during the recess”); Brief for Sen.&para;<br>McConnell et al. as Amici Curiae 26 (45 Senators taking&para;<br>that view of the Clause). And there is no evidence that the&para;<br>watering-down of the Pay Act produced an immediate&para;<br>flood of recess appointments filling pre-recess vacancies.&para;<br>The Solicitor General has pointed us to only 40 such ap­&para;<br>pointments between 1940 and the present. App. to Brief&para;<br>for Petitioner 79a–89a.&para;<br>The majority, however, finds it significant that in two&para;<br>small “random sample[s]” of contemporary recess ap­&para;<br>pointments—24 since 1981 and 21 since 2000—the bulk of&para;<br>the appointments appear to have filled pre-existing vacan­&para;<br>cies. Ante, at 29. Based on that evidence, the majority&para;<br>thinks it “a fair inference that a large proportion of the&para;<br>recess appointments in the history of the Nation have&para;<br>filled pre-existing vacancies.” Ibid. The extrapolation of&para;<br>that sweeping conclusion from a small set of recent data&para;<br>does not bear even the slightest scrutiny. The majority&para;<br>ignores two salient facts: First, from the founding until the&para;<br>mid-19th century, the President’s authority to make such&para;<br>appointments was far from settled even within the Execu­&para;<br>tive Branch. Second, from 1863 until 1940, it was illegal&para;<br>to pay any recess appointee who filled a pre-recess va­&para;<br>cancy, which surely discouraged Presidents from making,&para;<br>and nominees from accepting, such appointments. Conse­&para;<br>quently, there is no reason to assume that the majority’s&para;<br>sampling—even if it accurately reflects practices during&para;<br>the last three decades—is at all typical of practices that&para;<br>prevailed throughout “the history of the Nation.”17&para;<br>——————&para;<br>17 The&para;<br>&para;<br>majority also notes that many of the intra-session recess ap­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>47&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>In sum: Washington’s and Adams’ Attorneys General&para;<br>read the Constitution to restrict recess appointments to&para;<br>vacancies arising during the recess, and there is no evi­&para;<br>dence that any of the first four Presidents consciously&para;<br>departed from that reading. The contrary reading was&para;<br>first defended by an executive official in 1823, was vehe­&para;<br>mently rejected by the Senate in 1863, was vigorously&para;<br>resisted by legislation in place from 1863 until 1940, and&para;<br>is arguably inconsistent with legislation in place from&para;<br>1940 to the present. The Solicitor General has identified&para;<br>only about 100 appointments that have ever been made&para;<br>under the broader reading, and while it seems likely that&para;<br>a good deal more have been made in the last few decades,&para;<br>there is good reason to doubt that many were made before&para;<br>1940 (since the appointees could not have been compen­&para;<br>sated). I can conceive of no sane constitutional theory&para;<br>under which this evidence of “historical practice”—which&para;<br>is actually evidence of a long-simmering inter-branch&para;<br>conflict—would require us to defer to the views of the&para;<br>Executive Branch.&para;<br>IV. Conclusion&para;<br>What the majority needs to sustain its judgment is an&para;<br>ambiguous text and a clear historical practice. What it&para;<br>——————&para;<br>pointments identified by the Solicitor General were made “within two&para;<br>weeks of the beginning of the recess,” which, according to the majority,&para;<br>“strongly suggests that many of the vacancies initially arose prior to&para;<br>the recess.” Ante, at 29. The inference is unwarranted, since there are&para;<br>many circumstances other than random chance that could cause a&para;<br>vacancy to arise early in the recess: For example, the prior officeholder&para;<br>may have been another recess appointee whose commission expired at&para;<br>the end of the Senate’s session, or he may have waited until the recess&para;<br>to resign so that his successor could be compensated without violating&para;<br>the Pay Act. In any event, the overwhelming majority of the intra­&para;<br>session recess appointments on the Solicitor General’s list occurred&para;<br>after 1945 and do not shed light on earlier practices.&para;<br>&para;<br>48&para;<br>&para;<br>NLRB v. NOEL CANNING&para;<br>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>has is a clear text and an at-best-ambiguous historical&para;<br>practice. Even if the Executive could accumulate power&para;<br>through adverse possession by engaging in a consistent&para;<br>and unchallenged practice over a long period of time, the&para;<br>oft-disputed practices at issue here would not meet that&para;<br>standard. Nor have those practices created any justifiable&para;<br>expectations that could be disappointed by enforcing the&para;<br>Constitution’s original meaning. There is thus no ground&para;<br>for the majority’s deference to the unconstitutional recess­&para;<br>appointment practices of the Executive Branch.&para;<br>The majority replaces the Constitution’s text with a new&para;<br>set of judge-made rules to govern recess appointments.&para;<br>Henceforth, the Senate can avoid triggering the Presi­&para;<br>dent’s now-vast recess-appointment power by the odd&para;<br>contrivance of never adjourning for more than three days&para;<br>without holding a pro forma session at which it is under­&para;<br>stood that no business will be conducted. Ante, at 33–34.&para;<br>How this new regime will work in practice remains to be&para;<br>seen. Perhaps it will reduce the prevalence of recess&para;<br>appointments. But perhaps not: Members of the Presi­&para;<br>dent’s party in Congress may be able to prevent the Sen­&para;<br>ate from holding pro forma sessions with the necessary&para;<br>frequency, and if the House and Senate disagree, the&para;<br>President may be able to adjourn both “to such Time as he&para;<br>shall think proper.” U. S. Const., Art. II, §3. In any event,&para;<br>the limitation upon the President’s appointment power is&para;<br>there not for the benefit of the Senate, but for the protec­&para;<br>tion of the people; it should not be dependent on Senate&para;<br>action for its existence.&para;<br>The real tragedy of today’s decision is not simply the&para;<br>abolition of the Constitution’s limits on the recess­&para;<br>appointment power and the substitution of a novel frame­&para;<br>work invented by this Court. It is the damage done to our&para;<br>separation-of-powers jurisprudence more generally. It is&para;<br>not every day that we encounter a proper case or contro­&para;<br>versy requiring interpretation of the Constitution’s struc­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.
