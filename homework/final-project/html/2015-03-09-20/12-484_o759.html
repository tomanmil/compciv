NASSAR&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–484.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued April 24, 2013—Decided June 24, 2013&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner, a university medical center (University) that is part of the&para;<br>University of Texas system, specializes in medical education. It has&para;<br>an affiliation agreement with Parkland Memorial Hospital (Hospital), which requires the Hospital to offer vacant staff physician posts&para;<br>to University faculty members. Respondent, a physician of Middle&para;<br>Eastern descent who was both a University faculty member and a&para;<br>Hospital staff physician, claimed that Dr. Levine, one of his supervisors at the University, was biased against him on account of his religion and ethnic heritage. He complained to Dr. Fitz, Levine’s supervisor. But after he arranged to continue working at the Hospital&para;<br>without also being on the University’s faculty, he resigned his teaching post and sent a letter to Fitz and others, stating that he was leaving because of Levine’s harassment. Fitz, upset at Levine’s public&para;<br>humiliation and wanting public exoneration for her, objected to the&para;<br>Hospital’s job offer, which was then withdrawn. Respondent filed&para;<br>suit, alleging two discrete Title VII violations. First, he alleged that&para;<br>Levine’s racially and religiously motivated harassment had resulted&para;<br>in his constructive discharge from the University, in violation of 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §2000e–2(a), which prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee “because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, and national origin” (referred to here as status-based discrimination). Second, he claimed that Fitz’s efforts to prevent the&para;<br>Hospital from hiring him were in retaliation for complaining about&para;<br>Levine’s harassment, in violation of §2000e–3(a), which prohibits&para;<br>employer retaliation “because [an employee] has opposed . . . an unlawful employment practice . . . or . . . made a [Title VII] charge.”&para;<br>The jury found for respondent on both claims. The Fifth Circuit va-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL&para;<br>CENTER v. NASSAR&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>cated as to the constructive-discharge claim, but affirmed as to the&para;<br>retaliation finding on the theory that retaliation claims brought under §2000e–3(a)—like §2000e–2(a) status-based claims—require only&para;<br>a showing that retaliation was a motivating factor for the adverse&para;<br>employment action, not its but-for cause, see §2000e–2(m). And it&para;<br>found that the evidence supported a finding that Fitz was motivated,&para;<br>at least in part, to retaliate against respondent for his complaints&para;<br>about Levine.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation, not the lessened causation test&para;<br>stated in §2000e–2(m). Pp. 5–23.&para;<br>(a) In defining the proper causation standard for Title VII retaliation claims, it is presumed that Congress incorporated tort law’s causation in fact standard—i.e., proof that the defendant’s conduct did in&para;<br>fact cause the plaintiff’s injury—absent an indication to the contrary&para;<br>in the statute itself. See Meyer v. Holley, 537 U. S. 280, 285. An employee alleging status-based discrimination under §2000e–2 need not&para;<br>show “but-for” causation. It suffices instead to show that the motive&para;<br>to discriminate was one of the employer’s motives, even if the employer also had other, lawful motives for the decision. This principle&para;<br>is the result of Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, and the&para;<br>ensuing Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act), which substituted a new&para;<br>burden-shifting framework for the one endorsed by Price Waterhouse.&para;<br>As relevant here, that Act added a new subsection to §2000e–2,&para;<br>providing that “an unlawful employment practice is established when&para;<br>the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or&para;<br>national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice,&para;<br>even though other factors also motivated the practice,” §2000e–2(m).&para;<br>Also relevant here is this Court’s decision in Gross v. FBL Finan­&para;<br>cial Services, Inc., 557 U. S. 167, 176, which interprets the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) phrase “because of&para;<br>. . . age,” 29 U. S. C. §623(a)(1). Gross holds two insights that inform&para;<br>the analysis of this case. The first is textual and concerns the proper&para;<br>interpretation of the term “because” as it relates to the principles of&para;<br>causation underlying both §623(a) and §2000e–3(a). The second is&para;<br>the significance of Congress’ structural choices in both Title VII itself&para;<br>and the 1991 Act. Pp. 5–11.&para;<br>(b) Title VII’s antiretaliation provision appears in a different section from its status-based discrimination ban. And, like §623(a)(1),&para;<br>the ADEA provision in Gross, §2000e–3(a) makes it unlawful for an&para;<br>employer to take adverse employment action against an employee&para;<br>“because” of certain criteria. Given the lack of any meaningful textual difference between §2000e–3(a) and §623(a)(1), the proper conclusion is that Title VII retaliation claims require proof that the desire&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>to retaliate was the but-for cause of the challenged employment action. Respondent and the United States maintain that §2000e–2(m)’s&para;<br>motivating-factor test applies, but that reading is flawed. First, it is&para;<br>inconsistent with the provision’s plain language, which addresses only race, color, religion, sex, and national origin discrimination and&para;<br>says nothing about retaliation. Second, their reading is inconsistent&para;<br>with the statute’s design and structure. Congress inserted the motivating-factor provision as a subsection within §2000e–2, which deals&para;<br>only with status-based discrimination. The conclusion that Congress&para;<br>acted deliberately in omitting retaliation claims from §2000–2(m) is&para;<br>reinforced by the fact that another part of the 1991 Act, §109, expressly refers to all unlawful employment actions. See EEOC v. Ara­&para;<br>bian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 256. Third, the cases they rely&para;<br>on, which state the general proposition that Congress’ enactment of a&para;<br>broadly phrased antidiscrimination statute may signal a concomitant&para;<br>intent to ban retaliation against individuals who oppose that discrimination, see, e.g., CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, 553 U. S. 442,&para;<br>452–453; Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, 553 U. S. 474, do not support the&para;<br>quite different rule that every reference to race, color, creed, sex, or&para;<br>nationality in an antidiscrimination statute is to be treated as a synonym for “retaliation,” especially in a precise, complex, and exhaustive statute like Title VII. The Americans with Disabilities Act of&para;<br>1990, which contains seven paragraphs of detailed description of the&para;<br>practices constituting prohibited discrimination, as well as an express antiretaliation provision, and which was passed only a year before §2000e–2(m)’s enactment, shows that when Congress elected to&para;<br>address retaliation as part of a detailed statutory scheme, it did so&para;<br>clearly. Pp. 11–17.&para;<br>(c) The proper interpretation and implementation of §2000e–3(a)&para;<br>and its causation standard are of central importance to the fair and&para;<br>responsible allocation of resources in the judicial and litigation systems, particularly since retaliation claims are being made with everincreasing frequency. Lessening the causation standard could also&para;<br>contribute to the filing of frivolous claims, siphoning resources from&para;<br>efforts by employers, agencies, and courts to combat workplace harassment. Pp. 18–20.&para;<br>(d) Respondent and the Government argue that their view would&para;<br>be consistent with longstanding agency views contained in an Equal&para;<br>Employment Opportunity Commission guidance manual, but the&para;<br>manual’s explanations for its views lack the persuasive force that is a&para;<br>necessary precondition to deference under Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,&para;<br>323 U. S. 134, 140. Respondent’s final argument—that if §2000e–&para;<br>2(m) does not control, then the Price Waterhouse standard should—is&para;<br>foreclosed by the 1991 Act’s amendments to Title VII, which dis-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

NAIEL NASSAR&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>[June 24, 2013]&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>When the law grants persons the right to compensation&para;<br>for injury from wrongful conduct, there must be some&para;<br>demonstrated connection, some link, between the injury&para;<br>sustained and the wrong alleged. The requisite relation&para;<br>between prohibited conduct and compensable injury is&para;<br>governed by the principles of causation, a subject most&para;<br>often arising in elaborating the law of torts. This case&para;<br>requires the Court to define those rules in the context of&para;<br>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. §2000e&para;<br>et seq., which provides remedies to employees for injuries&para;<br>related to discriminatory conduct and associated wrongs&para;<br>by employers.&para;<br>Title VII is central to the federal policy of prohibiting&para;<br>wrongful discrimination in the Nation’s workplaces and in&para;<br>all sectors of economic endeavor. This opinion discusses&para;<br>the causation rules for two categories of wrongful employer&para;<br>conduct prohibited by Title VII. The first type is called,&para;<br>for purposes of this opinion, status-based discrimination.&para;<br>The term is used here to refer to basic workplace protection such as prohibitions against employer discrimination&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL&para;<br>CENTER v. NASSAR&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,&para;<br>in hiring, firing, salary structure, promotion and the like.&para;<br>See §2000e–2(a). The second type of conduct is employer&para;<br>retaliation on account of an employee’s having opposed,&para;<br>complained of, or sought remedies for, unlawful workplace&para;<br>discrimination. See §2000e–3(a).&para;<br>An employee who alleges status-based discrimination&para;<br>under Title VII need not show that the causal link between injury and wrong is so close that the injury would&para;<br>not have occurred but for the act. So-called but-for causation is not the test. It suffices instead to show that the&para;<br>motive to discriminate was one of the employer’s motives,&para;<br>even if the employer also had other, lawful motives that&para;<br>were causative in the employer’s decision. This principle&para;<br>is the result of an earlier case from this Court, Price Water­&para;<br>house v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228 (1989), and an ensuing&para;<br>statutory amendment by Congress that codified in part&para;<br>and abrogated in part the holding in Price Waterhouse, see&para;<br>§§2000e–2(m), 2000e–5(g)(2)(B). The question the Court&para;<br>must answer here is whether that lessened causation&para;<br>standard is applicable to claims of unlawful employer&para;<br>retaliation under §2000e–3(a).&para;<br>Although the Court has not addressed the question of&para;<br>the causation showing required to establish liability for a&para;<br>Title VII retaliation claim, it has addressed the issue of&para;<br>causation in general in a case involving employer discrimination under a separate but related statute, the Age&para;<br>Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29&para;<br>U. S. C. §623. See Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc.,&para;<br>557 U. S. 167 (2009). In Gross, the Court concluded that&para;<br>the ADEA requires proof that the prohibited criterion was&para;<br>the but-for cause of the prohibited conduct. The holding&para;<br>and analysis of that decision are instructive here.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Petitioner, the University of Texas Southwestern Medi-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cal Center (University), is an academic institution within&para;<br>the University of Texas system. The University specializes&para;<br>in medical education for aspiring physicians, health&para;<br>professionals, and scientists. Over the years, the University has affiliated itself with a number of healthcare facilities including, as relevant in this case, Parkland Memorial&para;<br>Hospital (Hospital). As provided in its affiliation agreement with the University, the Hospital permits the University’s students to gain clinical experience working in its&para;<br>facilities. The agreement also requires the Hospital to&para;<br>offer empty staff physician posts to the University’s faculty&para;<br>members, see App. 361–362, 366, and, accordingly, most of&para;<br>the staff physician positions at the Hospital are filled by&para;<br>those faculty members.&para;<br>Respondent is a medical doctor of Middle Eastern descent who specializes in internal medicine and infectious&para;<br>diseases. In 1995, he was hired to work both as a member&para;<br>of the University’s faculty and a staff physician at the&para;<br>Hospital. He left both positions in 1998 for additional&para;<br>medical education and then returned in 2001 as an assistant professor at the University and, once again, as a&para;<br>physician at the Hospital.&para;<br>In 2004, Dr. Beth Levine was hired as the University’s&para;<br>Chief of Infectious Disease Medicine. In that position&para;<br>Levine became respondent’s ultimate (though not direct)&para;<br>superior. Respondent alleged that Levine was biased&para;<br>against him on account of his religion and ethnic heritage,&para;<br>a bias manifested by undeserved scrutiny of his billing&para;<br>practices and productivity, as well as comments that&para;<br>“ ‘Middle Easterners are lazy.’ ” 674 F. 3d 448, 450 (CA5&para;<br>2012). On different occasions during his employment,&para;<br>respondent met with Dr. Gregory Fitz, the University’s&para;<br>Chair of Internal Medicine and Levine’s supervisor, to&para;<br>complain about Levine’s alleged harassment. Despite&para;<br>obtaining a promotion with Levine’s assistance in 2006,&para;<br>respondent continued to believe that she was biased&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL&para;<br>CENTER v. NASSAR&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>against him. So he tried to arrange to continue working&para;<br>at the Hospital without also being on the University’s&para;<br>faculty. After preliminary negotiations with the Hospital&para;<br>suggested this might be possible, respondent resigned his&para;<br>teaching post in July 2006 and sent a letter to Dr. Fitz&para;<br>(among others), in which he stated that the reason for his&para;<br>departure was harassment by Levine. That harassment,&para;<br>he asserted, “ ‘stems from . . . religious, racial and cultural&para;<br>bias against Arabs and Muslims.’ ” Id., at 451. After&para;<br>reading that letter, Dr. Fitz expressed consternation at&para;<br>respondent’s accusations, saying that Levine had been&para;<br>“publicly humiliated by th[e] letter” and that it was “very&para;<br>important that she be publicly exonerated.” App. 41.&para;<br>Meanwhile, the Hospital had offered respondent a job as&para;<br>a staff physician, as it had indicated it would. On learning&para;<br>of that offer, Dr. Fitz protested to the Hospital, asserting&para;<br>that the offer was inconsistent with the affiliation agreement’s requirement that all staff physicians also be members&para;<br>of the University faculty. The Hospital then withdrew&para;<br>its offer.&para;<br>After exhausting his administrative remedies, respondent filed this Title VII suit in the United States District&para;<br>Court for the Northern District of Texas. He alleged two&para;<br>discrete violations of Title VII. The first was a statusbased discrimination claim under §2000e–2(a). Respondent&para;<br>alleged that Dr. Levine’s racially and religiously motivated harassment had resulted in his constructive discharge from the University. Respondent’s second claim&para;<br>was that Dr. Fitz’s efforts to prevent the Hospital from&para;<br>hiring him were in retaliation for complaining about Dr.&para;<br>Levine’s harassment, in violation of §2000e–3(a). 674&para;<br>F. 3d, at 452. The jury found for respondent on both&para;<br>claims. It awarded him over $400,000 in backpay and&para;<br>more than $3 million in compensatory damages. The&para;<br>District Court later reduced the compensatory damages&para;<br>award to $300,000.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

The court first concluded that respondent had submitted insufficient evidence in support of his constructive-discharge claim, so it&para;<br>vacated that portion of the jury’s verdict. The court affirmed as to the retaliation finding, however, on the theory&para;<br>that retaliation claims brought under §2000e–3(a)—like&para;<br>claims of status-based discrimination under §2000e–2(a)—&para;<br>require only a showing that retaliation was a motivating&para;<br>factor for the adverse employment action, rather than its&para;<br>but-for cause. See id., at 454, n. 16 (citing Smith v. Xerox&para;<br>Corp., 602 F. 3d 320, 330 (CA5 2010)). It further held that&para;<br>the evidence supported a finding that Dr. Fitz was motivated, at least in part, to retaliate against respondent for&para;<br>his complaints against Levine. The Court of Appeals then&para;<br>remanded for a redetermination of damages in light of its&para;<br>decision to vacate the constructive-discharge verdict.&para;<br>Four judges dissented from the court’s decision not to&para;<br>rehear the case en banc, arguing that the Circuit’s application of the motivating-factor standard to retaliation&para;<br>cases was “an erroneous interpretation of [Title VII] and&para;<br>controlling caselaw” and should be overruled en banc. 688&para;<br>F. 3d 211, 213–214 (CA5 2012) (Smith, J., dissenting from&para;<br>denial of rehearing en banc).&para;<br>Certiorari was granted. 568 U.

Causation&para;<br>in fact—i.e., proof that the defendant’s conduct did in fact&para;<br>cause the plaintiff ’s injury—is a standard requirement of&para;<br>any tort claim, see Restatement of Torts §9 (1934) (definition of “legal cause”); §431, Comment a (same); §279, and&para;<br>Comment c (intentional infliction of physical harm); §280&para;<br>(other intentional torts); §281(c) (negligence).

Dobbs, R.&para;<br>Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts&para;<br>265 (5th ed. 1984). This, then, is the background against&para;<br>which Congress legislated in enacting Title VII, and these&para;<br>are the default rules it is presumed to have incorporated,&para;<br>absent an indication to the contrary in the statute itself.&para;<br>See Meyer v. Holley, 537 U. S. 280, 285 (2003); Carey v.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 257–258 (1978).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Since the statute’s passage in 1964, it has prohibited&para;<br>employers from discriminating against their employees on&para;<br>any of seven specified criteria. Five of them—race, color,&para;<br>religion, sex, and national origin—are personal characteristics and are set forth in §2000e–2. (As noted at the&para;<br>outset, discrimination based on these five characteristics&para;<br>is called status-based discrimination in this opinion.) And&para;<br>then there is a point of great import for this case: The two&para;<br>remaining categories of wrongful employer conduct—the&para;<br>employee’s opposition to employment discrimination, and&para;<br>the employee’s submission of or support for a complaint&para;<br>that alleges employment discrimination—are not wrongs&para;<br>based on personal traits but rather types of protected&para;<br>employee conduct. These latter two categories are covered&para;<br>by a separate, subsequent section of Title VII, §2000e–&para;<br>3(a).&para;<br>Under the status-based discrimination provision, it is an&para;<br>“unlawful employment practice” for an employer “to discriminate against any individual . . . because of such&para;<br>individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”&para;<br>§2000e–2(a). In its 1989 decision in Price Waterhouse, the&para;<br>Court sought to explain the causation standard imposed&para;<br>by this language. It addressed in particular what it means&para;<br>for an action to be taken “because of ” an individual’s race,&para;<br>religion, or nationality. Although no opinion in that case&para;<br>commanded a majority, six Justices did agree that a plaintiff could prevail on a claim of status-based discrimination&para;<br>if he or she could show that one of the prohibited traits&para;<br>was a “motivating” or “substantial” factor in the employer’s decision. 490 U. S., at 258 (plurality opinion); id., at&para;<br>259 (White, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 276&para;<br>(O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment). If the plaintiff&para;<br>made that showing, the burden of persuasion would shift&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL&para;<br>CENTER v. NASSAR&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>to the employer, which could escape liability if it could&para;<br>prove that it would have taken the same employment&para;<br>action in the absence of all discriminatory animus. Id., at&para;<br>258 (plurality opinion); id., at 259–260 (opinion of White,&para;<br>J.); id., at 276–277 (opinion of O’Connor, J.). In other&para;<br>words, the employer had to show that a discriminatory&para;<br>motive was not the but-for cause of the adverse employment action.&para;<br>Two years later, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of&para;<br>1991 (1991 Act), 105 Stat. 1071. This statute (which had&para;<br>many other provisions) codified the burden-shifting and&para;<br>lessened-causation framework of Price Waterhouse in part&para;<br>but also rejected it to a substantial degree. The legislation&para;<br>first added a new subsection to the end of §2000e–2, i.e.,&para;<br>Title VII’s principal ban on status-based discrimination.&para;<br>See §107(a), 105 Stat. 1075. The new provision, §2000e–&para;<br>2(m), states:&para;<br>“[A]n unlawful employment practice is established&para;<br>when the complaining party demonstrates that race,&para;<br>color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating&para;<br>factor for any employment practice, even though other&para;<br>factors also motivated the practice.”&para;<br>This, of course, is a lessened causation standard.&para;<br>The 1991 Act also abrogated a portion of Price Water­&para;<br>house’s framework by removing the employer’s ability to&para;<br>defeat liability once a plaintiff proved the existence of an&para;<br>impermissible motivating factor. See Gross, 557 U. S., at&para;<br>178, n. 5. In its place, Congress enacted §2000e–5(g)(2),&para;<br>which provides:&para;<br>“(B) On a claim in which an individual proves a violation under section 2000e–2(m) of this title and [the&para;<br>employer] demonstrates that [it] would have taken&para;<br>the same action in the absence of the impermissible&para;<br>motivating factor, the court—&para;<br>“(i) may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief . . .&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and [limited] attorney’s fees and costs . . . ; and&para;<br>“(ii) shall not award damages or issue an order&para;<br>requiring any admission, reinstatement, hiring, promotion, or payment . . . .”&para;<br>So, in short, the 1991 Act substituted a new burdenshifting framework for the one endorsed by Price Water­&para;<br>house. Under that new regime, a plaintiff could obtain&para;<br>declaratory relief, attorney’s fees and costs, and some&para;<br>forms of injunctive relief based solely on proof that race,&para;<br>color, religion, sex, or nationality was a motivating factor&para;<br>in the employment action; but the employer’s proof that it&para;<br>would still have taken the same employment action would&para;<br>save it from monetary damages and a reinstatement&para;<br>order. See Gross, 557 U. S., at 178, n. 5; see also id., at&para;<br>175, n. 2, 177, n. 3.&para;<br>After Price Waterhouse and the 1991 Act, considerable&para;<br>time elapsed before the Court returned again to the meaning of “because” and the problem of causation. This time it&para;<br>arose in the context of a different, yet similar statute, the&para;<br>ADEA, 29 U. S. C. §623(a). See Gross, supra. Much like&para;<br>the Title VII statute in Price Waterhouse, the relevant&para;<br>portion of the ADEA provided that “ ‘[i]t shall be unlawful&para;<br>for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge&para;<br>any individual or otherwise discriminate against any&para;<br>individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s age.’ ” 557 U. S., at 176 (quoting §623(a)(1);&para;<br>emphasis and ellipsis in original).&para;<br>Concentrating first and foremost on the meaning of the&para;<br>phrase “ ‘because of . . . age,’ ” the Court in Gross explained&para;<br>that the ordinary meaning of “ ‘because of ’ ” is “ ‘by reason&para;<br>of ’ ” or “ ‘on account of.’ ” Id., at 176 (citing 1 Webster’s&para;<br>Third New International Dictionary 194 (1966); 1 Oxford&para;<br>English Dictionary 746 (1933); The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 132 (1966); emphasis in&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL&para;<br>CENTER v. NASSAR&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>original). Thus, the “requirement that an employer took&para;<br>adverse action ‘because of ’ age [meant] that age was the&para;<br>‘reason’ that the employer decided to act,” or, in other&para;<br>words, that “age was the ‘but-for’ cause of the employer’s&para;<br>adverse decision.” 557 U. S., at 176. See also Safeco Ins.&para;<br>Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 63–64, and n. 14&para;<br>(2007) (noting that “because of ” means “based on” and&para;<br>that “ ‘based on’ indicates a but-for causal relationship”);&para;<br>Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503&para;<br>U. S. 258, 265–266 (1992) (equating “by reason of ” with&para;<br>“ ‘but for’ cause”).&para;<br>In the course of approving this construction, Gross&para;<br>declined to adopt the interpretation endorsed by the plurality and concurring opinions in Price Waterhouse. Noting that “the ADEA must be ‘read . . . the way Congress&para;<br>wrote it,’ ” 557 U. S., at 179 (quoting Meacham v. Knolls&para;<br>Atomic Power Laboratory, 554 U. S. 84, 102 (2008)), the&para;<br>Court concluded that “the textual differences between&para;<br>Title VII and the ADEA” “prevent[ed] us from applying&para;<br>Price Waterhouse . . . to federal age discrimination claims,”&para;<br>557 U. S., at 175, n. 2. In particular, the Court stressed&para;<br>the congressional choice not to add a provision like&para;<br>§2000e–2(m) to the ADEA despite making numerous other&para;<br>changes to the latter statute in the 1991 Act. Id., at 174–&para;<br>175 (citing EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S.&para;<br>244, 256 (1991)); 557 U. S., at 177, n. 3 (citing 14 Penn&para;<br>Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 U. S. 247, 270 (2009)).&para;<br>Finally, the Court in Gross held that it would not be&para;<br>proper to read Price Waterhouse as announcing a rule that&para;<br>applied to both statutes, despite their similar wording and&para;<br>near-contemporaneous enactment. 557 U. S., at 178, n. 5.&para;<br>This different reading was necessary, the Court concluded,&para;<br>because Congress’ 1991 amendments to Title VII, including its “careful tailoring of the ‘motivating factor’ claim”&para;<br>and the substitution of §2000e–5(g)(2)(B) for Price Water­&para;<br>house’s full affirmative defense, indicated that the moti-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>vating-factor standard was not an organic part of Title VII&para;<br>and thus could not be read into the ADEA. See 557 U. S.,&para;<br>at 178, n. 5.&para;<br>In Gross, the Court was careful to restrict its analysis to&para;<br>the statute before it and withhold judgment on the proper&para;<br>resolution of a case, such as this, which arose under Title&para;<br>VII rather than the ADEA. But the particular confines of&para;<br>Gross do not deprive it of all persuasive force. Indeed,&para;<br>that opinion holds two insights for the present case. The&para;<br>first is textual and concerns the proper interpretation of&para;<br>the term “because” as it relates to the principles of causation underlying both §623(a) and §2000e–3(a). The second&para;<br>is the significance of Congress’ structural choices in both&para;<br>Title VII itself and the law’s 1991 amendments. These&para;<br>principles do not decide the present case but do inform its&para;<br>analysis, for the issues possess significant parallels.&para;<br>III&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>As noted, Title VII’s antiretaliation provision, which is&para;<br>set forth in §2000e–3(a), appears in a different section&para;<br>from Title VII’s ban on status-based discrimination. The&para;<br>antiretaliation provision states, in relevant part:&para;<br>“It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an&para;<br>employer to discriminate against any of his employees&para;<br>. . . because he has opposed any practice made an&para;<br>unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or&para;<br>because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or&para;<br>participated in any manner in an investigation,&para;<br>proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.”&para;<br>This enactment, like the statute at issue in Gross,&para;<br>makes it unlawful for an employer to take adverse employment action against an employee “because” of certain&para;<br>criteria. Cf. 29 U. S. C. §623(a)(1). Given the lack of any&para;<br>meaningful textual difference between the text in this&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL&para;<br>CENTER v. NASSAR&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>statute and the one in Gross, the proper conclusion here,&para;<br>as in Gross, is that Title VII retaliation claims require&para;<br>proof that the desire to retaliate was the but-for cause of&para;<br>the challenged employment action. See Gross, supra, at&para;<br>176.&para;<br>The principal counterargument offered by respondent&para;<br>and the United States relies on their different understanding of the motivating-factor section, which—on its face—&para;<br>applies only to status discrimination, discrimination on&para;<br>the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.&para;<br>In substance, they contend that: (1) retaliation is defined&para;<br>by the statute to be an unlawful employment practice; (2)&para;<br>§2000e–2(m) allows unlawful employment practices to be&para;<br>proved based on a showing that race, color, religion, sex, or&para;<br>national origin was a motivating factor for—and not necessarily the but-for factor in—the challenged employment&para;<br>action; and (3) the Court has, as a matter of course, held&para;<br>that “retaliation for complaining about race discrimination&para;<br>is ‘discrimination based on race.’ ” Brief for United States&para;<br>as Amicus Curiae 14; see id., at 11–14; Brief for Respondent 16–19.&para;<br>There are three main flaws in this reading of §2000e–&para;<br>2(m). The first is that it is inconsistent with the provision’s plain language. It must be acknowledged that&para;<br>because Title VII defines “unlawful employment practice”&para;<br>to include retaliation, the question presented by this case&para;<br>would be different if §2000e–2(m) extended its coverage to&para;<br>all unlawful employment practices. As actually written,&para;<br>however, the text of the motivating-factor provision, while&para;<br>it begins by referring to “unlawful employment practices,”&para;<br>then proceeds to address only five of the seven prohibited&para;<br>discriminatory actions—actions based on the employee’s&para;<br>status, i.e., race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.&para;<br>This indicates Congress’ intent to confine that provision’s&para;<br>coverage to only those types of employment practices. The&para;<br>text of §2000e–2(m) says nothing about retaliation claims.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Given this clear language, it would be improper to conclude that what Congress omitted from the statute is&para;<br>nevertheless within its scope. Gardner v. Collins, 2 Pet.&para;<br>58, 93 (1829) (“What the legislative intention was, can be&para;<br>derived only from the words they have used; and we cannot speculate beyond the reasonable import of these&para;<br>words”); see Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013)&para;<br>(slip op., at 8).&para;<br>The second problem with this reading is its inconsistency&para;<br>with the design and structure of the statute as a whole.&para;<br>See Gross, 557 U. S., at 175, n. 2, 178, n. 5. Just as Congress’ choice of words is presumed to be deliberate, so too&para;<br>are its structural choices. See id., at 177, n. 3. When&para;<br>Congress wrote the motivating-factor provision in 1991, it&para;<br>chose to insert it as a subsection within §2000e–2, which&para;<br>contains Title VII’s ban on status-based discrimination,&para;<br>§§2000e–2(a) to (d), (l), and says nothing about retaliation.&para;<br>See 1991 Act, §107(a), 105 Stat. 1075 (directing that&para;<br>“§2000e–2 . . .

The title of the&para;<br>section of the 1991 Act that created §2000e–2(m)—&para;<br>“Clarifying prohibition against impermissible consideration of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in&para;<br>employment practices”—also indicates that Congress&para;<br>determined to address only claims of status-based&para;<br>discrimination, not retaliation. See §107(a), id., at 1075.&para;<br>What is more, a different portion of the 1991 Act contains an express reference to all unlawful employment&para;<br>actions, thereby reinforcing the conclusion that Congress&para;<br>acted deliberately when it omitted retaliation claims from&para;<br>§2000e–2(m). See Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.

Or, it could&para;<br>have inserted the motivating-factor provision as part of a&para;<br>section that applies to all such claims, such as §2000e–5,&para;<br>which establishes the rules and remedies for all Title VII&para;<br>enforcement actions. See FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson&para;<br>Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 160 (2000). But in writing&para;<br>§2000e–2(m), Congress did neither of those things, and&para;<br>“[w]e must give effect to Congress’ choice.” Gross, supra,&para;<br>at 177, n. 3.&para;<br>The third problem with respondent’s and the Government’s reading of the motivating-factor standard is in its&para;<br>submission that this Court’s decisions interpreting federal&para;<br>antidiscrimination law have, as a general matter, treated&para;<br>bans on status-based discrimination as also prohibiting&para;<br>retaliation. In support of this proposition, both respondent and the United States rely upon decisions in which&para;<br>this Court has “read [a] broadly worded civil rights statute&para;<br>. . . as including an antiretaliation remedy.” CBOCS West,&para;<br>Inc. v. Humphries, 553 U. S. 442, 452–453 (2008). In&para;<br>CBOCS, for example, the Court held that 42 U. S.

Id., at 479, 487 (“All personnel actions&para;<br>affecting [federal] employees . . . who are at least 40 years&para;<br>of age . . . shall be made free from any discrimination&para;<br>based on age,” 29 U.

S. 229, 235, n. 3, 237 (1969) (42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1982).&para;<br>These decisions are not controlling here. It is true these&para;<br>cases do state the general proposition that Congress’&para;<br>enactment of a broadly phrased antidiscrimination statute&para;<br>may signal a concomitant intent to ban retaliation against&para;<br>individuals who oppose that discrimination, even where&para;<br>the statute does not refer to retaliation in so many words.&para;<br>What those cases do not support, however, is the quite&para;<br>different rule that every reference to race, color, creed, sex,&para;<br>or nationality in an antidiscrimination statute is to be&para;<br>treated as a synonym for “retaliation.” For one thing,&para;<br>§2000e–2(m) is not itself a substantive bar on discrimination. Rather, it is a rule that establishes the causation&para;<br>standard for proving a violation defined elsewhere in Title&para;<br>VII. The cases cited by respondent and the Government&para;<br>do not address rules of this sort, and those precedents are&para;<br>of limited relevance here.&para;<br>The approach respondent and the Government suggest&para;<br>is inappropriate in the context of a statute as precise,&para;<br>complex, and exhaustive as Title VII. As noted, the laws&para;<br>at issue in CBOCS, Jackson, and Gómez-Pérez were broad,&para;<br>general bars on discrimination. In interpreting them the&para;<br>Court concluded that by using capacious language Congress expressed the intent to bar retaliation in addition to&para;<br>status-based discrimination. See Gómez-Pérez, supra, at&para;<br>486–488. In other words, when Congress’ treatment of the&para;<br>subject of prohibited discrimination was both broad and&para;<br>brief, its omission of any specific discussion of retaliation&para;<br>was unremarkable.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

But that is not how Title VII was written, which&para;<br>makes it incorrect to infer that Congress meant anything&para;<br>other than what the text does say on the subject of retaliation. Unlike Title IX, §1981, §1982, and the federal-sector&para;<br>provisions of the ADEA, Title VII is a detailed statutory&para;<br>scheme. This statute enumerates specific unlawful employment practices. See §§2000e–2(a)(1), (b), (c)(1), (d)&para;<br>(status-based discrimination by employers, employment&para;<br>agencies, labor organizations, and training programs,&para;<br>respectively); §2000e–2(l) (status-based discrimination in&para;<br>employment-related testing); §2000e–3(a) (retaliation for&para;<br>opposing, or making or supporting a complaint about,&para;<br>unlawful employment actions); §2000e–3(b) (advertising a&para;<br>preference for applicants of a particular race, color, religion, sex, or national origin). It defines key terms, see&para;<br>§2000e, and exempts certain types of employers, see&para;<br>§2000e–1. And it creates an administrative agency with&para;<br>both rulemaking and enforcement authority.&para;<br>See&para;<br>§§2000e–5, 2000e–12.&para;<br>This fundamental difference in statutory structure&para;<br>renders inapposite decisions which treated retaliation as&para;<br>an implicit corollary of status-based discrimination. Text&para;<br>may not be divorced from context. In light of Congress’&para;<br>special care in drawing so precise a statutory scheme, it&para;<br>would be improper to indulge respondent’s suggestion that&para;<br>Congress meant to incorporate the default rules that apply&para;<br>only when Congress writes a broad and undifferentiated&para;<br>statute. See Gómez-Pérez, supra, at 486–488 (when construing the broadly worded federal-sector provision of the&para;<br>ADEA, Court refused to draw inferences from Congress’&para;<br>amendments to the detailed private-sector provisions);&para;<br>Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.

In the ADA Congress provided not&para;<br>just a general prohibition on discrimination “because of&para;<br>[an individual’s] disability,” but also seven paragraphs of&para;<br>detailed description of the practices that would constitute&para;<br>the prohibited discrimination, see §§102(a), (b)(1)–(7), id.,&para;<br>at 331–332 (codified at 42 U. S. C. §12112). And, most&para;<br>pertinent for present purposes, it included an express&para;<br>antiretaliation provision, see §503(a), 104 Stat. 370 (codified at 42 U. S. C. §12203). That law, which Congress&para;<br>passed only a year before enacting §2000e–2(m) and which&para;<br>speaks in clear and direct terms to the question of retaliation, rebuts the claim that Congress must have intended&para;<br>to use the phrase “race, color, religion, sex, or national&para;<br>origin” as the textual equivalent of “retaliation.” To the&para;<br>contrary, the ADA shows that when Congress elected to&para;<br>address retaliation as part of a detailed statutory scheme,&para;<br>it did so in clear textual terms.&para;<br>The Court confronted a similar structural dispute in&para;<br>Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156 (1981). The question&para;<br>there was whether the federal-employment provisions of&para;<br>the ADEA, 29 U. S.

This is of particular&para;<br>significance because claims of retaliation are being made&para;<br>with ever-increasing frequency. The number of these&para;<br>claims filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity&para;<br>Commission (EEOC) has nearly doubled in the past 15&para;<br>years—from just over 16,000 in 1997 to over 31,000&para;<br>in 2012.

Respondent’s&para;<br>retaliation claim, by contrast, relied on the theory that Dr.&para;<br>Fitz was committed to exonerating Dr. Levine and wished&para;<br>to punish respondent for besmirching her reputation.&para;<br>Separately instructed on each type of claim, the jury returned a separate verdict for each, albeit with a single&para;<br>damages award. And the Court of Appeals treated each&para;<br>claim separately, too, finding insufficient evidence on the&para;<br>claim of status-based discrimination.&para;<br>If it were proper to apply the motivating-factor standard&para;<br>to respondent’s retaliation claim, the University might&para;<br>well be subject to liability on account of Dr. Fitz’s alleged&para;<br>desire to exonerate Dr. Levine, even if it could also be&para;<br>shown that the terms of the affiliation agreement precluded the Hospital’s hiring of respondent and that the&para;<br>University would have sought to prevent respondent’s&para;<br>hiring in order to honor that agreement in any event.

NASSAR&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>result would be inconsistent with the both the text and&para;<br>purpose of Title VII.&para;<br>In sum, Title VII defines the term “unlawful employment practice” as discrimination on the basis of any of&para;<br>seven prohibited criteria: race, color, religion, sex, national&para;<br>origin, opposition to employment discrimination, and&para;<br>submitting or supporting a complaint about employment&para;<br>discrimination. The text of §2000e–2(m) mentions just the&para;<br>first five of these factors, the status-based ones; and it&para;<br>omits the final two, which deal with retaliation. When it&para;<br>added §2000e–2(m) to Title VII in 1991, Congress inserted&para;<br>it within the section of the statute that deals only with&para;<br>those same five criteria, not the section that deals with&para;<br>retaliation claims or one of the sections that apply to all&para;<br>claims of unlawful employment practices. And while the&para;<br>Court has inferred a congressional intent to prohibit retaliation when confronted with broadly worded antidiscrimination statutes, Title VII’s detailed structure makes that&para;<br>inference inappropriate here. Based on these textual and&para;<br>structural indications, the Court now concludes as follows:&para;<br>Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to&para;<br>traditional principles of but-for causation, not the lessened&para;<br>causation test stated in §2000e–2(m). This requires proof&para;<br>that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in&para;<br>the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the&para;<br>employer.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Respondent and the Government also argue that applying the motivating-factor provision’s lessened causation&para;<br>standard to retaliation claims would be consistent with&para;<br>longstanding agency views, contained in a guidance manual published by the EEOC. It urges that those views are&para;<br>entitled to deference under this Court’s decision in Skid­&para;<br>more v. Swift &amp; Co., 323 U. S. 134 (1944). See National&para;<br>Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>110, n. 6 (2002). The weight of deference afforded to&para;<br>agency interpretations under Skidmore depends upon “the&para;<br>thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of&para;<br>its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to&para;<br>persuade.” 323 U. S., at 140; see Vance, post, at 9, n. 4.&para;<br>According to the manual in question, the causation&para;<br>element of a retaliation claim is satisfied if “there is credible direct evidence that retaliation was a motive for the&para;<br>challenged action,” regardless of whether there is also&para;<br>“[e]vidence as to [a] legitimate motive.” 2 EEOC Compliance Manual §8–II(E)(1), pp. 614:0007–614:0008 (Mar.&para;<br>2003). After noting a division of authority as to whether&para;<br>motivating-factor or but-for causation should apply to&para;<br>retaliation claims, the manual offers two rationales in&para;<br>support of adopting the former standard. The first is that&para;<br>“[c]ourts have long held that the evidentiary framework&para;<br>for proving [status-based] discrimination . . . also applies&para;<br>to claims of discrimination based on retaliation.” Id., at&para;<br>614:0008, n. 45. Second, the manual states that “an interpretation . . . that permits proven retaliation to go unpunished undermines the purpose of the anti-retaliation&para;<br>provisions of maintaining unfettered access to the statutory&para;<br>remedial mechanism.” Ibid.&para;<br>These explanations lack the persuasive force that is a&para;<br>necessary precondition to deference under Skidmore. See&para;<br>323 U. S., at 140; Vance, post, at 9, n. 4. As to the first&para;<br>rationale, while the settled judicial construction of a particular statute is of course relevant in ascertaining statutory meaning, see Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580–&para;<br>581 (1978), the manual’s discussion fails to address the&para;<br>particular interplay among the status-based discrimination provision (§2000e–2(a)), the antiretaliation provision&para;<br>(§2000e–3(a)), and the motivating-factor provision&para;<br>(§2000e–2(m)). Other federal antidiscrimination statutes&para;<br>do not have the structure of statutory subsections that&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL&para;<br>CENTER v. NASSAR&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>control the outcome at issue here. The manual’s failure to&para;<br>address the specific provisions of this statutory scheme,&para;<br>coupled with the generic nature of its discussion of the&para;<br>causation standards for status-based discrimination and&para;<br>retaliation claims, call the manual’s conclusions into&para;<br>serious question. See Kentucky Retirement Systems v.&para;<br>EEOC, 554 U. S. 135, 149–150 (2008).&para;<br>The manual’s second argument is unpersuasive, too; for&para;<br>its reasoning is circular. It asserts the lessened causation&para;<br>standard is necessary in order to prevent “proven retaliation” from “go[ing] unpunished.” 2 EEOC Compliance&para;<br>Manual §8–II(E)(1), at 614:0008, n. 45. Yet this assumes&para;<br>the answer to the central question at issue here, which is&para;<br>what causal relationship must be shown in order to prove&para;<br>retaliation.&para;<br>Respondent’s final argument, in which he is not joined&para;<br>by the United States, is that even if §2000e–2(m) does not&para;<br>control the outcome in this case, the standard applied by&para;<br>Price Waterhouse should control instead. That assertion is&para;<br>incorrect. First, this position is foreclosed by the 1991&para;<br>Act’s amendments to Title VII. As noted above, Price&para;<br>Waterhouse adopted a complex burden-shifting framework. Congress displaced this framework by enacting&para;<br>§2000e–2(m) (which adopts the motivating-factor standard&para;<br>for status-based discrimination claims) and §2000e–&para;<br>5(g)(2)(B) (which replaces employers’ total defense with a&para;<br>remedial limitation). See Gross, 557 U. S., at 175, n. 2,&para;<br>177, n. 3, 178, n. 5. Given the careful balance of lessened&para;<br>causation and reduced remedies Congress struck in the&para;<br>1991 Act, there is no reason to think that the different&para;<br>balance articulated by Price Waterhouse somehow survived that legislation’s passage. Second, even if this argument were still available, it would be inconsistent with&para;<br>the Gross Court’s reading (and the plain textual meaning)&para;<br>of the word “because” as it appears in both §623(a) and&para;<br>§2000e–3(a).

The University claims that a fair application of this&para;<br>standard, which is more demanding than the motivatingfactor standard adopted by the Court of Appeals, entitles&para;<br>it to judgment as a matter of law.

This form of discrim­&para;<br>ination is commonly called “retaliation,” although Title VII&para;<br>itself does not use that term.

Today’s decision, however, drives a&para;<br>wedge between the twin safeguards in so-called “mixed­&para;<br>motive” cases. To establish discrimination, all agree, the&para;<br>complaining party need show only that race, color, reli­&para;<br>gion, sex, or national origin was “a motivating factor” in&para;<br>an employer’s adverse action; an employer’s proof that&para;<br>“other factors also motivated the [action]” will not defeat&para;<br>the discrimination claim. §2000e–2(m).

And jurors&para;<br>will puzzle over the rhyme or reason for the dual stand­&para;<br>ards.

In Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S.&para;<br>229, 237 (1969), the Court determined that 42 U. S.

Jackson v. Birmingham&para;<br>Board of Education elaborated on that holding in the&para;<br>context of sex discrimination. “Retaliation against a per­&para;<br>son because [he] has complained of sex discrimination,”&para;<br>the Court found it inescapably evident, “is another form of&para;<br>intentional sex discrimination.” 544 U.

It&para;<br>is a form of ‘discrimination’ because the complainant is&para;<br>being subject to differential treatment. Moreover, re­&para;<br>taliation is discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ because&para;<br>it is an intentional response to the nature of the com­&para;<br>plaint: an allegation of sex discrimination.” Id., at&para;<br>173–174 (citations omitted).&para;<br>Jackson interpreted Title IX of the Educational&para;<br>Amendments of 1972, 20 U.

Noting that&para;<br>the legislation followed three years after Sullivan, the&para;<br>Court found it “not only appropriate but also realistic to&para;<br>presume that Congress was thoroughly familiar with&para;<br>Sullivan and . . . expected its enactment of Title IX to be&para;<br>interpreted in conformity with it.” 544 U. S., at 176 (in­&para;<br>ternal quotation marks and alterations omitted).&para;<br>Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, 553 U. S. 474 (2008), was similarly&para;<br>reasoned. The Court there held that the federal-sector&para;<br>provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of&para;<br>1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S. C. §633a(a), barring discrimination&para;<br>“based on age,” also proscribes retaliation. 553 U.

Ibid.&para;<br>This vision of retaliation as a separate concept runs up&para;<br>against precedent. See supra, at 6–7. Until today, the&para;<br>Court has been clear eyed on just what retaliation is: a&para;<br>manifestation of status-based discrimination. As Jackson&para;<br>explained in the context of sex discrimination, “retalia­&para;<br>tion is discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ because it is&para;<br>an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an&para;<br>allegation of sex discrimination.” 544 U.

The&para;<br>Court did so mindful that another part of the Act, the&para;<br>provision applicable to private-sector employees, explicitly&para;<br>proscribes retaliation and, moreover, “set[s] out a specific&para;<br>list of forbidden employer practices.” Gómez-Pérez, 553&para;<br>U.

But, as our opinion in that case ob­&para;<br>serves, some of the ADEA’s provisions are brief, broad,&para;<br>and general, while others are extensive, specific, and&para;<br>detailed. 553 U.

It makes little sense&para;<br>to apply a different mode of analysis to Title VII’s §2000e–&para;<br>2(m) and the ADEA’s §633a(a), both brief statements on&para;<br>discrimination in the context of larger statutory schemes.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Court obscures the inconsistency between today’s opinion and&para;<br>Gómez-Pérez by comparing §633a to all of Title VII.

Section&para;<br>2000e–2, the Court asserts, “contains Title VII’s ban on&para;<br>status-based discrimination . . . and says nothing about&para;<br>retaliation.” Ante, at 13.

Section&para;<br>2000e–2 does not deal exclusively with discrimination&para;<br>based on protected characteristics. The provisions stated&para;<br>after §§2000e–2(a)–(d) deal with a variety of matters,&para;<br>some of them unquestionably covering retaliation. For&para;<br>example, §2000e–2(n), enacted in tandem with and located&para;<br>immediately after §2000e–2(m), limits opportunities to&para;<br>collaterally attack employment practices installed to im­&para;<br>plement a consent judgment.

Putting down the agency’s appraisal as “generic,”&para;<br>ante, at 22, is thus conspicuously unfair comment.&para;<br>The Court’s second reason for refusing to accord deference to the EEOC fares no better. The EEOC’s conclusion that “the lessened causation standard is necessary in&para;<br>order to prevent ‘proven retaliation’ from ‘go[ing] unpun­&para;<br>ished,’ ” the Court reasons, “is circular” because it “as­&para;<br>sumes the answer to the central question at issue here,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>which is what causal relationship must be shown in order&para;<br>to prove retaliation.” Ibid. That reasoning will not wash.&para;<br>Under the motivating-factor test set out in §2000e–2(m), a&para;<br>plaintiff prevails if she shows that proscribed conduct “was&para;<br>a motivating factor” for the adverse employment action&para;<br>she encountered, “even though other factors also motivated the [action].” She will succeed, although the relief to&para;<br>which she is entitled may be restricted. See supra, at 9.&para;<br>Under the Court’s view, proof that retaliation was a factor&para;<br>motivating an adverse employment action is insufficient to&para;<br>establish liability under §2000e–3(a). The Court’s but-for&para;<br>causation standard does not mean that the plaintiff has&para;<br>failed to prove she was subjected to unlawful retaliation.&para;<br>It does mean, however, that proof of a retaliatory motive&para;<br>alone yields no victory for the plaintiff. Put otherwise, the&para;<br>Court’s view “permits proven retaliation to go unpun­&para;<br>ished,” just as the EEOC recognized. See EEOC Compli­&para;<br>ance Manual, at 614:0008, n. 45.&para;<br>V&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Having narrowed §2000e–2(m) to exclude retaliation&para;<br>claims, the Court turns to Gross v. FBL Financial Ser­&para;<br>vices, Inc., 557 U. S. 167 (2009), to answer the question&para;<br>presented: Whether a plaintiff must demonstrate but-for&para;<br>causation to establish liability under §2000e–3(a).&para;<br>The Court held in Gross that, in contrast to Title VII,&para;<br>§623(a) of the ADEA does not authorize any age discrimi­&para;<br>nation claim asserting mixed motives. Explaining that&para;<br>uniform interpretation of the two statutes is sometimes&para;<br>unwarranted, the Court noted in Gross that the phrase&para;<br>“because of . . . age” in §623(a) has not been read “to bar&para;<br>discrimination against people of all ages, even though the&para;<br>Court had previously interpreted ‘because of . . . race [or]&para;<br>sex’ in Title VII to bar discrimination against people of all&para;<br>races and both sexes.” 557 U.

Instead, statutory lines should be&para;<br>crossed: The meaning of “because” in Title VII’s retaliation&para;<br>provision should be read to mean just what the Court held&para;<br>“because” means for ADEA-liability purposes. But see&para;<br>Gross, 557 U. S., at 174 (“When conducting statutory&para;<br>interpretation, we ‘must be careful not to apply rules&para;<br>applicable under one statute to a different statute without&para;<br>careful and critical examination.’ ”(quoting Holowecki, 552&para;<br>U. S., at 393)). In other words, the employer prevailed in&para;<br>Gross because, according to the Court, the ADEA’s anti­&para;<br>discrimination prescription is not like Title VII’s. But the&para;<br>employer prevails again in Nassar’s case, for there is no&para;<br>“meaningful textual difference,” ante, at 11, between the&para;<br>ADEA’s use of “because” and the use of the same word in&para;<br>Title VII’s retaliation provision. What sense can one make&para;<br>of this other than “heads the employer wins, tails the&para;<br>employee loses”?&para;<br>It is a standard principle of statutory interpretation that&para;<br>identical phrases appearing in the same statute—here,&para;<br>Title VII—ordinarily bear a consistent meaning. See&para;<br>Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551 U. S.&para;<br>224, 232 (2007). Following that principle, Title VII’s&para;<br>retaliation provision, like its status-based discrimination&para;<br>provision, would permit mixed-motive claims, and the&para;<br>same causation standard would apply to both provisions.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Court’s decision to construe §2000e–3(a) to require&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

Recall that Price&para;<br>Waterhouse interpreted “because of ” in §2000e–2(a) to&para;<br>permit mixed-motive claims. See supra, at 8. The Court&para;<br>today rejects the proposition that, if §2000e–2(m) does not&para;<br>cover retaliation, such claims are governed by Price Water­&para;<br>house’s burden-shifting framework, i.e., if the plaintiff&para;<br>shows that discrimination was a motivating factor in an&para;<br>adverse employment action, the defendant may escape&para;<br>liability only by showing it would have taken the same&para;<br>action had there been no illegitimate motive. It is wrong&para;<br>to revert to Price Waterhouse, the Court says, because the&para;<br>1991 Civil Rights Act’s amendments to Title VII abrogated&para;<br>that decision.&para;<br>This conclusion defies logic. Before the 1991 amend­&para;<br>ments, several courts had applied Price Waterhouse’s&para;<br>burden-shifting framework to retaliation claims.8 In the&para;<br>Court’s view, Congress designed §2000e–2(m)’s motivating­&para;<br>factor standard not only to exclude retaliation claims, but&para;<br>also to override, sub silentio, Circuit precedent applying the Price Waterhouse framework to such claims. And&para;<br>with what did the 1991 Congress replace the Price Water­&para;<br>house burden-shifting framework? With a but-for causa­&para;<br>tion requirement Gross applied to the ADEA 17 years&para;<br>after the 1991 amendments to Title VII. Shut from the&para;<br>Court’s sight is a legislative record replete with state­&para;<br>ments evincing Congress’ intent to strengthen antidis­&para;<br>crimination laws and thereby hold employers accountable&para;<br>for prohibited discrimination. See Civil Rights Act of&para;<br>1991, §2, 105 Stat. 1071; House Report Part II, at 18.

Ante, at&para;<br>18–19.&para;<br>Today’s opinion rehashes arguments rightly rejected in&para;<br>Price Waterhouse.

S., at 282, 286–287 (KENNEDY, J.,&para;<br>dissenting), and the common-law doctrines on which the&para;<br>dissent relied. As Justice O’Connor explained:&para;<br>“[I]n the area of tort liability, from whence the dis­&para;<br>sent’s ‘but-for’ standard of causation is derived, . . .&para;<br>the law has long recognized that in certain ‘civil cases’&para;<br>leaving the burden of persuasion on the plaintiff to&para;<br>prove ‘but-for’ causation would be both unfair and de­&para;<br>structive of the deterrent purposes embodied in the&para;<br>concept of duty of care. Thus, in multiple causation&para;<br>cases, where a breach of duty has been established,&para;<br>the common law of torts has long shifted the burden of&para;<br>proof to . . . defendants to prove that their negligent&para;<br>actions were not the ‘but-for’ cause of the plaintiff ’s&para;<br>injury.” Id., at 263–264 (concurring in judgment) (cit­&para;<br>ing Summers v.
