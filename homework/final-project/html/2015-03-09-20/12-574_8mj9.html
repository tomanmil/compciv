Respondents filed a tort suit against petitioner in&para;<br>Federal District Court in Nevada. The District Court dismissed the&para;<br>suit, finding that the Georgia search and seizure did not establish a&para;<br>basis to exercise personal jurisdiction in Nevada. The Ninth Circuit&para;<br>reversed, holding that the District Court could properly exercise jurisdiction because petitioner had submitted the false probable cause&para;<br>affidavit with the knowledge that it would affect persons with significant Nevada connections.&para;<br>Held: The District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over petitioner.&para;<br>Pp. 5–14.&para;<br>(a) The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause constrains a&para;<br>State’s authority to bind a nonresident defendant to a judgment of its&para;<br>courts, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 291,&para;<br>and requires that the nonresident have “certain minimum contacts”&para;<br>with the forum State, International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326&para;<br>U. S. 310, 316. The inquiry into the “minimum contacts” necessary to&para;<br>create specific jurisdiction focuses “on the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.” Keeton v. Hustler Magazine,&para;<br>Inc., 465 U. S. 770, 775. For a State to exercise jurisdiction consistent with due process, that relationship must arise out of contacts&para;<br>that the “defendant himself” creates with the forum, Burger King&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>WALDEN v. FIORE&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 475, and must be analyzed with&para;<br>regard to the defendant’s contacts with the forum itself, not with persons residing there, see, e.g., International Shoe, supra, at 319. The&para;<br>plaintiff cannot be the only link between the defendant and the forum. These same principles apply when intentional torts are involved. See Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S. 783, 788–789. Pp. 5–10.&para;<br>(b) Petitioner lacks the “minimal contacts” with Nevada that are a&para;<br>prerequisite to the exercise of jurisdiction over him. No part of petitioner’s course of conduct occurred in Nevada, and he formed no jurisdictionally relevant contacts with that forum. The Ninth Circuit&para;<br>reached its contrary conclusion by improperly shifting the analytical&para;<br>focus from petitioner’s contacts with the forum to his contacts with&para;<br>respondents, obscuring the reality that none of petitioner’s challenged conduct had anything to do with Nevada itself. Respondents&para;<br>emphasize that they suffered the “injury” caused by the delayed return of their funds while residing in Nevada, but Calder made clear&para;<br>that mere injury to a forum resident is not a sufficient connection to&para;<br>the forum. The proper question is whether the defendant’s conduct&para;<br>connects him to the forum in a meaningful way: Here, respondents’&para;<br>claimed injury does not evince such a connection. The injury occurred in Nevada simply because that is where respondents chose to&para;<br>be when they desired to use the seized funds. Other possible contacts&para;<br>noted by the Ninth Circuit—that respondents’ Nevada attorney contacted petitioner in Georgia, that cash seized in Georgia originated in&para;<br>Nevada, and that funds were returned to respondents in Nevada—&para;<br>are ultimately unavailing.

They found almost $97,000 in&para;<br>cash. Fiore explained to DEA agents in San Juan that she&para;<br>and Gipson had been gambling at a casino known as the&para;<br>El San Juan, and that they had residences in both California and Nevada (though they provided only California&para;<br>identification). After respondents were cleared for departure, a law enforcement official at the San Juan airport&para;<br>notified petitioner’s task force in Atlanta that respondents&para;<br>had boarded a plane for Atlanta, where they planned to&para;<br>catch a connecting flight to Las Vegas, Nevada.&para;<br>When respondents arrived in Atlanta, petitioner and&para;<br>another DEA agent approached them at the departure&para;<br>gate for their flight to Las Vegas.

After using a drug-sniffing dog to&para;<br>perform a sniff test, petitioner seized the cash.1 Petitioner&para;<br>advised respondents that their funds would be returned if&para;<br>they later proved a legitimate source for the cash.

In the end,&para;<br>no forfeiture complaint was filed, and the DEA returned&para;<br>the funds to respondents in March 2007.&para;<br>Respondents filed suit against petitioner in the United&para;<br>States District Court for the District of Nevada, seeking&para;<br>money damages under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971). Respondents alleged&para;<br>that petitioner violated their Fourth Amendment rights by&para;<br>(1) seizing the cash without probable cause; (2) keeping&para;<br>the money after concluding it did not come from drugrelated activity; (3) drafting and forwarding a probable&para;<br>cause affidavit to support a forfeiture action while knowing the affidavit contained false statements; (4) willfully&para;<br>seeking forfeiture while withholding exculpatory information; and (5) withholding that exculpatory information&para;<br>from the United States Attorney’s Office.&para;<br>The District Court granted petitioner’s motion to dismiss. Relying on this Court’s decision in Calder v. Jones,&para;<br>465 U. S. 783 (1984), the court determined that petitioner’s search of respondents and his seizure of the cash in&para;<br>Georgia did not establish a basis to exercise personal&para;<br>jurisdiction in Nevada. The court concluded that even if&para;<br>petitioner caused harm to respondents in Nevada while&para;<br>knowing they lived in Nevada, that fact alone did not&para;<br>confer jurisdiction.

FIORE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>whether venue was proper.&para;<br>On appeal, a divided panel of the United States Court of&para;<br>Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. The Court of&para;<br>Appeals assumed the District Court had correctly determined that petitioner’s search and seizure in Georgia&para;<br>could not support exercise of jurisdiction in Nevada. The&para;<br>court held, however, that the District Court could properly&para;<br>exercise jurisdiction over “the false probable cause affidavit aspect of the case.” 688 F. 3d 558, 577 (2011). According to the Court of Appeals, petitioner “expressly aimed”&para;<br>his submission of the allegedly false affidavit at Nevada by&para;<br>submitting the affidavit with knowledge that it would&para;<br>affect persons with a “significant connection” to Nevada.3&para;<br>Id., at 581. After determining that the delay in returning&para;<br>the funds to respondents caused them “foreseeable harm”&para;<br>in Nevada and that the exercise of personal jurisdiction&para;<br>over petitioner was otherwise reasonable, the court found&para;<br>the District Court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction to be&para;<br>proper.4 Id., at 582, 585. The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, with eight judges, in two separate opinions, dissenting.

In her view, the “false affidavit/forfeiture&para;<br>proceeding aspect” over which the majority found jurisdiction proper&para;<br>was not raised as a separate claim in the complaint, and she found it&para;<br>“doubtful that such a constitutional tort even exists.” Id., at 593. After&para;<br>the court denied rehearing en banc, the majority explained in a postscript that it viewed the filing of the false affidavit, which effected a&para;<br>“continued seizure” of the funds, as a separate Fourth Amendment&para;<br>violation.

Bauman, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 6).&para;<br>This is because a federal district court’s authority to assert&para;<br>personal jurisdiction in most cases is linked to service of&para;<br>process on a defendant “who is subject to the jurisdiction&para;<br>of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the&para;<br>district court is located.” Fed.

Rev. Stat.&para;<br>§14.065 (2011). Thus, in order to determine whether&para;<br>the Federal District Court in this case was authorized to&para;<br>exercise jurisdiction over petitioner, we ask whether the&para;<br>exercise of jurisdiction “comports with the limits imposed&para;<br>by federal due process” on the State of Nevada.

S. 457,&para;<br>463 (1940)).&para;<br>This case addresses the “minimum contacts” necessary&para;<br>to create specific jurisdiction.6 The inquiry whether a&para;<br>forum State may assert specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant “focuses on ‘the relationship among the&para;<br>defendant, the forum, and the litigation.’ ” Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U. S. 770, 775 (1984) (quoting&para;<br>Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186, 204 (1977)). For a State&para;<br>to exercise jurisdiction consistent with due process, the&para;<br>defendant’s suit-related conduct must create a substantial&para;<br>connection with the forum State. Two related aspects of&para;<br>this necessary relationship are relevant in this case.&para;<br>First, the relationship must arise out of contacts that&para;<br>the “defendant himself ” creates with the forum State.&para;<br>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 475 (1985).&para;<br>Due process limits on the State’s adjudicative authority&para;<br>principally protect the liberty of the nonresident defendant—not the convenience of plaintiffs or third parties. See&para;<br>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp., supra, at 291–292. We have&para;<br>consistently rejected attempts to satisfy the defendantfocused “minimum contacts” inquiry by demonstrating&para;<br>contacts between the plaintiff (or third parties) and the&para;<br>forum State. See Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia,&para;<br>S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408, 417 (1984) (“[The] unilateral&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 “Specific” or “case-linked” jurisdiction “depends on an ‘affiliatio[n]&para;<br>between the forum and the underlying controversy’ ” (i.e., an “activity or&para;<br>an occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is therefore&para;<br>subject to the State’s regulation”). Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations,&para;<br>S. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 2). This is in&para;<br>contrast to “general” or “all purpose” jurisdiction, which permits a court&para;<br>to assert jurisdiction over a defendant based on a forum connection&para;<br>unrelated to the underlying suit (e.g., domicile). Respondents rely on&para;<br>specific jurisdiction only.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>activity of another party or a third person is not an appropriate consideration when determining whether a defendant has sufficient contacts with a forum State to justify an&para;<br>assertion of jurisdiction”). We have thus rejected a plaintiff ’s argument that a Florida court could exercise personal jurisdiction over a trustee in Delaware based solely on&para;<br>the contacts of the trust’s settlor, who was domiciled in&para;<br>Florida and had executed powers of appointment there.&para;<br>Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235, 253–254 (1958). We&para;<br>have likewise held that Oklahoma courts could not exercise personal jurisdiction over an automobile distributor&para;<br>that supplies New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut&para;<br>dealers based only on an automobile purchaser’s act of&para;<br>driving it on Oklahoma highways. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp., supra, at 298. Put simply, however significant the plaintiff ’s contacts with the forum may be,&para;<br>those contacts cannot be “decisive in determining whether&para;<br>the defendant’s due process rights are violated.” Rush,&para;<br>444 U. S., at 332.&para;<br>Second, our “minimum contacts” analysis looks to the&para;<br>defendant’s contacts with the forum State itself, not the&para;<br>defendant’s contacts with persons who reside there. See,&para;<br>e.g., International Shoe, supra, at 319 (Due process “does&para;<br>not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment in personam against an individual . . . with which&para;<br>the state has no contacts, ties, or relations”); Hanson,&para;<br>supra, at 251 (“However minimal the burden of defending&para;<br>in a foreign tribunal, a defendant may not be called upon&para;<br>to do so unless he has had the ‘minimal contacts’ with that&para;<br>State that are a prerequisite to its exercise of power over&para;<br>him”). Accordingly, we have upheld the assertion of jurisdiction over defendants who have purposefully “reach[ed]&para;<br>out beyond” their State and into another by, for example,&para;<br>entering a contractual relationship that “envisioned continuing and wide-reaching contacts” in the forum State,&para;<br>Burger King, supra, at 479–480, or by circulating maga-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>WALDEN v. FIORE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>zines to “deliberately exploi[t]” a market in the forum&para;<br>State, Keeton, supra, at 781. And although physical presence in the forum is not a prerequisite to jurisdiction,&para;<br>Burger King, supra, at 476, physical entry into the State—&para;<br>either by the defendant in person or through an agent,&para;<br>goods, mail, or some other means—is certainly a relevant&para;<br>contact. See, e.g., Keeton, supra, at 773–774.&para;<br>But the plaintiff cannot be the only link between the&para;<br>defendant and the forum. Rather, it is the defendant’s&para;<br>conduct that must form the necessary connection with the&para;<br>forum State that is the basis for its jurisdiction over him.&para;<br>See Burger King, supra, at 478 (“If the question is whether&para;<br>an individual’s contract with an out-of-state party alone&para;<br>can automatically establish sufficient minimum contacts&para;<br>in the other party’s home forum, we believe the answer&para;<br>clearly is that it cannot”); Kulko v. Superior Court of Cal.,&para;<br>City and County of San Francisco, 436 U. S. 84, 93 (1978)&para;<br>(declining to “find personal jurisdiction in a State . . .&para;<br>merely because [the plaintiff in a child support action] was&para;<br>residing there”). To be sure, a defendant’s contacts with&para;<br>the forum State may be intertwined with his transactions&para;<br>or interactions with the plaintiff or other parties. But a&para;<br>defendant’s relationship with a plaintiff or third party,&para;<br>standing alone, is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction.&para;<br>See Rush, supra, at 332 (“Naturally, the parties’ relationships with each other may be significant in evaluating&para;<br>their ties to the forum. The requirements of International&para;<br>Shoe, however, must be met as to each defendant over&para;<br>whom a state court exercises jurisdiction”). Due process&para;<br>requires that a defendant be haled into court in a forum&para;<br>State based on his own affiliation with the State, not&para;<br>based on the “random, fortuitous, or attenuated” contacts&para;<br>he makes by interacting with other persons affiliated with&para;<br>the State. Burger King, 471 U. S., at 475 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>These same principles apply when intentional torts are&para;<br>involved. In that context, it is likewise insufficient to rely&para;<br>on a defendant’s “random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts” or on the “unilateral activity” of a plaintiff. Ibid.&para;<br>(same). A forum State’s exercise of jurisdiction over an&para;<br>out-of-state intentional tortfeasor must be based on intentional conduct by the defendant that creates the necessary&para;<br>contacts with the forum.&para;<br>Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S. 783, illustrates the application of these principles. In Calder, a California actress&para;<br>brought a libel suit in California state court against a&para;<br>reporter and an editor, both of whom worked for the National Enquirer at its headquarters in Florida. The plaintiff ’s libel claims were based on an article written and&para;<br>edited by the defendants in Florida for publication in the&para;<br>National Enquirer, a national weekly newspaper with a&para;<br>California circulation of roughly 600,000.&para;<br>We held that California’s assertion of jurisdiction over&para;<br>the defendants was consistent with due process. Although&para;<br>we recognized that the defendants’ activities “focus[ed]” on&para;<br>the plaintiff, our jurisdictional inquiry “focuse[d] on ‘the&para;<br>relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the&para;<br>litigation.’ ” Id., at 788 (quoting Shaffer, 433 U. S., at 204).&para;<br>Specifically, we examined the various contacts the defendants had created with California (and not just with the&para;<br>plaintiff) by writing the allegedly libelous story.&para;<br>We found those forum contacts to be ample: The defendants relied on phone calls to “California sources” for the&para;<br>information in their article; they wrote the story about the&para;<br>plaintiff ’s activities in California; they caused reputational injury in California by writing an allegedly libelous&para;<br>article that was widely circulated in the State; and the&para;<br>“brunt” of that injury was suffered by the plaintiff in that&para;<br>State. 465 U. S., at 788–789. “In sum, California [wa]s&para;<br>the focal point both of the story and of the harm suffered.”&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>WALDEN v. FIORE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Id., at 789. Jurisdiction over the defendants was “therefore proper in California based on the ‘effects’ of their&para;<br>Florida conduct in California.” Ibid.&para;<br>The crux of Calder was that the reputation-based “effects” of the alleged libel connected the defendants to&para;<br>California, not just to the plaintiff. The strength of that&para;<br>connection was largely a function of the nature of the libel&para;<br>tort. However scandalous a newspaper article might be, it&para;<br>can lead to a loss of reputation only if communicated to&para;<br>(and read and understood by) third persons. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §577, Comment b (1976); see also&para;<br>ibid. (“[R]eputation is the estimation in which one’s character is held by his neighbors or associates”). Accordingly,&para;<br>the reputational injury caused by the defendants’ story&para;<br>would not have occurred but for the fact that the defendants wrote an article for publication in California that was&para;<br>read by a large number of California citizens. Indeed,&para;<br>because publication to third persons is a necessary element of libel, see id., §558, the defendants’ intentional tort&para;<br>actually occurred in California. Keeton, 465 U. S., at 777&para;<br>(“The tort of libel is generally held to occur wherever the&para;<br>offending material is circulated”). In this way, the “effects” caused by the defendants’ article—i.e., the injury to&para;<br>the plaintiff ’s reputation in the estimation of the California public—connected the defendants’ conduct to California, not just to a plaintiff who lived there. That connection, combined with the various facts that gave the article&para;<br>a California focus, sufficed to authorize the California&para;<br>court’s exercise of jurisdiction.7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 The defendants in Calder argued that no contacts they had with&para;<br>California were sufficiently purposeful because their employer was&para;<br>responsible for circulation of the article. See Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S.&para;<br>783, 789 (1984). We rejected that argument. Even though the defendants did not circulate the article themselves, they “expressly aimed”&para;<br>“their intentional, and allegedly tortious, actions” at California because they knew the National Enquirer “ha[d] its largest circulation” in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

S., at 251. It is undisputed that no part of&para;<br>petitioner’s course of conduct occurred in Nevada. Petitioner approached, questioned, and searched respondents,&para;<br>and seized the cash at issue, in the Atlanta airport. It is&para;<br>alleged that petitioner later helped draft a “false probable&para;<br>cause affidavit” in Georgia and forwarded that affidavit to&para;<br>a United States Attorney’s Office in Georgia to support a&para;<br>potential action for forfeiture of the seized funds. 688&para;<br>F. 3d, at 563. Petitioner never traveled to, conducted&para;<br>activities within, contacted anyone in, or sent anything or&para;<br>anyone to Nevada. In short, when viewed through the&para;<br>proper lens—whether the defendant’s actions connect him&para;<br>to the forum—petitioner formed no jurisdictionally relevant contacts with Nevada.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion by&para;<br>shifting the analytical focus from petitioner’s contacts with&para;<br>the forum to his contacts with respondents. See Rush, 444&para;<br>U. S., at 332. Rather than assessing petitioner’s own&para;<br>contacts with Nevada, the Court of Appeals looked to&para;<br>petitioner’s knowledge of respondents’ “strong forum&para;<br>connections.” 688 F. 3d, at 577–579, 581. In the court’s&para;<br>view, that knowledge, combined with its conclusion that&para;<br>respondents suffered foreseeable harm in Nevada, satisfied the “minimum contacts” inquiry.8 Id., at 582.&para;<br>This approach to the “minimum contacts” analysis&para;<br>——————&para;<br>California, and that the article would “have a potentially devastating&para;<br>impact” there. Id., at 789–790.&para;<br>8 Respondents propose a substantially similar analysis. They suggest&para;<br>that “a defendant creates sufficient minimum contacts with a forum&para;<br>when he (1) intentionally targets (2) a known resident of the forum (3)&para;<br>for imposition of an injury (4) to be suffered by the plaintiff while she is&para;<br>residing in the forum state.” Brief for Respondents 26–27.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>WALDEN v. FIORE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>impermissibly allows a plaintiff ’s contacts with the defendant and forum to drive the jurisdictional analysis.&para;<br>Petitioner’s actions in Georgia did not create sufficient&para;<br>contacts with Nevada simply because he allegedly directed&para;<br>his conduct at plaintiffs whom he knew had Nevada connections. Such reasoning improperly attributes a plaintiff ’s forum connections to the defendant and makes those&para;<br>connections “decisive” in the jurisdictional analysis. See&para;<br>Rush, supra, at 332. It also obscures the reality that none&para;<br>of petitioner’s challenged conduct had anything to do with&para;<br>Nevada itself.&para;<br>Relying on Calder, respondents emphasize that they&para;<br>suffered the “injury” caused by petitioner’s allegedly tortious conduct (i.e., the delayed return of their gambling&para;<br>funds) while they were residing in the forum. Brief for&para;<br>Respondents 14. This emphasis is likewise misplaced. As&para;<br>previously noted, Calder made clear that mere injury to a&para;<br>forum resident is not a sufficient connection to the forum.&para;<br>Regardless of where a plaintiff lives or works, an injury is&para;<br>jurisdictionally relevant only insofar as it shows that the&para;<br>defendant has formed a contact with the forum State. The&para;<br>proper question is not where the plaintiff experienced a&para;<br>particular injury or effect but whether the defendant’s&para;<br>conduct connects him to the forum in a meaningful way.&para;<br>Respondents’ claimed injury does not evince a connection between petitioner and Nevada. Even if we consider&para;<br>the continuation of the seizure in Georgia to be a distinct&para;<br>injury, it is not the sort of effect that is tethered to Nevada&para;<br>in any meaningful way. Respondents (and only respondents) lacked access to their funds in Nevada not because&para;<br>anything independently occurred there, but because Nevada is where respondents chose to be at a time when they&para;<br>desired to use the funds seized by petitioner. Respondents&para;<br>would have experienced this same lack of access in California, Mississippi, or wherever else they might have&para;<br>traveled and found themselves wanting more money than&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

Unlike the broad publication of the forumfocused story in Calder, the effects of petitioner’s conduct on respondents are not connected to the forum State&para;<br>in a way that makes those effects a proper basis for&para;<br>jurisdiction.9&para;<br>The Court of Appeals pointed to other possible contacts&para;<br>with Nevada, each ultimately unavailing. Respondents’&para;<br>Nevada attorney contacted petitioner in Georgia, but that&para;<br>is precisely the sort of “unilateral activity” of a third party&para;<br>that “cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the&para;<br>forum State.” Hanson, 357 U. S., at 253. Respondents&para;<br>allege that some of the cash seized in Georgia “originated”&para;<br>in Nevada, but that attenuated connection was not created&para;<br>by petitioner, and the cash was in Georgia, not Nevada,&para;<br>when petitioner seized it. Finally, the funds were eventually returned to respondents in Nevada, but petitioner had&para;<br>nothing to do with that return (indeed, it seems likely that&para;<br>it was respondents’ unilateral decision to have their funds&para;<br>sent to Nevada).&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Well-established principles of personal jurisdiction are&para;<br>sufficient to decide this case. The proper focus of the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Respondents&para;<br>&para;<br>warn that if we decide petitioner lacks minimum contacts in this case, it will bring about unfairness in cases where intentional torts are committed via the Internet or other electronic means&para;<br>(e.g., fraudulent access of financial accounts or “phishing” schemes). As&para;<br>an initial matter, we reiterate that the “minimum contacts” inquiry&para;<br>principally protects the liberty of the nonresident defendant, not the&para;<br>interests of the plaintiff. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson,&para;<br>444 U. S., 286, 291–292 (1980). In any event, this case does not present&para;<br>the very different questions whether and how a defendant’s virtual&para;<br>“presence” and conduct translate into “contacts” with a particular&para;<br>State. To the contrary, there is no question where the conduct giving&para;<br>rise to this litigation took place: Petitioner seized physical cash from&para;<br>respondents in the Atlanta airport, and he later drafted and forwarded&para;<br>an affidavit in Georgia. We leave questions about virtual contacts for&para;<br>another day.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>WALDEN v. FIORE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“minimum contacts” inquiry in intentional-tort cases is&para;<br>“ ‘the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and&para;<br>the litigation.’ ” Calder, 465 U. S., at 788. And it is the&para;<br>defendant, not the plaintiff or third parties, who must&para;<br>create contacts with the forum State. In this case, the&para;<br>application of those principles is clear: Petitioner’s relevant conduct occurred entirely in Georgia, and the mere&para;<br>fact that his conduct affected plaintiffs with connections&para;<br>to the forum State does not suffice to authorize jurisdiction. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
