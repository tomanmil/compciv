BARACK H. OBAMA, &para;<br>&para;<br>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF&para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF&para;<br>&para;<br>COLUMBIA CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 08–1234. Decided March 1, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 558 U. S. ___ (2009), on the ques&para;<br>tion whether a federal court exercising habeas jurisdiction&para;<br>has the power to order the release of prisoners held at&para;<br>Guantanamo Bay “where the Executive detention is in&para;<br>definite and without authorization in law, and release into&para;<br>the continental United States is the only possible effective&para;<br>remedy,” Pet. for Cert. i. By now, however, each of the&para;<br>detainees at issue in this case has received at least one&para;<br>offer of resettlement in another country. Most of the&para;<br>detainees have accepted an offer of resettlement; five&para;<br>detainees, however, have rejected two such offers and are&para;<br>still being held at Guantanamo Bay.&para;<br>This change in the underlying facts may affect the legal&para;<br>issues presented. No court has yet ruled in this case in&para;<br>light of the new facts, and we decline to be the first to do&para;<br>so. See, e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7&para;<br>(2005) (“[W]e are a court of review, not of first view”).&para;<br>Under these circumstances, we vacate the judgment and&para;<br>remand the case to the United States Court of Appeals for&para;<br>the District of Columbia Circuit. It should determine, in&para;<br>the first instance, what further proceedings in that court&para;<br>or in the District Court are necessary and appropriate for&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KIYEMBA v. OBAMA&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>the full and prompt disposition of the case in light of the&para;<br>new developments.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
