Argued March 22, 2011—Decided June 20, 2011&para;<br>After petitioner borough fired respondent Guarnieri as its police chief,&para;<br>he filed a union grievance that led to his reinstatement. When the&para;<br>borough council later issued directives instructing Guarnieri how to&para;<br>perform his duties, he filed a second grievance, and an arbitrator or&para;<br>dered that some of the directives be modified or withdrawn. Guarni&para;<br>eri then filed this suit under 42 U. S. C. §1983, alleging that the di&para;<br>rectives were issued in retaliation for the filing of his first grievance,&para;<br>thereby violating his First Amendment “right . . . to petition the Gov&para;<br>ernment for a redress of grievances”; he later amended his complaint&para;<br>to allege that the council also violated the Petition Clause by denying&para;<br>his request for overtime pay in retaliation for his having filed the&para;<br>§1983 suit. The District Court instructed the jury, inter alia, that the&para;<br>suit and the grievances were constitutionally protected activity, and&para;<br>the jury found for Guarnieri. Affirming the compensatory damages&para;<br>award, the Third Circuit held that a public employee who has peti&para;<br>tioned the government through a formal mechanism such as the fil&para;<br>ing of a lawsuit or grievance is protected under the Petition Clause&para;<br>from retaliation for that activity, even if the petition concerns a mat&para;<br>ter of solely private concern. In so ruling, the court rejected the view&para;<br>of every other Circuit to have considered the issue that, to be pro&para;<br>tected, the petition must address a matter of public concern.&para;<br>Held: A government employer’s allegedly retaliatory actions against an&para;<br>employee do not give rise to liability under the Petition Clause unless&para;<br>the employee’s petition relates to a matter of public concern. The&para;<br>Third Circuit’s conclusion that the public concern test does not limit&para;<br>public employees’ Petition Clause claims is incorrect. Pp. 4–19.&para;<br>(a) A public employee suing his employer under the First Amend&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ment’s Speech Clause must show that he spoke as a citizen on a mat&para;<br>ter of public concern. Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 147. Even&para;<br>where the employee makes that showing, however, courts balance his&para;<br>employee’s right to engage in speech against the government’s inter&para;<br>est in promoting the efficiency and effectiveness of the public services&para;<br>it performs through its employees. Pickering v. Board of Ed. of&para;<br>Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 568. Al&para;<br>though cases might arise in which special Petition Clause concerns&para;<br>would require a distinct analysis, public employees’ retaliation claims&para;<br>do not call for this divergence. The close connection between the&para;<br>rights of speech and petition has led Courts of Appeals other than the&para;<br>Third Circuit to apply the public concern test to public employees’ Pe&para;<br>tition Clause claims. This approach is justified by the substantial&para;<br>common ground in the definition and delineation of these rights. Pp.&para;<br>4–8.&para;<br>(b) The substantial government interests that justify a cautious&para;<br>and restrained approach to protecting public employees’ speech are&para;<br>just as relevant in Petition Clause cases. A petition, no less than&para;<br>speech, can interfere with government’s efficient and effective opera&para;<br>tion by, e.g., seeking results that “contravene governmental policies&para;<br>or impair the proper performance of governmental functions,” Gar&para;<br>cetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 419. A petition taking the form of a&para;<br>lawsuit against the government employer may be particularly disrup&para;<br>tive, consuming public officials’ time and attention, burdening their&para;<br>exercise of legitimate authority, and blurring the lines of accountabil&para;<br>ity between them and the public. Here, for example, Guarnieri’s at&para;<br>torney invited the jury to review myriad details of government deci&para;<br>sionmaking. It is precisely to avoid this sort of intrusion into internal&para;<br>governmental affairs that this Court has held that, “while the First&para;<br>Amendment invests public employees with certain rights, it does not&para;<br>empower them to ‘constitutionalize the employee grievance.’ ” Id., at&para;<br>420. Interpreting the Petition Clause to apply even where matters of&para;<br>public concern are not involved would be unnecessary, or even dis&para;<br>ruptive, when there is already protection for the public employees’&para;<br>rights to file grievances and litigate. Adopting a different rule for Pe&para;<br>tition Clause claims would provide a ready means for public employ&para;<br>ees to circumvent the public concern test’s protections and aggravate&para;<br>potential harm to the government’s interests by compounding the&para;<br>costs of complying with the Constitution. Pp. 8–13.&para;<br>(c) Guarnieri’s claim that applying the public concern test to the&para;<br>Petition Clause would be inappropriate in light of the private nature&para;<br>of many petitions for redress lacks merit. Although the Clause un&para;<br>doubtedly has force and application in the context of a personal&para;<br>grievance addressed to the government, petitions to the government&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>assume an added dimension when they seek to advance political, so&para;<br>cial, or other ideas of interest to the community as a whole. The&para;<br>Clause’s history reveals the frequent use of petitions to address a&para;<br>wide range of political, social, and other matters of great public im&para;<br>port and interest. Pp. 13–17.&para;<br>(d) The framework used to govern public employees’ Speech Clause&para;<br>claims, when applied to the Petition Clause, will protect both the&para;<br>government’s interests and the employee’s First Amendment right. If&para;<br>a public employee petitions as an employee on a matter of purely pri&para;<br>vate concern, his First Amendment interest must give way, as it does&para;<br>in speech cases. San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77, 82–83. If he peti&para;<br>tions as a citizen on a matter of public concern, his First Amendment&para;<br>interest must be balanced against the government’s countervailing&para;<br>interest in the effective and efficient management of its internal af&para;<br>fairs. Pickering, supra, at 568. If that balance favors the public em&para;<br>ployee, the First Amendment claim will be sustained. If the balance&para;<br>favors the employer, the employee’s First Amendment claim will fail&para;<br>even though the petition is on a matter of public concern. As under&para;<br>the Speech Clause, whether a petition relates to a matter of public&para;<br>concern will depend on its “content, form, and context . . . , as re&para;<br>vealed by the whole record.” Connick, supra, at 147–148, n. 7. The&para;<br>forum in which a petition is lodged will also be relevant. See Snyder&para;<br>v. Phelps, 562 U. S. ___, ___. A petition filed with a government em&para;<br>ployer using an internal grievance procedure in many cases will not&para;<br>seek to communicate to the public or to advance a political or social&para;<br>point of view beyond the employment context. Pp. 17–18.&para;<br>(e) Absent full briefs by the parties, the Court need not consider&para;<br>how the foregoing framework would apply to this case. P. 19.&para;<br>364 Fed.

S.&para;<br>Const., Amdt. 1. This case concerns the extent of the&para;<br>protection, if any, that the Petition Clause grants public&para;<br>employees in routine disputes with government employ­&para;<br>ers. Petitions are a form of expression, and employees&para;<br>who invoke the Petition Clause in most cases could invoke&para;<br>as well the Speech Clause of the First Amendment. To&para;<br>show that an employer interfered with rights under the&para;<br>Speech Clause, the employee, as a general rule, must show&para;<br>that his speech was on a matter of public concern, as that&para;<br>term is defined in the precedents of this and other courts.&para;<br>Here the issue is whether that test applies when the&para;<br>employee invokes the Petition Clause.&para;<br>Alone among the Courts of Appeals to have addressed&para;<br>the issue, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has&para;<br>held that the public concern test does not limit Petition&para;<br>Clause claims by public employees. For the reasons stated&para;<br>below, this conclusion is incorrect.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>Charles Guarnieri filed a union grievance challenging&para;<br>his termination as chief of police for the borough of&para;<br>Duryea, a town of about 4,600 persons in northeastern&para;<br>Pennsylvania. His grievance proceeded to arbitration&para;<br>pursuant to the police union collective-bargaining agree­&para;<br>ment. The arbitrator found that the borough council,&para;<br>Duryea’s legislative body and the entity responsible for&para;<br>Guarnieri’s termination, committed procedural errors in&para;<br>connection with the termination; and the arbitrator also&para;<br>found that Guarnieri engaged in misconduct, including&para;<br>“attempting to intimidate Council members.” App. 37, 38.&para;<br>The arbitrator ordered Guarnieri reinstated after a disci­&para;<br>plinary suspension. Id., at 38.&para;<br>Upon Guarnieri’s return to the job, the council issued 11&para;<br>directives instructing Guarnieri in the performance of his&para;<br>duties. The council’s attorney explained that the council&para;<br>“wanted to be sure that the chief understood what was&para;<br>going to be expected of him upon his return.” Tr. 19:12–14&para;<br>(Apr. 16, 2008). One directive prohibited Guarnieri from&para;<br>working overtime without the council’s “express permis­&para;<br>sion.” App. 59, ¶1. Another indicated that “[t]he police&para;<br>car is to be used for official business only.” Id., at 60, ¶9.&para;<br>A third stated that the “Duryea municipal building is a&para;<br>smoke free building” and that the “police department is&para;<br>not exempt.” Id., at 61, ¶10. Guarnieri testified that,&para;<br>because of these and other directives, his “coming back&para;<br>wasn’t a warm welcome feeling.” Tr. 65:7–8 (Apr. 15,&para;<br>2008). Guarnieri filed a second union grievance challeng­&para;<br>ing the directives. The arbitrator instructed the council to&para;<br>modify or withdraw some of the directives on the grounds&para;<br>that they were vague, interfered with the authority of&para;<br>the mayor, or were contrary to the collective-bargaining&para;<br>agreement.&para;<br>Guarnieri filed this lawsuit against the borough, the&para;<br>borough council, and individual members of the council&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>under 42 U. S. C. §1983. Guarnieri claimed that his first&para;<br>union grievance was a petition protected by the Petition&para;<br>Clause of the First Amendment, and he alleged that the&para;<br>directives issued upon his reinstatement were retaliation&para;<br>for that protected activity.&para;<br>After this suit was filed, the council denied a request&para;<br>by Guarnieri for $338 in overtime. The United States&para;<br>Department of Labor investigated and concluded that&para;<br>Guarnieri was entitled to be paid. The council offered&para;<br>Guarnieri a check for the amount, but Guarnieri refused&para;<br>to accept it. Instead, Guarnieri amended his complaint to&para;<br>encompass the denial of overtime. Guarnieri alleged that&para;<br>his §1983 lawsuit was a petition and that the denial of&para;<br>overtime constituted retaliation for his having filed the&para;<br>lawsuit.&para;<br>Under the law of the Circuit, the defendants could not&para;<br>obtain judgment as a matter of law on the basis that&para;<br>the lawsuit and grievances were not on a matter of public&para;<br>concern. The case proceeded to a jury. Guarnieri’s attor­&para;<br>ney argued that the council was “sending a message to”&para;<br>Guarnieri through the directives and the denial of over­&para;<br>time: “You might have won your arbitration, but we con­&para;<br>trol you.” Tr. 53:24–25 (Apr. 17, 2008). The District Court&para;<br>instructed the jury that the lawsuit and union grievances&para;<br>were “protected activity . . . under the constitution,” and&para;<br>that the jury could find defendants liable if it found an&para;<br>adequate connection between the protected activity and&para;<br>the alleged retaliation. Id., at 61:17–20; 62. The jury&para;<br>found in favor of Guarnieri. The jury awarded $45,000 in&para;<br>compensatory damages and $24,000 in punitive damages&para;<br>for the directives, as well as $358 in compensatory dam­&para;<br>ages and $28,000 in punitive damages for the denial of&para;<br>overtime. The District Court awarded $45,000 in attor­&para;<br>ney’s fees and denied defendants’ renewed motion for&para;<br>judgment as a matter of law.&para;<br>Defendants appealed on the ground that Guarnieri’s&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>grievances and lawsuit did not address matters of public&para;<br>concern. Courts outside the Third Circuit have held that&para;<br>allegedly retaliatory actions by government employers&para;<br>against government employees may not give rise to liabil­&para;<br>ity under the Petition Clause unless the employee’s peti­&para;<br>tion related to a matter of public concern. See, e.g., Kirby&para;<br>v. Elizabeth City, 388 F. 3d 440, 448–449 (CA4 2004);&para;<br>Tang v. Rhode Island, Dept. of Elderly Affairs, 163 F. 3d 7,&para;<br>11–12 (CA1 1998); White Plains Towing Corp. v. Patter&para;<br>son, 991 F. 2d 1049, 1059 (CA2 1993). These courts rely&para;<br>on a substantial overlap between the rights of speech and&para;<br>petition to justify the application of Speech Clause pre­&para;<br>cedents to Petition Clause claims. They reason that,&para;<br>whether the grievance is considered under the Speech&para;<br>Clause or the Petition Clause, the government employer is&para;<br>entitled to take adverse action against the employee&para;<br>unless the dispute involves a matter of public concern.&para;<br>Rejecting that view, the Court of Appeals here affirmed&para;<br>the award of compensatory damages, although it found&para;<br>insufficient evidence to sustain the award of punitive&para;<br>damages. The Court of Appeals concluded that “ ‘a public&para;<br>employee who has petitioned the government through a&para;<br>formal mechanism such as the filing of a lawsuit or griev­&para;<br>ance is protected under the Petition Clause from retalia­&para;<br>tion for that activity, even if the petition concerns a matter&para;<br>of solely private concern.’ ” 364 Fed. Appx. 749, 753 (CA3&para;<br>2010) (quoting Foraker v. Chaffinch, 501 F. 3d 231, 236&para;<br>(CA3 2007)). The decision of the Court of Appeals was&para;<br>consistent with the rule adopted and explained by that&para;<br>court in San Filippo v. Bongiovanni, 30 F. 3d 424, 442&para;<br>(1994). This Court granted certiorari to resolve the con­&para;<br>flict in the Courts of Appeals. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>When a public employee sues a government employer&para;<br>under the First Amendment’s Speech Clause, the em­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ployee must show that he or she spoke as a citizen on a&para;<br>matter of public concern. Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138,&para;<br>147 (1983). If an employee does not speak as a citizen, or&para;<br>does not address a matter of public concern, “a federal&para;<br>court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the&para;<br>wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency&para;<br>allegedly in reaction to the employee’s behavior.” Ibid.&para;<br>Even if an employee does speak as a citizen on a matter of&para;<br>public concern, the employee’s speech is not automatically&para;<br>privileged. Courts balance the First Amendment interest&para;<br>of the employee against “the interest of the State, as an&para;<br>employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services&para;<br>it performs through its employees.” Pickering v. Board of&para;<br>Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391&para;<br>U. S. 563, 568 (1968).&para;<br>This framework “reconcile[s] the employee’s right to&para;<br>engage in speech and the government employer’s right to&para;<br>protect its own legitimate interests in performing its&para;<br>mission.” San Diego v. Roe, 543 U. S. 77, 82 (2004) (per&para;<br>curiam). There are some rights and freedoms so funda­&para;<br>mental to liberty that they cannot be bargained away in a&para;<br>contract for public employment. “Our responsibility is to&para;<br>ensure that citizens are not deprived of [these] fundamen­&para;<br>tal rights by virtue of working for the government.” Con&para;<br>nick, supra, at 147; see also Keyishian v. Board of Regents&para;<br>of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589, 605–606 (1967).&para;<br>Nevertheless, a citizen who accepts public employment&para;<br>“must accept certain limitations on his or her freedom.”&para;<br>Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 418 (2006). The gov­&para;<br>ernment has a substantial interest in ensuring that all of&para;<br>its operations are efficient and effective. That interest&para;<br>may require broad authority to supervise the conduct of&para;<br>public employees. “When someone who is paid a salary so&para;<br>that she will contribute to an agency’s effective operation&para;<br>begins to do or say things that detract from the agency’s&para;<br>effective operation, the government employer must have&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>some power to restrain her.” Waters v. Churchill, 511&para;<br>U. S. 661, 675 (1994) (plurality opinion). Restraints are&para;<br>justified by the consensual nature of the employment&para;<br>relationship and by the unique nature of the government’s&para;<br>interest.&para;<br>This case arises under the Petition Clause, not the&para;<br>Speech Clause. The parties litigated the case on the prem­&para;<br>ise that Guarnieri’s grievances and lawsuit are petitions&para;<br>protected by the Petition Clause. This Court’s precedents&para;<br>confirm that the Petition Clause protects the right of in­&para;<br>dividuals to appeal to courts and other forums estab­&para;<br>lished by the government for resolution of legal disputes.&para;<br>“[T]he right of access to courts for redress of wrongs is an&para;<br>aspect of the First Amendment right to petition the gov­&para;<br>ernment.” Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U. S. 883, 896–&para;<br>897 (1984); see also BE&amp;K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536 U. S.&para;<br>516, 525 (2002); Bill Johnson’s Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB,&para;<br>461 U. S. 731, 741 (1983); California Motor Transport Co.&para;<br>v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U. S. 508, 513 (1972). Al­&para;<br>though retaliation by a government employer for a public&para;<br>employee’s exercise of the right of access to the courts may&para;<br>implicate the protections of the Petition Clause, this case&para;<br>provides no necessity to consider the correct application of&para;<br>the Petition Clause beyond that context.&para;<br>Although this case proceeds under the Petition Clause,&para;<br>Guarnieri just as easily could have alleged that his em­&para;<br>ployer retaliated against him for the speech contained&para;<br>within his grievances and lawsuit. That claim would have&para;<br>been subject to the public concern test already described.&para;<br>Because Guarnieri chose to proceed under the Petition&para;<br>Clause, however, the Court of Appeals applied a more&para;<br>generous rule. Following the decision of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals in San Filippo, supra, at 443, Guarnieri was&para;<br>deemed entitled to protection from retaliation so long as&para;<br>his petition was not a “sham.” Under that rule, defen­&para;<br>dants and other public employers might be liable under&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the Petition Clause even if the same conduct would not&para;<br>give rise to liability under the Speech Clause. The ques­&para;<br>tion presented by this case is whether the history and&para;<br>purpose of the Petition Clause justify the imposition of&para;<br>broader liability when an employee invokes its protection&para;<br>instead of the protection afforded by the Speech Clause.&para;<br>It is not necessary to say that the two Clauses are iden­&para;<br>tical in their mandate or their purpose and effect to ac­&para;<br>knowledge that the rights of speech and petition share&para;<br>substantial common ground. This Court has said that the&para;<br>right to speak and the right to petition are “cognate&para;<br>rights.” Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 530 (1945); see&para;<br>also Wayte v. United States, 470 U. S. 598, 610, n. 11&para;<br>(1985). “It was not by accident or coincidence that the&para;<br>rights to freedom in speech and press were coupled in a&para;<br>single guaranty with the rights of the people peaceably to&para;<br>assemble and to petition for redress of grievances.” Tho&para;<br>mas, 323 U. S., at 530. Both speech and petition are&para;<br>integral to the democratic process, although not necessar­&para;<br>ily in the same way. The right to petition allows citizens&para;<br>to express their ideas, hopes, and concerns to their gov­&para;<br>ernment and their elected representatives, whereas the&para;<br>right to speak fosters the public exchange of ideas that is&para;<br>integral to deliberative democracy as well as to the whole&para;<br>realm of ideas and human affairs. Beyond the political&para;<br>sphere, both speech and petition advance personal expres­&para;<br>sion, although the right to petition is generally concerned&para;<br>with expression directed to the government seeking re­&para;<br>dress of a grievance.&para;<br>Courts should not presume there is always an essential&para;<br>equivalence in the two Clauses or that Speech Clause&para;<br>precedents necessarily and in every case resolve Petition&para;<br>Clause claims. See ibid. (rights of speech and petition are&para;<br>“not identical”). Interpretation of the Petition Clause&para;<br>must be guided by the objectives and aspirations that&para;<br>underlie the right. A petition conveys the special concerns&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of its author to the government and, in its usual form, re­&para;<br>quests action by the government to address those con­&para;<br>cerns. See Sure-Tan Inc., supra, at 896–897.&para;<br>This Court’s opinion in McDonald v. Smith, 472 U. S.&para;<br>479 (1985), has sometimes been interpreted to mean that&para;<br>the right to petition can extend no further than the right&para;<br>to speak; but McDonald held only that speech contained&para;<br>within a petition is subject to the same standards for&para;<br>defamation and libel as speech outside a petition. In those&para;<br>circumstances the Court found “no sound basis for grant­&para;<br>ing greater constitutional protection to statements made&para;<br>in a petition . . . than other First Amendment expres­&para;<br>sions.” Id., at 485. There may arise cases where the&para;<br>special concerns of the Petition Clause would provide a&para;<br>sound basis for a distinct analysis; and if that is so, the&para;<br>rules and principles that define the two rights might differ&para;<br>in emphasis and formulation.&para;<br>As other Courts of Appeals have recognized, however,&para;<br>claims of retaliation by public employees do not call for&para;<br>this divergence. See supra, at 4. The close connection&para;<br>between these rights has led Courts of Appeals other than&para;<br>the Third Circuit to apply the public concern test devel­&para;<br>oped in Speech Clause cases to Petition Clause claims by&para;<br>public employees. As will be explained further, this ap­&para;<br>proach is justified by the extensive common ground in the&para;<br>definition and delineation of these rights. The considera­&para;<br>tions that shape the application of the Speech Clause to&para;<br>public employees apply with equal force to claims by those&para;<br>employees under the Petition Clause.&para;<br>The substantial government interests that justify a&para;<br>cautious and restrained approach to the protection of&para;<br>speech by public employees are just as relevant when&para;<br>public employees proceed under the Petition Clause.&para;<br>Petitions, no less than speech, can interfere with the&para;<br>efficient and effective operation of government.

Govern­&para;<br>ment must have authority, in appropriate circumstances,&para;<br>to restrain employees who use petitions to frustrate pro­&para;<br>gress towards the ends they have been hired to achieve. A&para;<br>petition, like other forms of speech, can bring the “mission&para;<br>of the employer and the professionalism of its officers into&para;<br>serious disrepute.” Roe, 543 U. S., at 81. A public em­&para;<br>ployee might, for instance, use the courts to pursue per­&para;<br>sonal vendettas or to harass members of the general&para;<br>public. That behavior could cause a serious breakdown in&para;<br>public confidence in the government and its employees.&para;<br>And if speech or petition were directed at or concerned&para;<br>other public employees, it could have a serious and detri­&para;<br>mental effect on morale.&para;<br>When a petition takes the form of a lawsuit against the&para;<br>government employer, it may be particularly disruptive.&para;<br>Unlike speech of other sorts, a lawsuit demands a re­&para;<br>sponse. Mounting a defense to even frivolous claims may&para;<br>consume the time and resources of the government em­&para;<br>ployer. Outside the context of public employment, this&para;<br>Court has recognized that the Petition Clause does not&para;<br>protect “objectively baseless” litigation that seeks to “ ‘in­&para;<br>terfere directly with the business relationships of a&para;<br>competitor.’ ” Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v.&para;<br>Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U.

In&para;<br>recognition of the substantial costs imposed by litigation,&para;<br>Congress has also required civil rights plaintiffs whose&para;<br>suits are “frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation”&para;<br>to pay attorney’s fees incurred by defendants.

The government likewise&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>has a significant interest in disciplining public employees&para;<br>who abuse the judicial process.&para;<br>Unrestrained application of the Petition Clause in the context of government employment would subject a wide&para;<br>range of government operations to invasive judicial super­&para;<br>intendence. Employees may file grievances on a variety of&para;<br>employment matters, including working conditions, pay,&para;<br>discipline, promotions, leave, vacations, and terminations.&para;<br>See Brief for National School Boards Association as&para;<br>Amicus Curiae 5. Every government action in response&para;<br>could present a potential federal constitutional issue.&para;<br>Judges and juries, asked to determine whether the gov­&para;<br>ernment’s actions were in fact retaliatory, would be re­&para;<br>quired to give scrutiny to both the government’s response&para;<br>to the grievance and the government’s justification for its&para;<br>actions. This would occasion review of a host of collateral&para;<br>matters typically left to the discretion of public officials.&para;<br>Budget priorities, personnel decisions, and substantive&para;<br>policies might all be laid before the jury. This would raise&para;<br>serious federalism and separation-of-powers concerns. It&para;<br>would also consume the time and attention of public offi­&para;<br>cials, burden the exercise of legitimate authority, and blur&para;<br>the lines of accountability between officials and the public.&para;<br>This case illustrates these risks and costs. Guarnieri’s&para;<br>attorney invited the jury to review myriad details of gov­&para;<br>ernment decisionmaking. She questioned the council’s&para;<br>decision to issue directives in writing, rather than orally,&para;<br>Tr. 66 (Apr. 14, 2008); the council’s failure to consult the&para;<br>mayor before issuing the directives, id., at 105 (Apr. 15,&para;<br>2008); the amount of money spent to employ “Philadelphia&para;<br>lawyers” to defend Guarnieri’s legal challenges, id., at&para;<br>191–193:7–10 (Apr. 14, 2008); 152–153 (Apr. 16, 2008);&para;<br>and the wisdom of the council’s decision to spend money to&para;<br>install Global Positioning System devices on police cars,&para;<br>id., at 161–162 (same). Finally, the attorney invited the&para;<br>jury to evaluate the council’s decisions in light of an emo­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tional appeal on behalf of Guarnieri’s “little dog Hercules,&para;<br>little white fluffy dog and half Shitsu.” Id., at 49:13–14&para;<br>(Apr. 14, 2008). It is precisely to avoid this intrusion into&para;<br>internal governmental affairs that this Court has held&para;<br>that, “while the First Amendment invests public employ­&para;<br>ees with certain rights, it does not empower them to ‘con­&para;<br>stitutionalize the employee grievance.’ ” Garcetti, supra, at&para;<br>420 (quoting Connick, 461 U. S., at 154).&para;<br>If the Petition Clause were to apply even where matters&para;<br>of public concern are not involved, that would be unneces­&para;<br>sary, or even disruptive, when there is already protection&para;<br>for the rights of public employees to file grievances and to&para;<br>litigate. The government can and often does adopt statu­&para;<br>tory and regulatory mechanisms to protect the rights of&para;<br>employees against improper retaliation or discipline, while&para;<br>preserving important government interests. Cf. Garcetti,&para;<br>supra, at 425 (noting a “powerful network of legislative&para;<br>enactments”). Employees who sue under federal and state&para;<br>employment laws often benefit from generous and quite&para;<br>detailed antiretaliation provisions. See, e.g., Pa. Stat.&para;<br>Ann., Tit. 43, §1101.1201(a)(4) (Purdon 2009); §1101.1302.&para;<br>These statutory protections are subject to legislative revi­&para;<br>sion and can be designed for the unique needs of State,&para;<br>local, or Federal Governments, as well as the special&para;<br>circumstances of particular governmental offices and&para;<br>agencies. The Petition Clause is not an instrument for&para;<br>public employees to circumvent these legislative enact­&para;<br>ments when pursuing claims based on ordinary workplace&para;<br>grievances.&para;<br>In light of the government’s interests in the public&para;<br>employment context, it would be surprising if Petition&para;<br>Clause claims by public employees were not limited as&para;<br>necessary to protect the employer’s functions and respon­&para;<br>sibilities. Even beyond the Speech Clause, this Court has&para;<br>explained that “government has significantly greater&para;<br>leeway in its dealings with citizen employees than it does&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>when it brings its sovereign power to bear on citizens at&para;<br>large.” Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agriculture, 553 U. S.&para;<br>591, 599 (2008); see also NASA v. Nelson, 562 U. S. ___ ,&para;<br>___ (2011) (slip op., at 12). The government’s interest in&para;<br>managing its internal affairs requires proper restraints on&para;<br>the invocation of rights by employees when the workplace&para;<br>or the government employer’s responsibilities may be af­&para;<br>fected. There is no reason to think the Petition Clause&para;<br>should be an exception.&para;<br>The public concern test was developed to protect these&para;<br>substantial government interests. Adoption of a different&para;<br>rule for Petition Clause claims would provide a ready&para;<br>means for public employees to circumvent the test’s pro­&para;<br>tections. Consider Sheila Myers, who was the original&para;<br>plaintiff in Connick. She circulated “a questionnaire&para;<br>soliciting the views of her fellow staff members” on various&para;<br>office matters. 461 U. S., at 141. The Court held that&para;<br>Myers’ claim for retaliation failed the public concern test&para;<br>because the questionnaire was “most accurately character­&para;<br>ized as an employee grievance concerning internal office&para;<br>policy.” Id., at 154. It would undermine that principle if a&para;<br>different result would have obtained had Myers raised&para;<br>those same claims using a formal grievance procedure.&para;<br>Myers’ employer “reasonably believed [Myers’ complaints]&para;<br>would disrupt the office, undermine his authority, and&para;<br>destroy close working relationships.” Ibid. These con­&para;<br>cerns would be no less significant in the context of a for­&para;<br>mal grievance. Employees should not be able to evade the&para;<br>rule articulated in the Connick case by wrapping their&para;<br>speech in the mantle of the Petition Clause.&para;<br>Articulation of a separate test for the Petition Clause&para;<br>would aggravate potential harm to the government’s&para;<br>interests by compounding the costs of compliance with the&para;<br>Constitution. A different rule for each First Amendment&para;<br>claim would require employers to separate petitions from&para;<br>other speech in order to afford them different treatment;&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and that, in turn, would add to the complexity and ex­&para;<br>pense of compliance with the Constitution. Identifying peti­&para;<br>tions might be easy when employees employ formal griev­&para;<br>ance procedures, but the right to petition is not limited&para;<br>to petitions lodged under formal procedures. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U. S. 131 (1966). Indeed, the&para;<br>employee in Connick could have made a colorable argu­&para;<br>ment that her questionnaire ought to be viewed as a peti­&para;<br>tion for redress of grievances.&para;<br>Guarnieri claims application of the public concern test&para;<br>to the Petition Clause would be inappropriate in light of&para;<br>the private nature of many petitions for redress of griev­&para;<br>ances. The Petition Clause undoubtedly does have force&para;<br>and application in the context of a personal grievance&para;<br>addressed to the government. See, e.g., Trainmen v. Vir&para;<br>ginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1 (1964); Tho&para;<br>mas, 323 U. S., at 530–531. At the founding, citizens&para;<br>petitioned on a wide range of subjects, including matters&para;<br>of both private and public concern. Petitions to the colo­&para;<br>nial legislatures concerned topics as diverse as debt ac­&para;<br>tions, estate distributions, divorce proceedings, and re­&para;<br>quests for modification of a criminal sentence. Higginson,&para;<br>A Short History of the Right to Petition Government for&para;<br>the Redress of Grievances, 96 Yale L. J. 142, 146 (1986).&para;<br>Although some claims will be of interest only to the indi­&para;<br>vidual making the appeal, for that individual the need for&para;<br>a legal remedy may be a vital imperative. See, e.g.,&para;<br>M. L. B. v. S. L. J., 519 U. S. 102 (1996); Boddie v. Con&para;<br>necticut, 401 U. S. 371 (1971). Outside the public em­&para;<br>ployment context, constitutional protection for petitions&para;<br>does not necessarily turn on whether those petitions relate&para;<br>to a matter of public concern.&para;<br>There is, however, no merit to the suggestion that the&para;<br>public concern test cannot apply under the Petition Clause&para;<br>because the majority of petitions to colonial legislatures&para;<br>addressed matters of purely private concern. In analogous&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cases under the Speech Clause, this Court has noted the&para;<br>“Constitution’s special concern with threats to the right of&para;<br>citizens to participate in political affairs,” Connick, supra,&para;<br>at 145, even though it is likely that, in this and any other&para;<br>age, most speech concerns purely private matters. The&para;<br>proper scope and application of the Petition Clause like­&para;<br>wise cannot be determined merely by tallying up petitions&para;<br>to the colonial legislatures. Some effort must be made to&para;<br>identify the historic and fundamental principles that led&para;<br>to the enumeration of the right to petition in the First&para;<br>Amendment, among other rights fundamental to liberty.&para;<br>Petitions to the government assume an added dimension&para;<br>when they seek to advance political, social, or other ideas&para;<br>of interest to the community as a whole. Petition, as a&para;<br>word, a concept, and an essential safeguard of freedom, is&para;<br>of ancient significance in the English law and the AngloAmerican legal tradition. See, e.g., 1 W. Blackstone,&para;<br>Commentaries *143. The right to petition applied to peti­&para;<br>tions from nobles to the King, from Parliament to the&para;<br>King, and from the people to the Parliament, and it con­&para;<br>cerned both discrete, personal injuries and great matters&para;<br>of state.&para;<br>The right to petition traces its origins to Magna Carta,&para;<br>which confirmed the right of barons to petition the King.&para;<br>W. McKechnie, Magna Carta: A Commentary on the Great&para;<br>Charter of King John 467 (rev. 2d ed. 1958). The Magna&para;<br>Carta itself was King John’s answer to a petition from the&para;<br>barons. Id., at 30–38. Later, the Petition of Right of 1628&para;<br>drew upon centuries of tradition and Magna Carta as a&para;<br>model for the Parliament to issue a plea, or even a de­&para;<br>mand, that the Crown refrain from certain actions. 3 Car.&para;<br>1, ch. 1 (1627). The Petition of Right stated four principal&para;<br>grievances: taxation without consent of Parliament; arbi­&para;<br>trary imprisonment; quartering or billeting of soldiers;&para;<br>and the imposition of martial law. After its passage by&para;<br>both Houses of Parliament, the Petition received the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>King’s assent and became part of the law of England. See&para;<br>S. Gardiner, The First Two Stuarts and the Puritan Revo­&para;<br>lution, 1603–1660, pp. 60–61 (1886). The Petition of Right&para;<br>occupies a place in English constitutional history super­&para;<br>seded in importance, perhaps, only by Magna Carta itself&para;<br>and the Declaration of Right of 1689.&para;<br>The following years saw use of mass petitions to address&para;<br>matters of public concern. See 8 D. Hume, History of&para;<br>England from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolu­&para;<br>tion in 1688, p. 122 (1763) (“Tumultuous petitioning . . .&para;<br>was an admirable expedient . . . for spreading discontent,&para;<br>and for uniting the nation in any popular clamour”). In&para;<br>1680, for instance, more than 15,000 persons signed a&para;<br>petition regarding the summoning and dissolution of Par­&para;<br>liament, “one of the major political issues agitating the&para;<br>nation.” Knights, London’s ‘Monster’ Petition, 36 Histori­&para;<br>cal Journal 39, 40–43 (1993). Nine years later, the Decla­&para;<br>ration of Right listed the illegal acts of the sovereign and&para;<br>set forth certain rights of the King’s subjects, one of which&para;<br>was the right to petition the sovereign. It stated that “it&para;<br>is the Right of the Subjects to petition the King, and all&para;<br>Commitments and Prosecutions for such Petitioning are&para;<br>Illegal.” 1 W. &amp; M., ch. 2; see also L. Schwoerer, The&para;<br>Declaration of Rights, 1689, pp. 69–71 (1981).&para;<br>The Declaration of Independence of 1776 arose in the&para;<br>same tradition. After listing other specific grievances and&para;<br>wrongs, it complained, “In every stage of these Oppres­&para;<br>sions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble&para;<br>terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by&para;<br>repeated injury.” The Declaration of Independence ¶30.&para;<br>After independence, petitions on matters of public con­&para;<br>cern continued to be an essential part of contemporary&para;<br>debates in this country’s early history.

It&para;<br>attracted over 1,000 signatures. Laycock, supra, at 90,&para;<br>n. 153. During the ratification debates, Antifederalists&para;<br>circulated petitions urging delegates not to adopt the&para;<br>Constitution absent modification by a bill of rights. Boyd,&para;<br>Antifederalists and the Acceptance of the Constitution:&para;<br>Pennsylvania, 1787–1792, 9 Publius, No. 2, pp. 123, 128–&para;<br>133 (Spring 1979).&para;<br>Petitions to the National Legislature also played a&para;<br>central part in the legislative debate on the subject of&para;<br>slavery in the years before the Civil War. See W. Miller,&para;<br>Arguing About Slavery (1995). Petitions allowed partici­&para;<br>pation in democratic governance even by groups excluded&para;<br>from the franchise. See Mark, The Vestigial Constitution:&para;<br>The History and Significance of the Right to Petition, 66&para;<br>Ford. L. Rev. 2153, 2182 (1998). For instance, petitions by&para;<br>women seeking the vote had a role in the early woman’s&para;<br>suffrage movement. See Cogan &amp; Ginzberg, 1846 Petition&para;<br>for Woman’s Suffrage, New York State Constitutional&para;<br>Convention, 22 Signs 427, 437–438 (1997). The right to&para;<br>petition is in some sense the source of other fundamental&para;<br>rights, for petitions have provided a vital means for citi­&para;<br>zens to request recognition of new rights and to assert&para;<br>existing rights against the sovereign.&para;<br>Petitions to the courts and similar bodies can likewise&para;<br>address matters of great public import. In the context of&para;<br>the civil rights movement, litigation provided a means for&para;<br>“the distinctive contribution of a minority group to the&para;<br>ideas and beliefs of our society.” NAACP v. Button, 371&para;<br>U. S. 415, 431 (1963). Individuals may also “engag[e] in&para;<br>litigation as a vehicle for effective political expression and&para;<br>association, as well as a means of communicating useful&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>information to the public.” In re Primus, 436 U. S. 412,&para;<br>431 (1978). Litigation on matters of public concern may&para;<br>facilitate the informed public participation that is a cor­&para;<br>nerstone of democratic society. It also allows individuals&para;<br>to pursue desired ends by direct appeal to government&para;<br>officials charged with applying the law.&para;<br>The government may not misuse its role as employer&para;<br>unduly to distort this deliberative process. See Garcetti,&para;<br>547 U. S., at 419. Public employees are “the members of a&para;<br>community most likely to have informed and definite&para;<br>opinions” about a wide range of matters related, directly&para;<br>or indirectly, to their employment. Pickering, 391 U. S., at&para;<br>572. Just as the public has a right to hear the views of&para;<br>public employees, the public has a right to the benefit&para;<br>of those employees’ participation in petitioning activity.&para;<br>Petitions may “allow the public airing of disputed facts”&para;<br>and “promote the evolution of the law by supporting the&para;<br>development of legal theories,” NLRB, 536 U. S., at 532&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted), and these and other&para;<br>benefits may not accrue if one class of knowledgeable and&para;<br>motivated citizens is prevented from engaging in petition­&para;<br>ing activity. When a public employee seeks to participate,&para;<br>as a citizen, in the process of deliberative democracy,&para;<br>either through speech or petition, “it is necessary to regard&para;<br>the [employee] as the member of the general public he&para;<br>seeks to be.” Pickering, supra, at 574.&para;<br>The framework used to govern Speech Clause claims by&para;<br>public employees, when applied to the Petition Clause,&para;<br>will protect both the interests of the government and the&para;<br>First Amendment right. If a public employee petitions as&para;<br>an employee on a matter of purely private concern, the&para;<br>employee’s First Amendment interest must give way, as it&para;<br>does in speech cases. Roe, 543 U. S., at 82–83. When a&para;<br>public employee petitions as a citizen on a matter of public&para;<br>concern, the employee’s First Amendment interest must&para;<br>be balanced against the countervailing interest of the&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>government in the effective and efficient management of&para;<br>its internal affairs. Pickering, supra, at 568. If that&para;<br>balance favors the public employee, the employee’s First&para;<br>Amendment claim will be sustained. If the interference&para;<br>with the government’s operations is such that the balance&para;<br>favors the employer, the employee’s First Amendment&para;<br>claim will fail even though the petition is on a matter of&para;<br>public concern.&para;<br>As under the Speech Clause, whether an employee’s&para;<br>petition relates to a matter of public concern will depend&para;<br>on “the content, form, and context of [the petition], as&para;<br>revealed by the whole record.” Connick, 461 U. S., at 147–&para;<br>148, and n. 7. The forum in which a petition is lodged will&para;<br>be relevant to the determination of whether the petition&para;<br>relates to a matter of public concern. See Snyder v.&para;<br>Phelps, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 8–9). A peti­&para;<br>tion filed with an employer using an internal grievance&para;<br>procedure in many cases will not seek to communicate to&para;<br>the public or to advance a political or social point of view&para;<br>beyond the employment context.&para;<br>Of course in one sense the public may always be inter­&para;<br>ested in how government officers are performing their&para;<br>duties. But as the Connick and Pickering test has evolved,&para;<br>that will not always suffice to show a matter of public&para;<br>concern. A petition that “involves nothing more than a&para;<br>complaint about a change in the employee’s own duties”&para;<br>does not relate to a matter of public concern and accord­&para;<br>ingly “may give rise to discipline without imposing any&para;<br>special burden of justification on the government em­&para;<br>ployer.” United States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S.&para;<br>454, 466 (1995). The right of a public employee under the&para;<br>Petition Clause is a right to participate as a citizen,&para;<br>through petitioning activity, in the democratic process.

But the&para;<br>Court of Appeals did not consider whether the local gov&para;<br>ernment’s interest as an employer “in achieving its goals&para;<br>as effectively and efficiently as possible” nevertheless&para;<br>outweighs Guarnieri’s interest in petitioning the Federal&para;<br>Government regarding his local employment.

Our first opinion clearly saying that lawsuits&para;<br>are “Petitions” under the Petition Clause came less than&para;<br>40 years ago. In California Motor Transport Co. v. Truck&para;<br>ing Unlimited, 404 U. S. 508 (1972),1 an opinion by Justice&para;<br>Douglas, the Court asserted that “[t]he right of access to&para;<br>the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition.”&para;<br>Id., at 510. As authority it cited two habeas corpus cases,&para;<br>Johnson v. Avery, 393 U. S. 483 (1969), and Ex parte Hull,&para;<br>312 U. S. 546 (1941), neither of which even mentioned the&para;<br>Petition Clause. The assertion, moreover, was pure dic&para;<br>tum. The holding of California Motor Transport was that&para;<br>the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, a judicial gloss on the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Respondent would agree, since he cited this case in argument as the&para;<br>earliest. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36. There were, however, three cases in the&para;<br>1960’s which adverted vaguely to lawsuits as involving the right to&para;<br>petition. See Mine Workers v. Illinois Bar Assn., 389 U. S. 217, 222–&para;<br>224 (1967); Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar, 377 U. S. 1,&para;<br>7 (1964); NAACP v. Button, 371 U.

S., at&para;<br>510–512. The three other cases cited by the Court as&para;<br>holding that lawsuits are petitions, ante, at 6, are all&para;<br>statutory interpretation decisions construing the National&para;<br>Labor Relations Act, albeit against the backdrop of the&para;<br>Petition Clause. See BE&amp;K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536&para;<br>U. S. 516, 534–536 (2002); Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467&para;<br>U. S. 883, 896–897 (1984) Bill Johnson’s Restaurants, Inc.&para;<br>v. NLRB, 461 U. S. 731, 741–743 (1983). The Court has&para;<br>never actually held that a lawsuit is a constitutionally&para;<br>protected “Petition,” nor does today’s opinion hold that.&para;<br>The Court merely observes that “[t]he parties litigated the&para;<br>case on the premise that Guarnieri’s grievances and law&para;<br>suit are petitions protected by the Petition Clause,” ante,&para;<br>at 6, and concludes that Guarnieri’s 42 U. S. C. §1983&para;<br>claim would fail even if that premise were correct.&para;<br>I find the proposition that a lawsuit is a constitutionally&para;<br>protected “Petition” quite doubtful. The First Amend&para;<br>ment’s Petition Clause states that “Congress shall make&para;<br>no law . . . abridging . . . the right of the people . . . to&para;<br>petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” The&para;<br>reference to “the right of the people” indicates that the&para;<br>Petition Clause was intended to codify a pre-existing&para;<br>individual right, which means that we must look to&para;<br>historical practice to determine its scope. See District of&para;<br>Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 579, 592 (2008).&para;<br>There is abundant historical evidence that “Petitions”&para;<br>were directed to the executive and legislative branches of&para;<br>government, not to the courts. In 1765, the Stamp Act&para;<br>Congress stated “[t]hat it is the right of the British sub&para;<br>jects in these colonies to petition the King or either House&para;<br>of Parliament.” Declaration of Rights and Grievances,&para;<br>Art. 13, reprinted in 1 B.

As of 1781, seven state&para;<br>constitutions protected citizens’ right to apply or petition&para;<br>for redress of grievances; all seven referred only to legisla&para;<br>tive petitions. See Andrews, A Right of Access to Court&para;<br>Under the Petition Clause of the First Amendment: De&para;<br>fining the Right, 60 Ohio St. L. J. 557, 604–605, n. 159&para;<br>(1999). The Judiciary Act of 1789 did not grant federal&para;<br>trial courts jurisdiction to hear lawsuits arising under&para;<br>federal law; there is no indication anyone ever thought&para;<br>that this restriction infringed on the right of citizens to&para;<br>petition the Federal Government for redress of grievances.&para;<br>The fact that the Court never affirmed a First Amendment&para;<br>right to litigate until its unsupported dictum in 1972—&para;<br>after having heard almost 200 years’ worth of lawsuits,&para;<br>untold numbers of which might have been affected by a&para;<br>First Amendment right to litigate—should give rise to a&para;<br>strong suspicion that no such right exists. “[A] universal&para;<br>and long-established tradition of prohibiting certain con&para;<br>duct creates a strong presumption that the prohibition is&para;<br>constitutional: Principles of liberty fundamental enough to&para;<br>have been embodied within constitutional guarantees are&para;<br>not readily erased from the Nation’s consciousness.”&para;<br>Nevada Comm’n on Ethics v. Carrigan, ante, at 4 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>I acknowledge, however, that scholars have made de&para;<br>tailed historical arguments to the contrary.

U. L. Rev. 899, 903–962 (1997). As the Court’s&para;<br>opinion observes, the parties have not litigated the issue,&para;<br>and so I agree we should leave its resolution to another&para;<br>day.&para;<br>Second, and of greater practical consequence, I disagree&para;<br>with the Court’s decision to apply the “public concern”&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>framework of Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138 (1983), to&para;<br>retaliation claims brought under the Petition Clause. The&para;<br>Court correctly holds that the Speech Clause and Petition&para;<br>Clause are not co-extensive, ante, at 7–8. It acknowledges,&para;<br>moreover, that the Petition Clause protects personal&para;<br>grievances addressed to the government, ante, at 13. But&para;<br>that is an understatement—rather like acknowledging&para;<br>that the Speech Clause protects verbal expression. “[T]he&para;<br>primary responsibility of colonial assemblies was the&para;<br>settlement of private disputes raised by petitions.” Hig&para;<br>ginson, A Short History of the Right to Petition Govern&para;<br>ment for the Redress of Grievances, 96 Yale L. J. 142, 145&para;<br>(1986). “[T]he overwhelming majority of First Congress&para;<br>petitions presented private claims.” 8 Documentary His&para;<br>tory of the First Federal Congress 1789–1791, p. xviii (K.&para;<br>Bowling, W. DiGiacomantonio, &amp; C. Bickford eds. 1998).&para;<br>The Court nonetheless holds that, at least in public em&para;<br>ployment cases, the Petition Clause and Speech Clause&para;<br>should be treated identically, so that since the Speech&para;<br>Clause does not prohibit retaliation against public em&para;<br>ployees for speaking on matters of private concern, neither&para;<br>does the Petition Clause. The Court gives two reasons for&para;<br>this: First, “[a] different rule for each First Amendment&para;<br>claim would . . . add to the complexity and expense of&para;<br>compliance with the Constitution” and “would provide a&para;<br>ready means for public employees to circumvent the test’s&para;<br>protections,” and second, “[p]etitions to the government&para;<br>. . . assume an added dimension when they seek to ad&para;<br>vance political, social, or other ideas of interest to the&para;<br>community as a whole.” Ante, at 12–14.&para;<br>Neither reason is persuasive. As to the former: The&para;<br>complexity of treating the Petition Clause and Speech&para;<br>Clause separately is attributable to the inconsiderate&para;<br>disregard for judicial convenience displayed by those who&para;<br>ratified a First Amendment that included both provisions&para;<br>as separate constitutional rights. A plaintiff does not&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>engage in pernicious “circumvention” of our Speech&para;<br>Clause precedents when he brings a claim premised on a&para;<br>separate enumerated right to which those precedents are&para;<br>inapplicable.&para;<br>As to the latter: Perhaps petitions on matters of public&para;<br>concern do in some sense involve an “added dimension,”&para;<br>but that “added dimension” does not obliterate what has&para;<br>traditionally been the principal dimension of the Petition&para;<br>Clause. The public-concern limitation makes sense in the&para;<br>context of the Speech Clause, because it is speech on mat&para;<br>ters of public concern that lies “within the core of First&para;<br>Amendment protection.” Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of Agri&para;<br>culture, 553 U. S. 591, 600 (2008). The Speech Clause&para;<br>“has its fullest and most urgent application to speech&para;<br>uttered during a campaign for political office.” Citizens&para;<br>United v. Federal Election Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2010) (slip op., at 23) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>The unique protection granted to political speech is&para;<br>grounded in the history of the Speech Clause, which “was&para;<br>fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the&para;<br>bringing about of political and social changes desired by&para;<br>the people.” Connick, supra, at 145 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted).&para;<br>But the mere fact that we have a longstanding tradition&para;<br>of granting heightened protection to speech of public con&para;<br>cern does not suggest that a “public concern” requirement&para;<br>should be written into other constitutional provisions. We&para;<br>would not say that religious proselytizing is entitled to&para;<br>more protection under the Free Exercise Clause than&para;<br>private religious worship because public proclamations are&para;<br>“core free exercise activity.” Nor would we say that the&para;<br>due process right to a neutral adjudicator is heightened in&para;<br>the context of litigation of national importance because&para;<br>such litigation is somehow at the “core of the due process&para;<br>guarantee.” Likewise, given that petitions to redress&para;<br>private grievances were such a high proportion of petitions&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>at the founding—a proportion that is infinitely higher if&para;<br>lawsuits are considered to be petitions—it is ahistorical to&para;<br>say that petitions on matters of public concern constitute&para;<br>“core petitioning activity.” In the Court’s view, if Guar&para;<br>nieri had submitted a letter to one of the borough of&para;<br>Duryea’s council members protesting a tax assessment&para;<br>that he claimed was mistaken; and if the borough had&para;<br>fired him in retaliation for that petition; Guarnieri would&para;<br>have no claim for a Petition Clause violation. That has to&para;<br>be wrong. It takes no account of, and thus frustrates, the&para;<br>principal purpose of the Petition Clause.&para;<br>The Court responds that “[t]he proper scope and appli&para;<br>cation of the Petition Clause . . . cannot be determined&para;<br>merely by tallying up petitions to the colonial legisla&para;<br>tures,” ante, at 14, but that misses the point. The text of&para;<br>the Petition Clause does not distinguish petitions of public&para;<br>concern from petitions of private concern. Accordingly,&para;<br>there should be no doctrinal distinction between them&para;<br>unless the history or tradition of the Petition Clause justi&para;<br>fies it. The mere fact that the Court can enumerate sev&para;<br>eral historical petitions of public importance, ante, at 14–&para;<br>16, does not establish such a tradition, given that peti&para;<br>tions for redress of private grievances vastly outnumbered&para;<br>them. Indeed, the Court’s holding is contrary to this&para;<br>Court’s historical treatment of the Petition Clause, assum&para;<br>ing (as the Court believes) that the Clause embraces liti&para;<br>gation: We have decided innumerable cases establishing&para;<br>constitutional rights with respect to litigation, and until&para;<br>today not a one of them has so much as hinted that litiga&para;<br>tion of public concern enjoys more of those rights than&para;<br>litigation of private concern. The Court’s belief in the&para;<br>social importance of public petitions, and its reminiscences&para;<br>of some of the public-petition greats of yesteryear, ibid., do&para;<br>not justify the proclamation of special constitutional rights&para;<br>for public petitions. It is the Constitution that establishes&para;<br>constitutional rights, not the Justices’ notions of what is&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>important, or the top numbers on their Petition Hit Pa&para;<br>rade. And there is no basis for believing that the Petition&para;<br>Clause gives special protection to public petitions.&para;<br>Rather than shoehorning the “public concern” doctrine&para;<br>into a Clause where it does not fit, we should hold that&para;<br>the Petition Clause protects public employees against re&para;<br>taliation for filing petitions unless those petitions are ad&para;<br>dressed to the government in its capacity as the petition&para;<br>ers’ employer, rather than its capacity as their sovereign.&para;<br>As the Court states, we have long held that “government&para;<br>has significantly greater leeway in its dealings with citi&para;<br>zen employees than it does when it brings its sovereign&para;<br>power to bear on citizens at large.” Ante, at 11–12 (quot&para;<br>ing Engquist, supra, at 599; internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). To apply to the Petition Clause context what we&para;<br>have said regarding the Speech Clause: When an em&para;<br>ployee files a petition with the government in its capacity&para;<br>as his employer, he is not acting “as [a] citize[n] for First&para;<br>Amendment purposes,” because “there is no relevant&para;<br>analogue to [petitions] by citizens who are not government&para;<br>employees.” Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410, 421, 423–&para;<br>424 (2006). To be sure, the line between a petition ad&para;<br>dressed to government as the petitioner’s employer and&para;<br>one addressed to it as sovereign is not always clear, but it&para;<br>is no more fuzzy than the line between matters of private&para;<br>and matters of public concern.2 The criterion I suggest&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Compare,&para;<br>&para;<br>e.g., Alpha Energy Savers, Inc. v. Hansen, 381 F. 3d 917,&para;<br>927 (CA9 2004) (testimony concerning claim of employment discrimina&para;<br>tion by government contractor constituted matter of public concern&para;<br>because “[l]itigation seeking to expose . . . wrongful governmental&para;<br>activity is, by its very nature, a matter of public concern”), with Padilla&para;<br>v. South Harrison R-II School Dist., 181 F. 3d 992, 997 (CA8 1999)&para;<br>(teacher’s testimony approving sexual relationship between teacher and&para;<br>minor was matter of private concern because it “does not relate to the&para;<br>teacher’s legitimate disagreement with a school board’s policies”). And&para;<br>compare, e.g., Voigt v. Savell, 70 F. 3d 1552, 1560 (CA9 1995) (speech&para;<br>regarding how judge handled two internal personnel matters was&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BOROUGH OF DURYEA v. GUARNIERI&para;<br>Opinion of SCALIA, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>would largely resolve the legitimate practical concerns&para;<br>identified by the Court, ante, at 10–12, while recognizing&para;<br>and giving effect to the difference between the Speech and&para;<br>Petition Clauses.&para;<br>Under what I think to be the proper test, the Third&para;<br>Circuit judgment before us here should be reversed in part&para;<br>and affirmed in part. The portion of it upholding Guarni&para;<br>eri’s claim of retaliation for having filed his union griev&para;<br>ance must be reversed. A union grievance is the epitome&para;<br>of a petition addressed to the government in its capacity&para;<br>as the petitioner’s employer. No analogous petitions to the&para;<br>government could have been filed by private citizens, who&para;<br>are not even permitted to avail themselves of Guarnieri’s&para;<br>union grievance procedure. Contrariwise, the portion of&para;<br>the judgment upholding Guarnieri’s claim of retaliation&para;<br>for having filed his §1983 claim must be affirmed. Given&para;<br>that Guarnieri was not an employee of the Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment, it is impossible to say that the §1983 claim was&para;<br>addressed to government in its capacity as his employer. I&para;<br>think it clear that retaliating against a state employee for&para;<br>writing a letter to his Congressman about his state job&para;<br>would run afoul of the Petition Clause. Assuming that the&para;<br>§1983 lawsuit should be treated like a letter to a Con&para;<br>gressman for Petition Clause purposes—a proposition&para;<br>which, I again emphasize, is doubtful, but which the par&para;<br>ties do not dispute in this case—retaliation for having filed&para;<br>his lawsuit also violates the Clause.&para;<br>&para;<br>——————&para;<br>matter of public concern because “[t]he public has an interest in know&para;<br>ing whether the court treats its job applicants fairly”), with Maggio v.&para;<br>Sipple, 211 F. 3d 1346, 1353 (CA11 2000) (testimony at hearing con&para;<br>cerning employee grievance was matter of private concern because it&para;<br>did “not allege . . . fraud or corruption in [defendant’s] implementation&para;<br>of its personnel policies and appeal procedures”).&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
