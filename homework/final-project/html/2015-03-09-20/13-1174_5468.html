ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 13–1174. Argued December 9, 2014—Decided January 21, 2015&para;<br>Three legal prescriptions figure in this case. Title 28 U. S. C. §1291&para;<br>gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction over appeals from “all final&para;<br>decisions of the district courts of the United States,” and its core application is to rulings that terminate an action. Federal Rule of Civil&para;<br>Procedure 54(b) permits district courts to authorize immediate appeal of dispositive rulings on separate claims in a civil action raising&para;<br>multiple claims. And 28 U. S. C. §1407 authorizes the Judicial Panel&para;<br>on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) to transfer civil actions “involving&para;<br>one or more common questions of fact . . . to any district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings” in order to “promote the&para;<br>just and efficient conduct of such actions,” §1407(a).&para;<br>The London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a reference point&para;<br>in determining interest rates for financial instruments in the United&para;<br>States and globally. The JPML established a multidistrict litigation&para;<br>(LIBOR MDL) for cases involving allegations that defendant-banks&para;<br>understated their borrowing costs, thereby depressing LIBOR and&para;<br>enabling the banks to pay lower interest rates on financial instruments sold to investors. Over 60 actions were consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of&para;<br>New York, including a class action filed by petitioners Ellen Gelboim&para;<br>and Linda Zacher, who raised the single claim that several banks,&para;<br>acting in concert, had violated federal antitrust law. Determining&para;<br>that no plaintiff could assert a cognizable antitrust injury, the District Court granted the banks’ motion to dismiss all antitrust claims,&para;<br>including the Gelboim-Zacher complaint’s sole claim. The District&para;<br>Court thus dismissed the Gelboim-Zacher complaint, denied leave to&para;<br>amend, and dismissed the case in its entirety. Other cases made part&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GELBOIM v. BANK OF AMERICA CORP.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>of the LIBOR MDL, however, presented discrete claims which remained before the District Court. Assuming that the Gelboim-Zacher&para;<br>plaintiffs were entitled to an immediate appeal of right under §1291,&para;<br>the District Court granted Rule 54(b) certifications authorizing the&para;<br>plaintiffs in some of the multiple-claim actions to appeal the dismissal of their antitrust claims while their other claims remained pending in the District Court. On its own initiative, the Second Circuit&para;<br>dismissed the Gelboim-Zacher appeal because the order appealed&para;<br>from did not dispose of all of the claims in the consolidated action.&para;<br>The District Court thereafter withdrew its Rule 54(b) certifications.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The order dismissing their case in its entirety removed Gelboim&para;<br>and Zacher from the consolidated proceeding, thereby triggering their&para;<br>right to appeal under §1291.&para;<br>Because cases consolidated for MDL pretrial proceedings ordinarily&para;<br>retain their separate identities, an order disposing of one of the discrete cases in its entirety should qualify under §1291 as an appealable final decision. Section 1407 refers to individual “actions” transferrable to a single district court, not to a monolithic multidistrict&para;<br>“action” created by transfer. See Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach, 523 U. S. 26, 37. And §1407(a)’s language—“at&para;<br>or before the conclusion of . . . pretrial proceedings,” each transferred&para;<br>action must be remanded to the originating district “unless [the action] shall have been previously terminated”—indicates Congress’ anticipation that, during the pendency of pretrial proceedings, final decisions might be rendered in one or more of the actions consolidated&para;<br>pursuant to §1407. The District Court’s order dismissing the Gelboim-Zacher complaint was a final decision. The District Court completed its adjudication of petitioners’ complaint and terminated their&para;<br>action. Petitioners thus are no longer participants in the consolidated proceedings. Nothing about the initial consolidation of their civil&para;<br>action with other LIBOR MDL cases renders the dismissal of their&para;<br>complaint tentative or incomplete.&para;<br>To hold, as the banks contend, that no appeal of right accrues until&para;<br>a §1407 consolidation ends would leave plaintiffs like Gelboim and&para;<br>Zacher in a quandary about the event that triggers the 30-day period&para;<br>for taking an appeal. The sensible solution to the appeal-clock trigger is to allow an immediate appeal in a case such as this, where the&para;<br>transferee court in an MDL grants a defendant’s dispositive motion&para;<br>on every claim (or the sole claim) in a transferred case. The banks&para;<br>are also concerned about allowing plaintiffs with the weakest cases to&para;<br>appeal because their complaint states only one claim, while leaving&para;<br>those with stronger cases unable to appeal simultaneously because&para;<br>they have other pending claims. But that concern is attended to by&para;<br>Rule 54(b), which authorizes district courts to grant certifications to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>parties with multiple-claim complaints, thereby enabling plaintiffs in&para;<br>actions that have not been dismissed in their entirety to pursue immediate appellate review of discrete claims. The District Court did&para;<br>that in this very case. Rule 54(b), however, is of no avail to Gelboim&para;<br>and Zacher, who asserted only one claim. See Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.&para;<br>v. Mackey, 351 U. S. 427, 435. Section 1292(b)—which allows district&para;<br>courts to designate for review certain interlocutory orders—is also&para;<br>inapposite here, for there is nothing “interlocutory” about the dismissal order in the Gelboim-Zacher action.

We reverse the&para;<br>Second Circuit’s judgment and hold that the GelboimZacher complaint retained its independent status for&para;<br>purposes of appellate jurisdiction under §1291. Petitioners’ right to appeal ripened when the District Court dismissed their case, not upon eventual completion of multidistrict proceedings in all of the consolidated cases.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Three legal prescriptions figure in this case: Title 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §§1291 and 1407, and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).&para;<br>Section 1291 gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction over&para;<br>appeals from “all final decisions of the district courts of the&para;<br>United States.” A “final decision” is one “by which a district court disassociates itself from a case.” Swint v.&para;<br>Chambers County Comm’n, 514 U. S. 35, 42 (1995). While&para;<br>decisions of this Court have accorded §1291 a “practical&para;<br>rather than a technical construction,” Mohawk Industries,&para;<br>Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U. S. 100, 106 (2009) (quoting Cohen&para;<br>v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.

S.&para;<br>229, 233 (1945) (final decision is “one which ends the&para;<br>litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to&para;<br>do but execute the judgment”).&para;<br>Rule 54(b) permits district courts to authorize immediate appeal of dispositive rulings on separate claims in a&para;<br>civil action raising multiple claims:&para;<br>“When an action presents more than one claim for relief . . . or when multiple parties are involved, the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U.

S. 427, 434 (1956). The Federal Rules&para;<br>allow a plaintiff to “state [in one complaint] as many&para;<br>separate claims . . . as it has.” Rule 8(d)(3). Rule 54(b)&para;<br>was adopted in view of the breadth of the “civil action” the&para;<br>Rules allow, specifically “to avoid the possible injustice” of&para;<br>“delay[ing] judgment o[n] a distinctly separate claim&para;<br>[pending] adjudication of the entire case.” Report of Advisory Committee on Proposed Amendments to Rules of&para;<br>Civil Procedure 70 (1946) (explaining that Rule 54(b) was&para;<br>recast in 1946 to avoid confusion and misapplication); see&para;<br>Dickinson v. Petroleum Conversion Corp., 338 U. S. 507,&para;<br>511 (1950) (Rule 54(b) responded to liberalized joinder of&para;<br>claims and parties under the Federal Rules, which “increased the danger of hardship and denial of justice&para;<br>through delay if each issue must await the determination&para;<br>of all issues as to all parties before a final judgment can be&para;<br>had”). The Rule thus aimed to augment, not diminish,&para;<br>appeal opportunity.&para;<br>Section 1407 is of more recent vintage. Enacted in 1968&para;<br>in response to a growing number of complex but related&para;<br>cases filed in multiple districts, §1407 authorizes the&para;<br>Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) to transfer civil actions “involving one or more common questions&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Compare&para;<br>&para;<br>Rule 54(b), which lodges discretion to authorize appeals in&para;<br>district courts, with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f), which authorizes courts of appeals to permit an immediate appeal from a district&para;<br>court order granting or denying class-action certification.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>GELBOIM v.

The&para;<br>first three categories involved putative class actions, each&para;<br>with a single lead case: (1) the Gelboim-Zacher action,&para;<br>filed on behalf of purchasers of bonds with LIBOR-linked&para;<br>interest rates; (2) an action filed on behalf of purchasers of&para;<br>over-the-counter LIBOR-based instruments (OTC plaintiffs); (3) an action filed on behalf of purchasers of LIBORbased instruments on exchanges (Exchange plaintiffs).&para;<br>The fourth category, not relevant here, comprised a set of&para;<br>individual actions filed by Charles Schwab Corporation&para;<br>and related entities. The Gelboim-Zacher complaint asserted a federal antitrust claim under §1 of the Sherman&para;<br>Act, 15 U. S. C. §1, and that claim only, while the complaints in the other actions asserted a federal antitrust&para;<br>claim in addition to other differently based federal and&para;<br>state claims.&para;<br>Determining that no plaintiff could assert a cognizable&para;<br>antitrust injury, the District Court granted the banks’&para;<br>motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ antitrust claims—the sole&para;<br>claim raised in the Gelboim-Zacher complaint.

Consequently, they&para;<br>maintain, there is no appeal of right from an order dismissing fewer than all consolidated claims, thus the sole&para;<br>avenue for appeal while the consolidation continues is&para;<br>Rule 54(b).

In re Refrigerant Compressors Antitrust Litigation, 731&para;<br>F. 3d 586, 590–592 (CA6 2013). No merger occurs, however, when “the&para;<br>master complaint is not meant to be a pleading with legal effect but&para;<br>only an administrative summary of the claims brought by all the&para;<br>plaintiffs.” Id., at 590.&para;<br>4 We express no opinion on whether an order deciding one of multiple&para;<br>cases combined in an all-purpose consolidation qualifies under §1291 as&para;<br>a final decision appealable of right. See Brown v.

S. 737,&para;<br>742–743 (1976) (Rule 54(b) inapplicable where “complaint&para;<br>advanced a single legal theory which was applied to only&para;<br>one set of facts”). In short, Rule 54(b) is designed to permit acceleration of appeals in multiple-claim cases, not to&para;<br>retard appeals in single-claim cases.7&para;<br>Section 1292(b), the banks conceded at argument, see&para;<br>Tr. of Oral Arg. 40–41, is inapposite here. It allows district courts to designate for review interlocutory orders&para;<br>“not otherwise appealable,” where immediate appeal “may&para;<br>materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.” §1292(b). The designation may be accepted or&para;<br>rejected in the discretion of the court of appeals. Ibid. See&para;<br>generally Solimine, Revitalizing Interlocutory Appeals in&para;<br>the Federal Courts, 58 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1165 (1990);&para;<br>Note, Interlocutory Appeals in the Federal Courts Under&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §1292(b), 88 Harv. L. Rev. 607 (1975). It&para;<br>suffices to note that there is nothing “interlocutory” about&para;<br>the dismissal order in the Gelboim-Zacher action.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the&para;<br>U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit deeming the&para;<br>District Court’s dismissal of the Gelboim-Zacher complaint&para;<br>unripe for appellate review, and we remand the case for&para;<br>further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 We need not decide whether or how Rule 54(b) applies to cases consolidated for all purposes involving closely related issues, actions that&para;<br>could have been brought under the umbrella of one complaint. Cf.&para;<br>supra, at 7, n. 4. The Rule surely was not designed to apply to numerous actions that the MDL panel combines for efficient pretrial proceedings because they have in common “one or more questions of fact,” but&para;<br>otherwise vary in character.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
