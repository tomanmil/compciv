VICE, AS EXECUTRIX OF THE ESTATE OF VICE, &para;<br>&para;<br>ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–114.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 22, 2011—Decided June 6, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>Claiming that he was subjected to dirty tricks during his successful&para;<br>campaign to become the police chief of Vinton, La., petitioner Fox&para;<br>filed a state-court suit against Vice, the incumbent chief, and the&para;<br>town (Vice, for short). Fox’s suit asserted both state-law claims, in&para;<br>cluding defamation, and federal civil rights claims under 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1983, including interference with Fox’s right to seek public office.&para;<br>Vice removed the case to federal court based on the §1983 claims. Af&para;<br>ter discovery, he sought summary judgment on the federal claims,&para;<br>which Fox conceded were not valid. The District Court accordingly&para;<br>dismissed them with prejudice and remanded the remaining claims&para;<br>to state court, noting that Vice’s attorneys’ work could be useful in&para;<br>the state-court proceedings. Vice then asked the federal court for at&para;<br>torney’s fees under §1988, submitting attorney billing records esti&para;<br>mating the time spent on the entire suit, without differentiating be&para;<br>tween time spent on the now-dismissed federal claims and on the&para;<br>remaining state claims. The court granted the motion on the ground&para;<br>that Fox’s federal claims were frivolous, awarding Vice fees for all&para;<br>work his attorneys had performed in the suit. Although the state-law&para;<br>allegations had not been found frivolous, the court did not require&para;<br>Vice to separate out the work the attorneys had done on the two sets&para;<br>of claims. It also declined to reduce the fee award to reflect the sur&para;<br>viving state-law claims, noting that both sides had focused on the&para;<br>frivolous §1983 claims. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, rejecting Fox’s&para;<br>argument that every claim in a suit must be frivolous for the defen&para;<br>dant to recover any fees, and agreeing with the District Court that&para;<br>the litigation had focused on the frivolous federal claims.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FOX v. VICE&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. When a plaintiff’s suit involves both frivolous and non-frivolous&para;<br>claims, a court may grant reasonable fees to the defendant, but only&para;<br>for costs that the defendant would not have incurred but for the frivo&para;<br>lous claims. Pp. 5–11.&para;<br>(a) Section 1988 allows the award of “a reasonable attorney’s fee”&para;<br>to “the prevailing party” in certain civil rights cases, including §1983&para;<br>suits. While most of this Court’s §1988 decisions have concerned fees&para;<br>to prevailing plaintiffs, §1988 also authorizes a fee award to a pre&para;<br>vailing defendant “upon a finding that the plaintiff’s action was frivo&para;<br>lous, unreasonable, or without foundation.” Christiansburg Garment&para;<br>Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 421. Just as plaintiffs may receive fees&para;<br>under §1988 even if they are not victorious on every claim, Hensley v.&para;<br>Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 435, so too may a defendant be reimbursed&para;<br>for costs under §1988 even if the plaintiff’s suit is not wholly frivo&para;<br>lous, ibid., n. 10. The defendant is not entitled to fees arising from&para;<br>these non-frivolous charges, see Christiansburg, 434 U. S., at 420–&para;<br>421, but the presence of reasonable allegations does not immunize&para;<br>the plaintiff against paying for the fees that his frivolous claims im&para;<br>posed. Pp. 5–7.&para;<br>(b) The question then becomes how to allocate fees in a lawsuit&para;<br>having both frivolous and non-frivolous claims. Congress’s purpose&para;<br>in enacting §1988—to relieve defendants of the burdens associated&para;<br>with fending off frivolous litigation—points to the proper standard:&para;<br>Section 1988 allows a defendant to recover reasonable attorney’s fees&para;<br>incurred because of, but only because of, a frivolous claim; i.e., §1988&para;<br>permits the defendant to receive only the portion of his fees that he&para;<br>would not have paid but for the frivolous claim. A standard allowing&para;<br>more expansive fee-shifting would furnish windfalls to some defen&para;<br>dants, who would be relieved of normal litigation costs merely be&para;<br>cause the plaintiff’s suit also included frivolous claims. This “but-for”&para;<br>standard may, in some instances, allow compensation to a defendant&para;<br>for attorney work relating to both frivolous and non-frivolous claims,&para;<br>for instance, if the frivolous claim requires a lawyer to do more work&para;<br>because of the defendant’s greater financial exposure on that claim.&para;<br>The dispositive question is not whether attorney costs at all relate to&para;<br>a non-frivolous claim, but whether the costs would have been in&para;<br>curred in the absence of the frivolous allegation. The answers to&para;<br>those inquiries will usually track each other, but when they diverge,&para;<br>it is the second one that matters. The determination of fees “should&para;<br>not result in a second major litigation.” Hensley, 461 U. S., at 437.&para;<br>The essential goal in shifting fees is to do rough justice, not to&para;<br>achieve auditing perfection. The trial court has wide discretion, but&para;<br>must apply the correct but-for standard. And the appeals court must&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>determine whether the trial court asked and answered this but-for&para;<br>question, rather than some other. Pp. 7–11.&para;<br>2. The lower courts used an incorrect standard in awarding fees to&para;<br>Vice. The District Court’s analysis suggests that Vice’s attorneys&para;<br>would have done much the same work even if Fox had not brought&para;<br>his frivolous claims. The charges arose out of Vice’s conduct in the&para;<br>campaign, and with respect both to the frivolous federal claims and to&para;<br>the non-frivolous state-law claims, his “defense entailed proof or de&para;<br>nial of essentially the same facts.” It thus seems likely that Vice’s at&para;<br>torneys would have, e.g., taken many of the same depositions. Al&para;<br>though the District Court noted the usefulness of the attorneys’ work&para;<br>in defending against the state-law claims, it failed to take proper ac&para;<br>count of the overlap between the frivolous and non-frivolous claims.&para;<br>Its reasoning—that the close relationship between the federal and&para;<br>state-law claims supported the award—cannot be squared with the&para;<br>congressional policy of sparing defendants from the costs only of&para;<br>frivolous litigation. Nor did the Fifth Circuit uphold the award on&para;<br>the proper ground. It seemed to think Vice could receive fees for any&para;<br>work useful to defending against a frivolous claim, even if his lawyers&para;<br>would have done that work regardless. On this record, the case must&para;<br>be returned to the lower courts.

See 42 U. S. C. §1988. We have held that a defen&para;<br>dant may receive such an award if the plaintiff’s suit is&para;<br>frivolous. In this case, the plaintiff asserted both frivolous&para;<br>and non-frivolous claims. We hold today that a court may&para;<br>grant reasonable fees to the defendant in this circum&para;<br>stance, but only for costs that the defendant would not&para;<br>have incurred but for the frivolous claims. A trial court&para;<br>has wide discretion in applying this standard. But here&para;<br>we must vacate the judgment below because the court&para;<br>used a different and incorrect standard in awarding fees.&para;<br>I&para;<br>This case arises out of an election for chief of police in&para;<br>the town of Vinton, Louisiana. The candidates were peti&para;<br>tioner Ricky Fox (the challenger) and respondent Billy Ray&para;<br>Vice (the incumbent).1 By Fox’s account, Vice resorted to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Vice died during the course of this litigation.&para;<br>Pursuant to this&para;<br>Court’s Rule 35.1, we substituted the executor of his estate as respon&para;<br>dent. 562 U. S. ___ (2011). But for the sake of clarity, we refer to the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FOX v. VICE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>an assortment of dirty tricks to try to force Fox out of the&para;<br>race. In particular, Vice sent an anonymous letter to Fox&para;<br>threatening to publish damaging charges against him if he&para;<br>remained a candidate. Vice also arranged for a third party&para;<br>to publicly accuse Fox of using racial slurs and then to file&para;<br>a criminal complaint against Fox repeating those allega&para;<br>tions. And when prosecutors ignored that faux complaint,&para;<br>Vice leaked it to the press. Yet all of these machinations&para;<br>failed; Fox won the election. And Vice got an even greater&para;<br>comeuppance: He was subsequently convicted of criminal&para;<br>extortion for his election-related conduct.&para;<br>Fox, however, chose not to let the matter rest; he filed&para;<br>this suit in Louisiana state court against Vice and the&para;<br>town of Vinton, also a respondent here. Fox’s complaint&para;<br>asserted both state-law claims, including defamation, and&para;<br>federal civil rights claims under 42 U. S. C. §1983, includ&para;<br>ing interference with his right to seek public office. Vice&para;<br>and the town (Vice, for short) removed the case to federal&para;<br>court on the basis of the §1983 claims.&para;<br>At the end of discovery in the suit, Vice moved for sum&para;<br>mary judgment on Fox’s federal claims. Fox conceded that&para;<br>the claims were “no[t] valid,” App. 169, and the District&para;<br>Court accordingly dismissed them with prejudice. In the&para;<br>same ruling, the court declined to exercise supplemental&para;<br>jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims. Docket&para;<br>No. 2:06–cv–135 (WD La., Oct. 16, 2007), App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 38a–40a. The court instead remanded the now&para;<br>slimmed-down case to state court for adjudication. In&para;<br>doing so, the District Court observed that “[a]ny trial&para;<br>preparation, legal research, and discovery may be used by&para;<br>the parties in the state court proceedings.” Id., at 40a.&para;<br>Vice then asked the federal court for an award of attor&para;<br>ney’s fees under §1988, arguing that Fox’s federal claims&para;<br>were “baseless and without merit.” App. 198. Vice stated&para;<br>——————&para;<br>respondent as Vice.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that his lawyers had had to participate in five lengthy&para;<br>depositions and review numerous records to defend&para;<br>against Fox’s charges. Id., at 199. In support of his fee&para;<br>request, Vice submitted attorney billing records estimat&para;<br>ing the time spent on the whole suit, without differentiat&para;<br>ing between the federal and state-law claims. See Supp.&para;<br>App. 8–67.&para;<br>The District Court granted the motion for attorney’s fees&para;<br>on the ground that Fox’s federal claims were frivolous.&para;<br>Although the state-law allegations had not been found&para;<br>frivolous (and indeed remained live), the court did not&para;<br>require Vice to separate out the work his attorneys had&para;<br>done on the two sets of claims. Docket No. 2:06–cv–135&para;<br>(WD La., Sept. 22, 2008), App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. Ac&para;<br>cording to the court, such “segregation” was unnecessary&para;<br>because the “various claims arose out of the same transac&para;<br>tion and were so interrelated that their prosecution or&para;<br>defense entailed proof or denial of essentially the same&para;<br>facts.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Simi&para;<br>larly, the court declined to reduce the fee award to reflect&para;<br>the surviving state-law claims. “[T]hroughout the litiga&para;<br>tion,” the court stated, both sides “focus[ed]” on Fox’s&para;<br>frivolous §1983 claims. Id., at 32a–33a. The court there&para;<br>fore concluded that Vice should receive all of the fees he&para;<br>reasonably incurred in defending the suit—a total of&para;<br>$48,681. Id., at 34a.&para;<br>A divided Court of Appeals affirmed. 594 F. 3d 423&para;<br>(CA5 2010). The majority first rejected Fox’s contention&para;<br>that all claims in a suit must be frivolous for the defen&para;<br>dant to recover any fees. That rule, the court explained,&para;<br>would “ ‘allow plaintiffs to prosecute frivolous claims with&para;<br>out consequenc[e]’ ” so long as they added a single non&para;<br>frivolous claim. Id., at 428 (quoting Tutor-Saliba Corp. v.&para;<br>Hailey, 452 F. 3d 1055, 1064 (CA9 2006)). The Court of&para;<br>Appeals then turned to the District Court’s decision that&para;<br>Vice was entitled to fees for all time thus far spent on the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FOX v. VICE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>case, even though state-law claims remained unadjudi&para;<br>cated. Repeating the trial court’s view that the whole&para;<br>litigation had focused on the frivolous federal claims, the&para;<br>Fifth Circuit upheld the fee award. See 594 F. 3d, at 428.&para;<br>Judge Southwick dissented. He agreed that Vice was&para;<br>entitled to some reimbursement for fees. Id., at 430. But&para;<br>he thought the District Court had erred in declining to&para;<br>“allocate the fees separately between the successful claims&para;<br>and the unsuccessful” ones just because all of them were&para;<br>“interrelated.” Ibid. “[W]hen some claims are dismissed&para;<br>as frivolous and others are not,” he stated, the defendants&para;<br>should receive fees only for “the legal work allocable solely&para;<br>or dominantly to the dismissed” claims. Id., at 431. Be&para;<br>cause in this case “almost all of the defendant[s’] discovery&para;<br>and factual analysis would have been necessary even if no&para;<br>federal claims had been brought,” he concluded, the fee&para;<br>award should have been much smaller. Ibid.&para;<br>The Fifth Circuit’s decision deepened a Circuit split&para;<br>about whether and to what extent a court may award fees&para;<br>to a defendant under §1988 when a plaintiff asserts both&para;<br>frivolous and non-frivolous claims.2 One Court of Appeals&para;<br>has forbidden any compensation unless all of the plaintiff’s&para;<br>claims are frivolous. See Balmer v. HCA, Inc., 423 F. 3d&para;<br>606, 617 (CA6 2005). Others have rejected this approach,&para;<br>but struggled with how to allocate fees in a suit that in&para;<br>volves a mix of frivolous and non-frivolous claims. Com&para;<br>pare, e.g., 594 F. 3d 423 (CA5 2010) (opinion below), with&para;<br>Colombrito v. Kelly, 764 F. 2d 122, 132 (CA2 1985) (declin&para;<br>ing to award fees when the frivolous claim “added no&para;<br>additional testimony or expense to the trial”). We granted&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The parties do not dispute for purposes of argument here that this&para;<br>case involves both kinds of claims. The District Court deemed the&para;<br>federal claims frivolous, and Fox has not asked us to disturb that&para;<br>ruling. See Brief for Petitioner 26, and n. 2. The court remanded the&para;<br>state-law claims to state court, and Vice has assumed in this Court that&para;<br>they are not frivolous. See Brief for Respondents 8, n. 5.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>certiorari to resolve these questions. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Our legal system generally requires each party to bear&para;<br>his own litigation expenses, including attorney’s fees, re&para;<br>gardless whether he wins or loses. Indeed, this principle&para;<br>is so firmly entrenched that it is known as the “American&para;<br>Rule.” See Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness&para;<br>Society, 421 U. S. 240, 247 (1975). But Congress has&para;<br>authorized courts to deviate from this background rule in&para;<br>certain types of cases by shifting fees from one party to&para;<br>another. See Burlington v. Dague, 505 U. S. 557, 562&para;<br>(1992) (listing federal fee-shifting provisions).&para;<br>The statute involved here, 42 U. S. C. §1988, allows the&para;<br>award of “a reasonable attorney’s fee” to “the prevailing&para;<br>party” in various kinds of civil rights cases, including suits&para;<br>brought under §1983. Most of our decisions addressing&para;<br>this provision have concerned the grant of fees to prevail&para;<br>ing plaintiffs. When a plaintiff succeeds in remedying a&para;<br>civil rights violation, we have stated, he serves “as&para;<br>a ‘private attorney general,’ vindicating a policy that&para;<br>Congress considered of the highest priority.” Newman v.&para;<br>Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U. S. 400, 402 (1968)&para;<br>(per curiam). He therefore “should ordinarily recover an&para;<br>attorney’s fee” from the defendant—the party whose mis&para;<br>conduct created the need for legal action. Christiansburg&para;<br>Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 416 (1978) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). Fee shifting in such a case at&para;<br>once reimburses a plaintiff for “what it cos[t] [him] to&para;<br>vindicate [civil] rights,” Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U. S. 561,&para;<br>577–578 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted), and&para;<br>holds to account “a violator of federal law,” Christians&para;<br>burg, 434 U. S., at 418.&para;<br>In Christiansburg, we held that §1988 also authorizes a&para;<br>fee award to a prevailing defendant, but under a different&para;<br>standard reflecting the “quite different equitable consid&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>FOX v. VICE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>erations” at stake. Id., at 419. In enacting §1988, we&para;<br>stated, Congress sought “to protect defendants from bur&para;<br>densome litigation having no legal or factual basis.” Id.,&para;<br>at 420. Accordingly, §1988 authorizes a district court to&para;<br>award attorney’s fees to a defendant “upon a finding that&para;<br>the plaintiff’s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or with&para;<br>out foundation.” Id., at 421; see also Kentucky v. Graham,&para;<br>473 U. S. 159, 165, n. 9 (1985).&para;<br>These standards would be easy to apply if life were like&para;<br>the movies, but that is usually not the case. In Hollywood,&para;<br>litigation most often concludes with a dramatic verdict&para;<br>that leaves one party fully triumphant and the other&para;<br>utterly prostrate. The court in such a case would know&para;<br>exactly how to award fees (even if that anti-climactic scene&para;<br>is generally left on the cutting-room floor). But in the real&para;<br>world, litigation is more complex, involving multiple&para;<br>claims for relief that implicate a mix of legal theories and&para;<br>have different merits. Some claims succeed; others fail.&para;<br>Some charges are frivolous; others (even if not ultimately&para;<br>successful) have a reasonable basis. In short, litigation is&para;<br>messy, and courts must deal with this untidiness in&para;<br>awarding fees.&para;<br>Given this reality, we have made clear that plaintiffs&para;<br>may receive fees under §1988 even if they are not victori&para;<br>ous on every claim. A civil rights plaintiff who obtains&para;<br>meaningful relief has corrected a violation of federal law&para;<br>and, in so doing, has vindicated Congress’s statutory pur&para;<br>poses. That “result is what matters,” we explained in&para;<br>Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 435 (1983): A court&para;<br>should compensate the plaintiff for the time his attorney&para;<br>reasonably spent in achieving the favorable outcome, even&para;<br>if “the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention.” Ibid.&para;<br>The fee award, of course, should not reimburse the plain&para;<br>tiff for work performed on claims that bore no relation to&para;<br>the grant of relief: Such work “cannot be deemed to have&para;<br>been expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). But the pres&para;<br>ence of these unsuccessful claims does not immunize a&para;<br>defendant against paying for the attorney’s fees that the&para;<br>plaintiff reasonably incurred in remedying a breach of his&para;<br>civil rights.&para;<br>Analogous principles indicate that a defendant may&para;<br>deserve fees even if not all the plaintiff’s claims were&para;<br>frivolous. In this context, §1988 serves to relieve a defen&para;<br>dant of expenses attributable to frivolous charges. The&para;<br>plaintiff acted wrongly in leveling such allegations, and&para;<br>the court may shift to him the reasonable costs that those&para;<br>claims imposed on his adversary. See Christiansburg, 434&para;<br>U. S., at 420–421. That remains true when the plaintiff’s&para;<br>suit also includes non-frivolous claims. The defendant, of&para;<br>course, is not entitled to any fees arising from these non&para;<br>frivolous charges. See ibid. But the presence of reason&para;<br>able allegations in a suit does not immunize the plaintiff&para;<br>against paying for the fees that his frivolous claims&para;<br>imposed.&para;<br>Indeed, we have previously said exactly this much. In&para;<br>Hensley, we noted the possibility that a plaintiff might&para;<br>prevail on one contention in a suit while also asserting an&para;<br>unrelated frivolous claim. In this situation, we explained,&para;<br>a court could properly award fees to both parties—to the&para;<br>plaintiff, to reflect the fees he incurred in bringing the&para;<br>meritorious claim; and to the defendant, to compensate for&para;<br>the fees he paid in defending against the frivolous one.&para;<br>See 461 U. S., at 435, n. 10. We thus made clear that a&para;<br>court may reimburse a defendant for costs under §1988&para;<br>even if a plaintiff’s suit is not wholly frivolous. Fee&para;<br>shifting to recompense a defendant (as to recompense a&para;<br>plaintiff) is not all-or-nothing: A defendant need not show&para;<br>that every claim in a complaint is frivolous to qualify for&para;<br>fees.&para;<br>The question then becomes one of allocation: In a law&para;<br>suit involving a mix of frivolous and non-frivolous claims,&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FOX v. VICE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>what work may the defendant receive fees for? Vice con&para;<br>cedes, as he must, that a defendant may not obtain com&para;<br>pensation for work unrelated to a frivolous claim. Brief&para;<br>for Respondents 42, n. 13. Similarly, we think Fox would&para;<br>have to concede (once he has lost the argument that the&para;<br>presence of any non-frivolous claim precludes a fee award)&para;<br>that the defendant may receive reasonable fees for work&para;<br>related exclusively to a frivolous claim. The question in&para;<br>dispute concerns work that helps defend against non&para;<br>frivolous and frivolous claims alike—for example, a depo&para;<br>sition eliciting facts relevant to both allegations.&para;<br>Vice proposes authorizing the trial court to award fees&para;<br>for work that is “fairly attributable” to the frivolous por&para;<br>tion of the lawsuit. See, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, 45. But&para;<br>that standard is in truth no standard at all. The very&para;<br>question under consideration is: What fees may be fairly&para;<br>attributed to frivolous claims under §1988? To answer&para;<br>“Those that are fairly attributable to frivolous claims” is&para;<br>just to restate this question. And that non-response re&para;<br>sponse would leave to each and every trial court not only&para;<br>the implementation, but also the invention, of the applica&para;<br>ble legal standard. We do not think trial courts would&para;<br>appreciate that lack of guidance. And yet more important,&para;<br>we do not think such an empty and amorphous test would&para;<br>ensure that all fee awards to defendants comport with&para;<br>Congress’s purpose in enacting §1988.&para;<br>That congressional policy points to a different and more&para;<br>meaningful standard: Section 1988 allows a defendant to&para;<br>recover reasonable attorney’s fees incurred because of, but&para;<br>only because of, a frivolous claim. Or what is the same&para;<br>thing stated as a but-for test: Section 1988 permits the&para;<br>defendant to receive only the portion of his fees that he&para;<br>would not have paid but for the frivolous claim. Recall&para;<br>that the relevant purpose of §1988 is to relieve defendants&para;<br>of the burdens associated with fending off frivolous litiga&para;<br>tion. See supra, at 5–6.

But if the defen&para;<br>dant would have incurred those fees anyway, to defend&para;<br>against non-frivolous claims, then a court has no basis&para;<br>for transferring the expense to the plaintiff. Suppose, for&para;<br>example, that a defendant’s attorney conducts a deposition&para;<br>on matters relevant to both a frivolous and a non-frivolous&para;<br>claim—and more, that the lawyer would have taken and&para;<br>committed the same time to this deposition even if the&para;<br>case had involved only the non-frivolous allegation. In&para;<br>that circumstance, the work does not implicate Congress’s&para;<br>reason for allowing defendants to collect fees. The defen&para;<br>dant would have incurred the expense in any event; he has&para;<br>suffered no incremental harm from the frivolous claim. In&para;<br>short, the defendant has never shouldered the burden that&para;<br>Congress, in enacting §1988, wanted to relieve. The basic&para;<br>American Rule thus continues to operate.3&para;<br>A standard allowing more expansive fee-shifting would&para;<br>furnish windfalls to some defendants, making them better&para;<br>off because they were subject to a suit including frivolous&para;<br>claims. For under any more permissive test, the simple&para;<br>presence of a frivolous claim would allow the court to shift&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The test set out here differs from the one we adopted in Hensley v.&para;<br>Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 435 (1983), to govern fee awards to plaintiffs&para;<br>in cases involving both successful and unsuccessful claims. See supra,&para;<br>at 6–7. That difference reflects the disparate legislative purposes we&para;<br>have recognized in the two settings. See Christiansburg Garment Co. v.&para;<br>EEOC, 434 U. S. 412, 419–420 (1978); supra, at 5–6. Congress author&para;<br>ized fees to plaintiffs to compensate them for the costs of redressing&para;<br>civil rights violations; accordingly, a plaintiff may receive fees for all&para;<br>work relating to the accomplishment of that result, even if “the plaintiff&para;<br>failed to prevail on every contention raised.” Hensley, 461 U. S., at 435.&para;<br>By contrast, Congress authorized fees to defendants to remove the&para;<br>burden associated with fending off frivolous claims; accordingly, a&para;<br>defendant may recover for fees that those claims caused him to incur.&para;<br>In each context, the standard for allocating fees in “mixed” cases&para;<br>matches the relevant congressional purpose.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>FOX v. VICE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to the plaintiff some of the costs of defending against&para;<br>regular, non-frivolous charges. So two defendants (call&para;<br>them Vice and Rice) could face identical non-frivolous&para;<br>allegations, but because Vice also confronted a frivolous&para;<br>claim, he might end by paying less than Rice to his attor&para;<br>neys. The chance assertion—for Vice, the downright lucky&para;<br>assertion—of the frivolous claim could relieve him not only&para;<br>of the incremental costs of that claim but also of costs that&para;<br>he, like Rice, would have had to pay in its absence. Sec&para;<br>tion 1988 provides no warrant for that peculiar result;&para;<br>that statute was “never intended to produce windfalls” for&para;<br>parties. See Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S. 103, 115 (1992)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>At the same time, the “but-for” standard we require may&para;<br>in some cases allow compensation to a defendant for at&para;<br>torney work relating to both frivolous and non-frivolous&para;<br>claims. Suppose, for example, that a plaintiff asserts one&para;<br>frivolous and one non-frivolous claim, but that only the&para;<br>frivolous allegation can legally result in a damages award.&para;<br>If an attorney performs work useful to defending against&para;<br>both, but did so only because of the defendant’s monetary&para;<br>exposure on the frivolous charge, a court may decide to&para;<br>shift fees. Or similarly, imagine that the frivolous claim&para;<br>enables removal of the case to federal court, which in&para;<br>turn drives up litigation expenses. Here too, our standard&para;<br>would permit awarding fees for work relevant to both&para;<br>claims in order to reflect the increased costs (if any) of the&para;<br>federal forum. And frivolous claims may increase the cost&para;<br>of defending a suit in ways that are not reflected in the&para;<br>number of hours billed. If a defendant could prove, for&para;<br>example, that a frivolous claim involved a specialized area&para;<br>that reasonably caused him to hire more expensive coun&para;<br>sel for the entire case, then the court may reimburse the&para;<br>defendant for the increased marginal cost. As all these&para;<br>examples show, the dispositive question is not whether&para;<br>attorney costs at all relate to a non-frivolous claim, but&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>whether the costs would have been incurred in the ab&para;<br>sence of the frivolous allegation. The answers to those&para;<br>inquiries will usually track each other, but when they&para;<br>diverge, it is the second that matters.&para;<br>We emphasize, as we have before, that the determina&para;<br>tion of fees “should not result in a second major litigation.”&para;<br>Hensley, 461 U. S., at 437. The fee applicant (whether a&para;<br>plaintiff or a defendant) must, of course, submit appropri&para;<br>ate documentation to meet “the burden of establishing&para;<br>entitlement to an award.” Ibid. But trial courts need not,&para;<br>and indeed should not, become green-eyeshade account&para;<br>ants. The essential goal in shifting fees (to either party) is&para;<br>to do rough justice, not to achieve auditing perfection. So&para;<br>trial courts may take into account their overall sense of a&para;<br>suit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating&para;<br>an attorney’s time. And appellate courts must give sub&para;<br>stantial deference to these determinations, in light of “the&para;<br>district court’s superior understanding of the litigation.”&para;<br>Ibid.; see Webb v. Dyer County Bd. of Ed., 471 U. S. 234,&para;<br>244 (1985). We can hardly think of a sphere of judicial&para;<br>decisionmaking in which appellate micromanagement has&para;<br>less to recommend it.&para;<br>But the trial court must apply the correct standard, and&para;<br>the appeals court must make sure that has occurred. See&para;<br>Perdue v. Kenny A., 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at&para;<br>14) (“Determining a ‘reasonable attorney’s fee’ is a matter&para;<br>that is committed to the sound discretion of a trial judge,&para;<br>. . . but the judge’s discretion is not unlimited”); Cf. Koon&para;<br>v. United States, 518 U. S. 81, 100 (1996) (“A district court&para;<br>by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error&para;<br>of law”). That means the trial court must determine&para;<br>whether the fees requested would not have accrued but for&para;<br>the frivolous claim. And the appeals court must determine&para;<br>whether the trial court asked and answered that question,&para;<br>rather than some other. A trial court has wide discretion&para;<br>when, but only when, it calls the game by the right rules.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>FOX v. VICE &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>The task remains of applying these principles to the fee&para;<br>award Vice received. The District Court’s analysis sug&para;<br>gests that Vice’s attorneys would have done much the&para;<br>same work even if Fox had not brought his frivolous&para;<br>claims. As noted earlier, see supra, at 3, the court ac&para;<br>knowledged that Fox’s federal and state-law claims were&para;<br>“interrelated,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a (internal quota&para;<br>tion marks omitted). The charges “arose out of the same&para;<br>transaction”—Vice’s conduct in the campaign—and their&para;<br>“defense entailed proof or denial of essentially the same&para;<br>facts.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). It there&para;<br>fore seems likely that Vice’s attorneys would at least have&para;<br>conducted similar fact-gathering activities—taken many of&para;<br>the same depositions, produced and reviewed many of the&para;<br>same documents, and so forth. Indeed, the District Court&para;<br>highlighted the usefulness of the attorneys’ work to de&para;<br>fending against the state-law claims: In its order remand&para;<br>ing those claims, the court noted that the “trial prepara&para;<br>tion, legal research, and discovery” done in the federal&para;<br>court could “be used by the parties in the state court pro&para;<br>ceedings.” Id., at 40a.&para;<br>The District Court’s decision to award full attorney’s&para;<br>fees to Vice failed to take proper account of this overlap&para;<br>between the frivolous and non-frivolous claims. Rather&para;<br>than apply the but-for standard we have set out, the court&para;<br>indicated that the paramount factor was the parties’ “fo&para;<br>cus” in the litigation. Id., at 33a. The court did not ad&para;<br>dress whether the “interrelated[ness]” of the claims meant&para;<br>that Vice would have incurred part or most of his fees even&para;<br>if Fox had asserted only the non-frivolous state-law&para;<br>claims. To the contrary, the court suggested that the close&para;<br>relationship between the federal and state-law claims&para;<br>supported Vice’s request to recover all of his attorney’s&para;<br>fees. See id., at 28a; supra, at 3. That reasoning stands&para;<br>the appropriate analysis on its head. It cannot be squared&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>with the congressional policy of sparing defendants from&para;<br>the costs of frivolous litigation.&para;<br>Nor did the Court of Appeals uphold the award of fees&para;<br>on the ground that we would require. The majority articu&para;<br>lated a standard that, taken alone, might be read as con&para;<br>sistent with our opinion; according to the court, a defen&para;<br>dant should receive fees for “work which can be distinctly&para;<br>traced to a plaintiff’s frivolous claims.” 594 F. 3d, at 429.&para;<br>But the court seemed to think that its test permitted&para;<br>awarding Vice fees for any work useful to defending&para;<br>against a frivolous claim, even if lawyers would have done&para;<br>that work regardless. Indeed, this very point divided the&para;<br>majority and the dissent. Judge Southwick objected to the&para;<br>fee award on the ground that “almost all [of] the defen&para;<br>dant[s’] discovery and factual analysis would have been&para;<br>necessary even if no federal claims had been brought.” Id.,&para;<br>at 431. But the majority never responded to that argu&para;<br>ment or otherwise engaged this crucial question. The&para;<br>majority instead merely reiterated the District Court’s&para;<br>reasoning that the parties had principally “focus[ed]” on&para;<br>the §1983 allegations. That finding, as we have explained,&para;<br>is irrelevant if Vice’s attorneys would have performed the&para;<br>same work to defend against the state-law claims.&para;<br>On this record, we must return the case to the lower&para;<br>courts. See, e.g., Perdue, 559 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at&para;<br>12–15); Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens’ Council&para;<br>for Clean Air, 478 U. S. 546, 566–568 (1986); Hensley, 461&para;<br>U. S., at 438–440. In a suit of this kind, involving both&para;<br>frivolous and non-frivolous claims, a defendant may re&para;<br>cover the reasonable attorney’s fees he expended solely&para;<br>because of the frivolous allegations. And that is all. Con&para;<br>sistent with the policy underlying §1988, the defendant&para;<br>may not receive compensation for any fees that he would&para;<br>have paid in the absence of the frivolous claims. We there&para;<br>fore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and&para;<br>remand the case for further proceedings consistent with&para;<br>this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
