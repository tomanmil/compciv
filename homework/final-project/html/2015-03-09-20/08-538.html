REILLY&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–538.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued November 3, 2009—Decided June 17, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent Reilly filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy when her catering&para;<br>business failed. She supported her petition with, inter alia, Schedule&para;<br>B, on which debtors must list their assets, and Schedule C, on which&para;<br>they must list the property they wish to reclaim as exempt. Her&para;<br>Schedule B assets included cooking and other kitchen equipment, to&para;<br>which she assigned an estimated market value of $10,718. On&para;<br>Schedule C, she claimed two exempt interests in this “business&para;<br>equipment”: a “tool[s] of the trade” exemption for the statutory&para;<br>maximum “$1,850 in value,” 11 U. S. C. §522(d)(6); and $8,868 under&para;<br>the statutory provisions allowing miscellaneous, or “wildcard,” ex&para;<br>emptions up to $10,225 in value. The claimed exemptions’ total value&para;<br>($10,718) equaled Reilly’s estimate of the equipment’s market value.&para;<br>Property claimed as exempt will be excluded from the bankruptcy es&para;<br>tate “[u]nless a party in interest” objects, §522(l), within a certain 30&para;<br>day period, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4003(b). Absent an objection,&para;<br>the property will be excluded from the estate even if the exemption’s&para;<br>value exceeds what the Code permits. See, e.g., §522(l); Taylor v.&para;<br>Freeland &amp; Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 642–643.&para;<br>Although an appraisal revealed that the equipment’s total market&para;<br>value could be as much as $17,200, petitioner Schwab, the bank&para;<br>ruptcy estate’s trustee, did not object to the claimed exemptions be&para;<br>cause the dollar value Reilly assigned to each fell within the limits of&para;<br>§§522(d)(5) and (6). Schwab moved the Bankruptcy Court for per&para;<br>mission to auction the equipment so Reilly could receive the $10,718&para;<br>she claimed exempt and the estate could distribute the remaining&para;<br>value to her creditors. Reilly countered that by equating on Schedule&para;<br>C the total value of her claimed exemptions in the equipment with&para;<br>the equipment’s estimated market value, she had put Schwab and&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHWAB v. REILLY&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>her creditors on notice that she intended to exempt the equipment’s&para;<br>full value, even if it turned out to be more than the amounts she de&para;<br>clared and that the Code allowed. She asserted that the estate had&para;<br>forfeited its claim to any portion of that value because Schwab had&para;<br>not objected within the Rule 4003(b) period, and that she would dis&para;<br>miss her petition rather than sell her equipment.&para;<br>The Bankruptcy Court denied Schwab’s motion and Reilly’s condi&para;<br>tional motion to dismiss. The District Court denied Schwab relief, re&para;<br>jecting his argument that neither the Code nor Rule 4003(b) requires&para;<br>a trustee to object to a claimed exemption where the amount the&para;<br>debtor declares as the exemption’s value is within the limits the Code&para;<br>prescribes. Affirming, the Third Circuit agreed that Reilly’s Schedule&para;<br>C entries indicated her intent to exempt the equipment’s full value.&para;<br>Relying on Taylor, it held that Schwab’s failure to object entitled&para;<br>Reilly to exempt the full value of her equipment, even though that&para;<br>value exceeded the amounts that Reilly declared and the Code per&para;<br>mitted.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Because Reilly gave “the value of [her] claimed exemption[s]” on&para;<br>Schedule C dollar amounts within the range the Code allows for what&para;<br>it defines as the “property claimed as exempt,” Schwab was not re&para;<br>quired to object to the exemptions in order to preserve the estate’s&para;<br>right to retain any value in the equipment beyond the value of the&para;<br>exempt interest. Pp. 6–23.&para;<br>(a) Reilly’s complicated view of the trustee’s statutory obligation,&para;<br>and her reading of Schedule C, does not accord with the Code. Pp. 6–&para;<br>15.&para;<br>(1) The parties agree that this case is governed by §522(l), which&para;<br>states that a Chapter 7 debtor must “file a list of property that the&para;<br>debtor claims as exempt under subsection (b) of this section,” and&para;<br>that “[u]nless a party in interest objects, the property claimed as ex&para;<br>empt on such list is exempt.” Reilly asserts that the “property&para;<br>claimed as exempt” refers to all of the information on Schedule C, in&para;<br>cluding the estimated market value of each asset. Schwab and&para;<br>amicus United States counter that because the Code defines such&para;<br>property as an interest, not to exceed a certain dollar amount, in a&para;<br>particular asset, not as the asset itself, the value of the property&para;<br>claimed exempt should be judged on the dollar value the debtor as&para;<br>signs the interest, not on the value the debtor assigns the asset.&para;<br>Pp. 6–9.&para;<br>(2) Schwab and the United States are correct. The portion of&para;<br>§522(l) that resolves this case is not, as Reilly asserts, the provision&para;<br>stating that the “property claimed as exempt on [Schedule C] is ex&para;<br>empt” unless an interested party objects. Rather, it is the portion&para;<br>that defines the objection’s target, namely, the “list of property that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>the debtor claims as exempt under subsection (b).” Section 522(b)&para;<br>does not define the “property claimed as exempt” by reference to the&para;<br>estimated market value. It refers only to property defined in §522(d),&para;<br>which in turn lists 12 categories of property that a debtor may claim&para;<br>as exempt. Most of these categories and all the ones applicable here&para;<br>define “property” as the debtor’s “interest”—up to a specified dollar&para;<br>amount—in the assets described in the category, not as the assets&para;<br>themselves. Schwab had no duty to object to the property Reilly&para;<br>claimed as exempt because its stated value was within the limits the&para;<br>Code allows. Reilly’s contrary view does not withstand scrutiny be&para;<br>cause it defines the target of a trustee’s objection based on Schedule&para;<br>C’s language and dictionary definitions of “property” at odds with the&para;<br>Code’s definition. The Third Circuit failed to account for the Code’s&para;<br>definition and for provisions that permit debtors to exempt certain&para;<br>property in kind or in full regardless of value. See, e.g., §522(d)(9).&para;<br>Schwab was entitled to evaluate the claimed exemptions’ propriety&para;<br>based on three Schedule C entries: the description of the business&para;<br>equipment in which Reilly claimed the exempt interests; the Code&para;<br>provisions governing the claimed exemptions; and the amounts Reilly&para;<br>listed in the column titled “value of claimed exemption.” This conclu&para;<br>sion does not render Reilly’s market value estimate superfluous. It&para;<br>simply confines that estimate to its proper role: aiding the trustee in&para;<br>administering the estate by helping him identify assets that may&para;<br>have value beyond the amount the debtor claims as exempt, or whose&para;<br>full value may not be available for exemption. This interpretation is&para;<br>consistent with the historical treatment of bankruptcy exemptions.&para;<br>Pp. 9–15.&para;<br>(b) Taylor does not dictate a contrary conclusion. While both Tay&para;<br>lor and this case concern the consequences of a trustee’s failure to ob&para;<br>ject to a claimed exemption within Rule 4003’s time period, Taylor es&para;<br>tablishes and applies the straightforward proposition that an&para;<br>interested party must object to a claimed exemption if the amount&para;<br>the debtor lists as the “value claimed exempt” is not within statutory&para;<br>limits. In Taylor, the value listed in Schedule C (“$ unknown”) was&para;<br>not plainly within those limits, but here, the values ($8,868 and&para;<br>$1,850) are within Code limits and thus do not raise the warning flag&para;<br>present in Taylor. Departing from Taylor would not only ignore the&para;<br>presumption that parties act lawfully and with knowledge of the law;&para;<br>it would also require the Court to expand the statutory definition of&para;<br>“property claimed as exempt” and the universe of information an in&para;<br>terested party must consider in evaluating an exemption’s validity.&para;<br>Even if the Code allowed such expansions, they would be ill advised.&para;<br>Basing the definition of “property claimed exempt,” and thus an in&para;<br>terested party’s obligation to object under §522(l), on inferences that&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHWAB v. REILLY&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>party must draw from preprinted bankruptcy schedules that evolve&para;<br>over time, rather than on the facial validity of the value the debtor&para;<br>assigns the “property claimed as exempt” as defined by the Code,&para;<br>would undermine the predictability the statute is designed to pro&para;<br>vide. Pp. 16–18.&para;<br>(c) Reilly’s argument threatens to convert the Code’s goal of giving&para;<br>debtors a fresh start into a free pass. By permitting a debtor “to&para;<br>withdraw from the estate certain interests in property, . . . up to cer&para;<br>tain values,” Rousey v. Jacoway, 544 U. S. 320, 325, Congress bal&para;<br>anced the difficult choices that exemption limits impose on debtors&para;<br>with the economic harm that exemptions visit on creditors. This&para;<br>Court should not alter that balance by requiring trustees to object to&para;<br>claimed exemptions based on form entries beyond those governing an&para;<br>exemption’s validity under the Code. In rejecting Reilly’s approach,&para;<br>the Court does not create incentives for trustees and creditors to&para;<br>sleep on their rights. The decision reached here encourages a debtor&para;<br>wishing to exempt an asset’s full market value or the asset itself to&para;<br>declare the value of the claimed exemption in a way that makes its&para;<br>scope clear. Such declarations will encourage the trustee to object&para;<br>promptly and preserve for the estate any value in the asset beyond&para;<br>relevant statutory limits. If the trustee fails to object, or his objection&para;<br>is overruled, the debtor will be entitled to exclude the asset’s full&para;<br>value. If the objection is sustained, the debtor will be required either&para;<br>to forfeit the portion of the exemption exceeding the statutory allow&para;<br>ance or to revise other exemptions or arrangements with creditors to&para;<br>permit the exemption. See Rule 1009(a). Either result will facilitate&para;<br>the expeditious and final disposition of assets, and thus enable the&para;<br>debtor and creditors to achieve a fresh start free of Reilly’s finality&para;<br>and clouded-title concerns.

The Bank­&para;<br>ruptcy Code specifies the types of property debtors may&para;<br>exempt, §522(b), as well as the maximum value of the&para;<br>exemptions a debtor may claim in certain assets, §522(d).&para;<br>Property a debtor claims as exempt will be excluded from&para;<br>the bankruptcy estate “[u]nless a party in interest” ob­&para;<br>jects. §522(l).&para;<br>This case presents an opportunity for us to resolve a&para;<br>disagreement among the Courts of Appeals about what&para;<br>constitutes a claim of exemption to which an interested&para;<br>party must object under §522(l). The issue is whether an&para;<br>interested party must object to a claimed exemption&para;<br>where, as here, the Code defines the property the debtor is&para;<br>authorized to exempt as an interest, the value of which&para;<br>may not exceed a certain dollar amount, in a particular&para;<br>type of asset, and the debtor’s schedule of exempt property&para;<br>accurately describes the asset and declares the “value of&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHWAB v.

Official Form 6, Schedule C (1991) (hereinaf­&para;<br>ter Schedule C). We hold that, in cases such as this, an&para;<br>interested party need not object to an exemption claimed&para;<br>in this manner in order to preserve the estate’s ability to&para;<br>recover value in the asset beyond the dollar value the&para;<br>debtor expressly declared exempt.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Respondent Nadejda Reilly filed for Chapter 7 bank­&para;<br>ruptcy when her catering business failed. She supported&para;<br>her petition with various schedules and statements, two of&para;<br>which are relevant here: Schedule B, on which the Bank­&para;<br>ruptcy Rules require debtors to list their assets (most of&para;<br>which become property of the estate), and Schedule C, on&para;<br>which the Rules require debtors to list the property they&para;<br>wish to reclaim as exempt. The assets Reilly listed on&para;<br>Schedule B included an itemized list of cooking and other&para;<br>kitchen equipment that she described as “business equip­&para;<br>ment,” and to which she assigned an estimated market&para;<br>value of $10,718. App. 40a, 49a–55a.&para;<br>On Schedule C, Reilly claimed two exempt interests in&para;<br>this equipment pursuant to different sections of the Code.&para;<br>Reilly claimed a “tool[s] of the trade” exemption of $1,850&para;<br>in the equipment under §522(d)(6), which permits a debtor&para;<br>to exempt his “aggregate interest, not to exceed $1,850 in&para;<br>value, in any implements, professional books, or tools, of&para;<br>[his] trade.” See also 69 Fed. Reg. 8482 (2004) (Table).&para;<br>And she claimed a miscellaneous exemption of $8,868 in&para;<br>the equipment under §522(d)(5), which, at the time she&para;<br>filed for bankruptcy, permitted a debtor to take a “wild­&para;<br>card” exemption equal to the “debtor’s aggregate interest&para;<br>in any property, not to exceed” $10,225 “in value.”1 See&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>1994 version of 11 U.

The total value of these claimed exemptions&para;<br>($10,718) equaled the value Reilly separately listed on&para;<br>Schedules B and C as the equipment’s estimated market&para;<br>value, see id., at 49a, 58a.&para;<br>Subject to exceptions not relevant here, the Federal&para;<br>Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure require interested parties&para;<br>to object to a debtor’s claimed exemptions within 30 days&para;<br>after the conclusion of the creditors’ meeting held pursu­&para;<br>ant to Rule 2003(a). See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy.

See, e.g., §522(l); Taylor v. Free&para;<br>land &amp; Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 642–643 (1992).&para;<br>Petitioner William G. Schwab, the trustee of Reilly’s&para;<br>bankruptcy estate, did not object to Reilly’s claimed ex­&para;<br>emptions in her business equipment because the dollar&para;<br>value Reilly assigned each exemption fell within the limits&para;<br>that §§522(d)(5) and (6) prescribe. App. 163a. But be­&para;<br>cause an appraisal revealed that the total market value of&para;<br>Reilly’s business equipment could be as much as $17,200,2&para;<br>Schwab moved the Bankruptcy Court for permission to&para;<br>auction the equipment so Reilly could receive the $10,718&para;<br>she claimed as exempt, and the estate could distribute the&para;<br>equipment’s remaining value (approximately $6,500) to&para;<br>Reilly’s creditors.

See 69 Fed. Reg. 8482&para;<br>(Table). In 2007 and 2010 the limits were again increased. See 72 id.,&para;<br>at 7082 (Table); 75 id., at 8748 (Table).&para;<br>2 Schwab concedes that the appraisal occurred before Rule 4003(b)’s&para;<br>30-day window for objecting to the claimed exemptions had passed. See&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 15.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHWAB v. REILLY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Reilly opposed Schwab’s motion. She argued that by&para;<br>equating on Schedule C the total value of the exemptions&para;<br>she claimed in the equipment with the equipment’s esti­&para;<br>mated market value, she had put Schwab and her credi­&para;<br>tors on notice that she intended to exempt the equipment’s&para;<br>full value, even if that amount turned out to be more than&para;<br>the dollar amount she declared, and more than the Code&para;<br>allowed. Id., at 165a. Citing §522(l), Reilly asserted that&para;<br>because her Schedule C notified Schwab of her intent to&para;<br>exempt the full value of her business equipment, he was&para;<br>obliged to object if he wished to preserve the estate’s right&para;<br>to retain any value in the equipment in excess of the&para;<br>$10,718 she estimated. Because Schwab did not object&para;<br>within the time prescribed by Rule 4003(b), Reilly asserted&para;<br>that the estate forfeited its claim to such value. Id., at&para;<br>165a. Reilly further informed the Bankruptcy Court that&para;<br>exempting her business equipment from the estate was so&para;<br>important to her that she would dismiss her bankruptcy&para;<br>case if doing so was the only way to avoid the equipment’s&para;<br>sale at auction.3&para;<br>The Bankruptcy Court denied both Schwab’s motion to&para;<br>auction the equipment and Reilly’s conditional motion to&para;<br>dismiss her case. See In re Reilly, 403 B. R. 336 (Bkrtcy.&para;<br>Ct. MD Pa. 2006). Schwab sought relief from the District&para;<br>Court, arguing that neither the Code nor Rule 4003(b)&para;<br>requires a trustee to object to a claimed exemption where&para;<br>the amount the debtor declares as the “value of [the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Reilly’s desire to avoid the equipment’s auction is understandable&para;<br>because the equipment, which Reilly’s parents purchased for her&para;<br>despite their own financial difficulties, has “ ‘extraordinary sentimental&para;<br>value.’ ” Brief for Respondent 5 (quoting App. 152a–153a). But the&para;<br>sentimental value of the property cannot drive our decision in this case,&para;<br>because sentimental value is not a basis for construing the Bankruptcy&para;<br>Code. Because the Code imposes limits on exemptions, many debtors&para;<br>who seek to take advantage of the Code are, no doubt, put to the&para;<br>similarly difficult choice of parting with property of “extraordinary&para;<br>sentimental value.” Id., at 152a−153a; see infra, at 19–23.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

The Dis­&para;<br>trict Court rejected Schwab’s argument, and the Court of&para;<br>Appeals affirmed. See In re Reilly, 534 F. 3d 173 (CA3&para;<br>2008).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals agreed with the Bankruptcy Court&para;<br>that by equating on Schedule C the total value of her&para;<br>exemptions in her business equipment with the equip­&para;<br>ment’s market value, Reilly “indicate[d] the intent” to&para;<br>exempt the equipment’s full value. Id., at 174. In reach­&para;<br>ing this conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on our&para;<br>decision in Taylor:&para;<br>“[W]e believe this case to be controlled by Taylor.&para;<br>Just as we perceive it was important to the Taylor&para;<br>Court that the debtor meant to exempt the full&para;<br>amount of the property by listing ‘unknown’ as both&para;<br>the value of the property and the value of the exemp­&para;<br>tion, it is important to us that Reilly valued the busi­&para;<br>ness equipment at $10,718 and claimed an exemption&para;<br>in the same amount. Such an identical listing put&para;<br>Schwab on notice that Reilly intended to exempt the&para;<br>property fully.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>.&para;<br>“ ‘[A]n unstated premise’ of Taylor was ‘that a debtor&para;<br>who exempts the entire reported value of an asset is&para;<br>claiming the “full amount,” whatever it turns out to&para;<br>be.’ ” 534 F. 3d, at 178−179.&para;<br>Relying on this “unstated premise,” the Court of Appeals&para;<br>held that Schwab’s failure to object to Reilly’s claimed&para;<br>exemptions entitled Reilly to the equivalent of an in-kind&para;<br>interest in her business equipment, even though the value&para;<br>of that exemption exceeded the amount that Reilly de­&para;<br>clared on Schedule C and the amount that the Code al­&para;<br>lowed her to withdraw from the bankruptcy estate. Ibid.&para;<br>As noted, the Court of Appeals’ decision adds to dis­&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHWAB v. REILLY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>agreement among the Circuits about what constitutes a&para;<br>claim of exemption to which an interested party must&para;<br>object under §522(l).4 We granted certiorari to resolve this&para;<br>conflict. See 556 U. S. ___ (2009). We conclude that the&para;<br>Court of Appeals’ approach fails to account for the text of&para;<br>the relevant Code provisions and misinterprets our deci­&para;<br>sion in Taylor. Accordingly, we reverse.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The starting point for our analysis is the proper inter­&para;<br>pretation of Reilly’s Schedule C. If we read the Schedule&para;<br>Reilly’s way, she claimed exemptions in her business&para;<br>equipment that could exceed statutory limits, and thus&para;<br>claimed exemptions to which Schwab should have objected&para;<br>if he wished to enforce those limits for the benefit of the&para;<br>estate. If we read Schedule C Schwab’s way, Reilly&para;<br>claimed valid exemptions to which Schwab had no duty to&para;<br>object. The Court of Appeals construed Schedule C Reil­&para;<br>ly’s way and interpreted her claimed exemptions as im­&para;<br>proper, and therefore objectionable, even though their&para;<br>declared value was facially within the applicable Code&para;<br>limits. In so doing, the Court of Appeals held that trustees&para;<br>evaluating the validity of exemptions in cases like this&para;<br>cannot take a debtor’s claim at face value, and specifically&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Compare&para;<br>&para;<br>In re Williams, 104 F. 3d 688, 690 (CA4 1997) (holding&para;<br>that interested parties have no duty to object to a claimed exemption&para;<br>where the dollar amount the debtor assigns the exemption is facially&para;<br>within the range the Code allows for the type of property in issue); In re&para;<br>Wick, 276 F. 3d 412 (CA8 2002) (employing reasoning similar to Wil&para;<br>liams, but stopping short of articulating a clear rule), with In re Green,&para;<br>31 F. 3d 1098, 1100 (CA11 1994) (“A debtor who exempts the entire&para;<br>reported value of an asset is claiming the [asset’s] ‘full amount,’ what­&para;<br>ever it turns out to be”); In re Anderson, 377 B.

Relying on this premise, Reilly argues that&para;<br>where, as here, a debtor equates the total value of her&para;<br>claimed exemptions in a certain asset (column three) with&para;<br>her estimate of the asset’s market value (column four), she&para;<br>establishes the “property claimed as exempt” as the full&para;<br>value of the asset, whatever that turns out to be.

Schwab&para;<br>and amicus United States instead contend that the Code&para;<br>defines the “property” Reilly claimed as exempt under&para;<br>§522(l) as an “interest” whose value cannot exceed a cer­&para;<br>tain dollar amount.

Construing Reilly’s Schedule C in light of&para;<br>this statutory definition, they contend that Reilly’s&para;<br>claimed exemption was facially unobjectionable because&para;<br>the “property claimed as exempt” (i.e., two interests in her&para;<br>business equipment worth $8,868 and $1,850, respec­&para;<br>tively) is property Reilly was clearly entitled to exclude&para;<br>from her estate under the Code provisions she referenced&para;<br>in column 2. See supra, at 8 (citing §§522(d)(5) and (6)).&para;<br>Accordingly, Schwab and the United States conclude that&para;<br>Schwab had no obligation to object to the exemption in&para;<br>order to preserve for the estate any value in Reilly’s busi­&para;<br>ness equipment beyond the total amount ($10,718) Reilly&para;<br>properly claimed as exempt.&para;<br>We agree. The portion of §522(l) that resolves this case&para;<br>is not, as Reilly asserts, the provision stating that the&para;<br>“property claimed as exempt on [Schedule C] is exempt”&para;<br>unless an interested party objects. Rather, it is the por­&para;<br>tion of §522(l) that defines the target of the objection,&para;<br>namely, the portion that says Schwab has a duty to object&para;<br>to the “list of property that the debtor claims as exempt&para;<br>under subsection (b).” (Emphasis added.) That subsec­&para;<br>tion, §522(b), does not define the “property claimed as&para;<br>exempt” by reference to the estimated market value on&para;<br>which Reilly and the Court of Appeals rely. Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 22–23; 534 F. 3d, at 178. Section 522(b)&para;<br>refers only to property defined in §522(d), which in turn&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHWAB v. REILLY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>lists 12 categories of property that a debtor may claim as&para;<br>exempt. As we have recognized, most of these categories&para;<br>(and all of the categories applicable to Reilly’s exemptions)&para;<br>define the “property” a debtor may “clai[m] as exempt” as&para;<br>the debtor’s “interest”—up to a specified dollar amount—&para;<br>in the assets described in the category, not as the assets&para;<br>themselves. §§522(d)(5)–(6); see also §§522(d)(1)–(4), (8);&para;<br>Rousey v. Jacoway, 544 U. S. 320, 325 (2005); Owen v.&para;<br>Owen, 500 U. S. 305, 310 (1991). Viewing Reilly’s form&para;<br>entries in light of this definition, we agree with Schwab&para;<br>and the United States that Schwab had no duty to object&para;<br>to the property Reilly claimed as exempt (two interests in&para;<br>her business equipment worth $1,850 and $8,868) because&para;<br>the stated value of each interest, and thus of the “prop­&para;<br>erty claimed as exempt,” was within the limits the Code&para;<br>allows.7&para;<br>Reilly’s contrary view of Schwab’s obligations under&para;<br>§522(l) does not withstand scrutiny because it defines the&para;<br>target of a trustee’s objection—the “property claimed as&para;<br>exempt”—based on language in Schedule C and dictionary&para;<br>definitions of “property,” see Brief for Respondent 24–25,&para;<br>40–41, that the definition in the Code itself overrides.8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 Schwab’s statutory duty to object to the exemptions in this case&para;<br>turns solely on whether the value of the property claimed as exempt&para;<br>exceeds statutory limits because the parties agree that Schwab had no&para;<br>cause to object to Reilly’s attempt to claim exemptions in the equipment&para;<br>at issue, or to the applicability of the Code provisions Reilly cited in&para;<br>support of her exemptions.&para;<br>8 The dissent’s approach suffers from a similar flaw, and misstates&para;<br>our holding in critiquing it.

As noted above, §§522(d)(5) and (6) define the&para;<br>“property claimed as exempt” as an “interest” in Reilly’s&para;<br>business equipment, not as the equipment per se. Sections&para;<br>522(d)(5) and (6) further and plainly state that claims to&para;<br>exempt such interests are statutorily permissible, and&para;<br>thus unobjectionable, if the value of the claimed interest is&para;<br>below a particular dollar amount.9 That is the case here,&para;<br>and Schwab was entitled to rely upon these provisions in&para;<br>evaluating whether Reilly’s exemptions were objectionable&para;<br>under the Code. See Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540&para;<br>U. S. 526, 534 (2004); Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v.&para;<br>Union Planters Bank, N. A., 530 U. S. 1, 6 (2000). The&para;<br>Court of Appeals’ contrary holding not only fails to account&para;<br>for the Code’s definition of the “property claimed as ex­&para;<br>empt.” It also fails to account for the provisions in §522(d)&para;<br>that permit debtors to exempt certain property in kind or&para;<br>in full regardless of value. See, e.g., §§522(d)(9) (profes­&para;<br>sionally prescribed health aids), (10)(C) (disability bene­&para;<br>fits), (7) (unmatured life insurance contracts). We decline&para;<br>to construe Reilly’s claimed exemptions in a manner that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>this point.

See, e.g., Rousey, 544 U. S., at 325. It also accords with&para;<br>bankruptcy court decisions holding that where, as here, a debtor claims&para;<br>an exemption pursuant to provisions that (like §522(d)(6)) permit the&para;<br>debtor to exclude from the estate only an “interest” in certain property,&para;<br>the “property” that becomes exempt absent objection, §522(l), is only&para;<br>the “partial interest” claimed as exempt and not “the asset as a whole,”&para;<br>e.g., In re Soost, 262 B.

S. 167, 174 (2001), particularly based upon&para;<br>an entry on Schedule C—Reilly’s estimate of her equip­&para;<br>ment’s market value—to which the Code does not refer in&para;<br>defining the “property claimed as exempt.”10&para;<br>For all of these reasons, we conclude that Schwab was&para;<br>entitled to evaluate the propriety of the claimed exemp­&para;<br>tions based on three, and only three, entries on Reilly’s&para;<br>Schedule C: the description of the business equipment in&para;<br>which Reilly claimed the exempt interests; the Code provi­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 The dissent’s approach does not avoid these concerns. The dissent&para;<br>insists that “a debtor’s market valuation [of the equipment in which she&para;<br>claims an exempt interest] is an essential factor in determining the&para;<br>nature of the ‘interest’ [the] debtor lists as exempt” (and thus in deter­&para;<br>mining whether the claimed exemption is objectionable), because&para;<br>“without comparing [the debtor’s] market valuation of the equipment to&para;<br>the value of her claimed exemption” the trustee “could not comprehend&para;<br>whether [the debtor] claimed a monetary or an in-kind ‘interest’ in [the]&para;<br>equipment.” Post, at 9, n. 9. This argument overlooks the fact that&para;<br>there is another way the trustee could discern from the “face of the&para;<br>debtor’s filings,” post, at 7, n. 6, whether the debtor claimed as exempt&para;<br>a “monetary or an in-kind ‘interest’ in” her equipment, post, at 9, n. 9:&para;<br>The trustee could simply consult the Code provisions the debtor listed&para;<br>as governing the exemption in question. Here, those provisions,&para;<br>§§522(d)(5) and (d)(6), expressly describe the exempt interest as an&para;<br>“interest” “not to exceed” a specified dollar amount. Accordingly, it was&para;<br>entirely appropriate for Schwab to view Reilly’s schedule entries as&para;<br>exempting an interest in her business equipment in the (declared and&para;<br>unobjectionable) amounts of $1,850 and $8,868. Viewing the entries&para;<br>otherwise, i.e., as exempting the equipment in kind or in full no matter&para;<br>what its dollar value, would unnecessarily treat the exemption as&para;<br>violating the limits imposed by the Code provisions that govern it, as&para;<br>well as ignore the distinction between those provisions and the provi­&para;<br>sions that “authoriz[e] reclamation of the property in full without any&para;<br>cap on value,” post, at 7, n. 5. And it would do all of this based on&para;<br>information (identical dollar amounts in columns three and four of&para;<br>Schedule C) that Schwab and one of his amici say often result from a&para;<br>default setting in commercial bankruptcy software.

As&para;<br>noted, most assets become property of the estate upon&para;<br>commencement of a bankruptcy case, see 11 U. S. C. §541,&para;<br>and exemptions represent the debtor’s attempt to reclaim&para;<br>those assets or, more often, certain interests in those&para;<br>assets, to the creditors’ detriment. Accordingly, it is at&para;<br>least useful for a trustee to be able to compare the value of&para;<br>the claimed exemption (which typically represents the&para;<br>debtor’s interest in a particular asset) with the asset’s&para;<br>estimated market value (which belongs to the estate sub­&para;<br>ject to any valid exemption) without having to consult&para;<br>separate schedules.11&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent’s argument that the estimate plays a greater role, and&para;<br>is “vital,” post, at 8, to determining whether the value a debtor assigns&para;<br>the “property claimed as exempt” (here, an interest in certain business&para;<br>equipment) is objectionable, see post, at 8−9, lacks statutory support&para;<br>because the governing Code provisions phrase the exemption limit as a&para;<br>simple dollar amount. The dissent’s view, see post, at 7−9, might be&para;<br>plausible if the Code stated that the debtor could exempt an interest in&para;<br>her equipment “not to exceed” a certain percentage of the equipment’s&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHWAB v.

Congress has permitted debtors to&para;<br>exempt certain property from their bankruptcy estates for&para;<br>more than two centuries. See Act of Apr. 4, 1800, ch. 19,&para;<br>§5, 2 Stat. 23.12 Throughout these periods, debtors have&para;<br>validly exempted property based on forms that required&para;<br>the debtor to list the value of a claimed exemption without&para;<br>also estimating the market value of the asset in which the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>market value, because then it might be necessary to “compar[e] [the&para;<br>debtor’s] market valuation of the equipment to the value of her claimed&para;<br>exemption” to determine the exemption’s propriety. Post, at 9, n. 9.&para;<br>But the Code does not phrase the exemption cap in such terms. More­&para;<br>over, even accepting that the equivalent Schedule C entries the dissent&para;<br>relies upon represent a claim to exempt an asset’s full value, the&para;<br>dissent does not explain why this equivalence precludes a trustee from&para;<br>relying on the dollar amount the debtor expressly assigns both entries.&para;<br>According to the dissent, a trustee faced with such entries should&para;<br>assume not only that the debtor reclaims from the estate what she&para;<br>believes to be the full value of an asset in which the Code allows her to&para;<br>exempt an interest “not to exceed” a certain dollar amount, e.g.,&para;<br>§522(d)(6), but also that the debtor would continue to claim the asset’s&para;<br>full value as exempt even if that value exceeds her estimate to a point&para;<br>that would cause her claim to violate the Code. The schedule entries&para;<br>themselves do not compel this assumption, and the Code provisions&para;<br>they invoke undercut it.

See 503 U. S., at&para;<br>642. Accordingly, although this case and Taylor both&para;<br>concern the consequences of a trustee’s failure to object to&para;<br>a claimed exemption within the time specified by Rule&para;<br>4003, the question arose in Taylor on starkly different&para;<br>facts. In Taylor, the question concerned a trustee’s obliga­&para;<br>tion to object to the debtor’s entry of a “value claimed&para;<br>exempt” that was not plainly within the limits the Code&para;<br>allows. In this case, the opposite is true. The amounts&para;<br>Reilly listed in the Schedule C column titled “Value of&para;<br>Claimed Exemption” are facially within the limits the&para;<br>Code prescribes and raise no warning flags that warranted&para;<br>an objection.16 See supra, at 8.&para;<br>Taylor supports this conclusion. In holding otherwise,&para;<br>the Court of Appeals focused on what it described as Tay&para;<br>lor’s “ ‘unstated premise’ ” that “ ‘a debtor who exempts the&para;<br>entire reported value of an asset is claiming the “full&para;<br>amount,” whatever it turns out to be.’ ” 534 F. 3d, at 179.&para;<br>But Taylor does not rest on this premise. It establishes&para;<br>and applies the straightforward proposition that an inter­&para;<br>ested party must object to a claimed exemption if the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>16 See, e.g., Barroso-Herrans, 524 F. 3d, at 345 (explaining that Sche­&para;<br>dule C entries listing the value of a claimed exemption as “unknown,”&para;<br>“to be determined,” or “100%” are “ ‘red flags to trustees and creditors,’&para;<br>and therefore put them on notice that if they do not object, the whole&para;<br>value of the asset—whatever it might later turn out to be—will be&para;<br>exempt” (quoting 1 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶8.06[1][c][ii] (15th ed. rev.&para;<br>2007); citation and some internal quotation marks omitted)). The&para;<br>dissent concedes that a debtor’s exemption schedule “must give notice&para;<br>sufficient to cue the trustee that an objection may be in order,” and&para;<br>rightly observes that the sufficiency of a particular cue, or “ ‘ warning&para;<br>flag,’ ” may lie “in the eye of the beholder.” Post, at 14. In this case,&para;<br>however, the Code itself breaks the tie between what might otherwise&para;<br>be two equally tenable views.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHWAB v. REILLY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>amount the debtor lists as the “value claimed exempt” is&para;<br>not within statutory limits, a test the value ($ unknown)&para;<br>in Taylor failed, and the values ($8,868 and $1,850) in this&para;<br>case pass.&para;<br>We adhere to this test. Doing otherwise would not only&para;<br>depart from Taylor and ignore the presumption that par­&para;<br>ties act lawfully and with knowledge of the law, cf. United&para;<br>States v. Budd, 144 U. S. 154, 163 (1892); it would also&para;<br>require us to expand the statutory definition of “property&para;<br>claimed as exempt” and the universe of information an&para;<br>interested party must consider in evaluating the validity&para;<br>of a claimed exemption. Even if the Code allowed such&para;<br>expansions, they would be ill advised. As evidenced by the&para;<br>differences between Reilly’s Schedule C and the schedule&para;<br>in Taylor, preprinted bankruptcy schedules change over&para;<br>time. Basing the definition of the “property claimed as&para;<br>exempt,” and thus an interested party’s obligation to&para;<br>object under §522(l), on inferences that party must draw&para;<br>from evolving forms, rather than on the facial validity of&para;<br>the value the debtor assigns the “property claimed as&para;<br>exempt” as defined by the Code, would undermine the&para;<br>predictability the statute is designed to provide.17 For all&para;<br>of these reasons, we take Reilly’s exemptions at face value&para;<br>and find them unobjectionable under the Code, so the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>17 Reilly insists that our conclusion should nonetheless be avoided&para;<br>because “procedures that burden the debtor’s exemption entitlements,&para;<br>like those that impair a debtor’s discharge generally, are to be con­&para;<br>strued narrowly.” Brief for Respondent 33 (citing Kawaauhau v.&para;<br>Geiger, 523 U.

First, the only burdens our conclusion imposes are bur­&para;<br>dens the Code itself prescribes, specifically, the burdens the Code&para;<br>places on debtors to state their claimed exemptions accurately and to&para;<br>conform such claims to statutory limits. Second, and in any event,&para;<br>Geiger and the other cases Reilly cites emphasize in the discharge&para;<br>context the importance of limiting exceptions to discharge to “those&para;<br>plainly expressed,” a principle that supports our approach here.

See Brief for Re­&para;<br>spondent 21, 55–68. Although none of Reilly’s policy&para;<br>arguments can overcome the Code provisions or the as­&para;<br>pects of Taylor that govern this case, our decision fully&para;<br>accords with all of the policies she identifies. We agree&para;<br>that “exemptions in bankruptcy cases are part and parcel&para;<br>of the fundamental bankruptcy concept of a ‘fresh start.’ ”&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 21 (quoting Rousey, 544 U.

We disagree that this policy required&para;<br>Schwab to object to a facially valid claim of exemption on&para;<br>pain of forfeiting his ability to preserve for the estate any&para;<br>value in Reilly’s business equipment beyond the value of&para;<br>the interest she declared exempt. This approach threat­&para;<br>ens to convert a fresh start into a free pass.&para;<br>As we emphasized in Rousey, “[t]o help the debtor obtain&para;<br>a fresh start, the Bankruptcy Code permits him to with&para;<br>draw from the estate certain interests in property, such as&para;<br>his car or home, up to certain values.” 544 U. S., at 325&para;<br>(emphasis added). The Code limits exemptions in this&para;<br>fashion because every asset the Code permits a debtor to&para;<br>withdraw from the estate is an asset that is not available&para;<br>to his creditors. See §522(b)(1). Congress balanced the&para;<br>difficult choices that exemption limits impose on debtors&para;<br>with the economic harm that exemptions visit on creditors,&para;<br>and it is not for us to alter this balance by requiring trus­&para;<br>tees to object to claimed exemptions based on form entries&para;<br>beyond those that govern an exemption’s validity under&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHWAB v.

S. 84, 95 (1985).&para;<br>Reilly nonetheless contends that our approach creates&para;<br>perverse incentives for trustees and creditors to sleep on&para;<br>their rights. See Brief for Respondent 64, n. 10, 67–69.&para;<br>Again, we disagree. Where a debtor intends to exempt&para;<br>nothing more than an interest worth a specified dollar&para;<br>amount in an asset that is not subject to an unlimited or&para;<br>in-kind exemption under the Code, our approach will&para;<br>ensure clear and efficient resolution of competing claims to&para;<br>the asset’s value. If an interested party does not object to&para;<br>the claimed interest by the time the Rule 4003 period&para;<br>expires, title to the asset will remain with the estate pur­&para;<br>suant to §541, and the debtor will be guaranteed a pay­&para;<br>ment in the dollar amount of the exemption. If an inter­&para;<br>ested party timely objects, the court will rule on the&para;<br>objection and, if it is improper, allow the debtor to make&para;<br>appropriate adjustments.18&para;<br>Where, as here, it is important to the debtor to exempt&para;<br>the full market value of the asset or the asset itself, our&para;<br>decision will encourage the debtor to declare the value of&para;<br>her claimed exemption in a manner that makes the scope&para;<br>of the exemption clear, for example, by listing the exempt&para;<br>value as “full fair market value (FMV)” or “100% of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>18 We disagree that Reilly’s approach to exemptions would more effi­&para;<br>ciently dispose of competing claims to the asset. On Reilly’s view, a&para;<br>trustee would be encouraged (if not obliged) to object to claims to&para;<br>exempt a specific dollar amount of interest in an asset whenever the&para;<br>value of the exempt interest equaled the debtor’s estimate of the asset’s&para;<br>market value. Where the debtor genuinely intended to claim nothing&para;<br>more than the face value of the exempt interest (which is rational if a&para;<br>debtor wishes to ensure that his aggregate exemptions remain within&para;<br>statutory limits), such an approach would engender needless objections&para;<br>and litigation, particularly if the equation that would precipitate the&para;<br>objection often results from a default software entry.

If the trustee objects and the objection is&para;<br>sustained, the debtor will be required either to forfeit the&para;<br>portion of the exemption that exceeds the statutory allow­&para;<br>ance, or to revise other exemptions or arrangements with&para;<br>her creditors to permit the exemption. See Fed. Rule&para;<br>——————&para;<br>19 The dissent’s observations about the poor fit between our admoni­&para;<br>tion and a form entry calling for a dollar amount, see post, at 15, simply&para;<br>reflect the tension between the Code’s definition of “property claimed&para;<br>as exempt” (i.e., an interest, not to exceed a certain dollar amount, in&para;<br>Reilly’s business equipment) and Reilly’s attempt to convert into a&para;<br>dollar value an improper claim to exempt the equipment itself, “ ‘what­&para;<br>ever [its value] turns out to be.’ ” In re Reilly, 534 F. 3d 173, 178−179&para;<br>(CA3 2008). As the dissent concedes, “[s]ection 522(d) catalogs exemp­&para;<br>tions of two types.” Post, at 7, n. 5. “Most exemptions—and all of those&para;<br>Reilly invoked—place a monetary limit on the value of the property the&para;<br>debtor may reclaim,” and such exemptions are distinct from those made&para;<br>pursuant to Code provisions that “authoriz[e] reclamation of the prop­&para;<br>erty in full without any cap on value.” Ibid. Nothing about Reilly’s&para;<br>Schedule entries establishes that Schwab should have treated Reilly’s&para;<br>claim for $10,718, an unobjectionable amount under the Code provi­&para;<br>sions she expressly invoked, as an objectionable claim for thousands of&para;<br>dollars more than those provisions allow, or as a claim for an uncapped&para;<br>exemption under Code provisions she did not invoke and the dissent&para;<br>admits are “not at issue here.” Ibid.&para;<br>20 A trustee will not always file an objection. As the United States&para;<br>observes, Schwab did not do so in this case with respect to certain&para;<br>assets (perishable foodstuffs from Reilly’s commercial kitchen) that&para;<br>could not be readily sold. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae&para;<br>28, n. 7 (explaining that Schwab could have objected to Reilly’s claim of&para;<br>a wildcard exemption for an interest in the food totaling $2,036 because&para;<br>this claim, combined with her wildcard claims for an interest of $8,868&para;<br>in her business equipment and interests totaling $26 in her bank&para;<br>accounts, placed the total value of the interests she claimed exempt&para;<br>under the wildcard provision $975 above then-applicable limits).&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHWAB v.

See Brief for Respondent 57–59 (arguing that&para;<br>“[u]nder [Schwab’s] interpretation of Rule 4003(b), a&para;<br>debtor would never have the certainty of knowing whether&para;<br>or not he or she may keep her exempted property until the&para;<br>case had ended”); id., at 66.21&para;<br>For all of these reasons, the policy considerations Reilly&para;<br>cites support our approach.

According to Reilly, “once the&para;<br>thirty-day deadline passed without objection” to her claim, she was&para;<br>“entitled to know that she would emerge from bankruptcy with her&para;<br>cooking equipment intact.” Brief for Respondent 57. There are two&para;<br>problems with this argument. First, it assumes that the property she&para;<br>claimed as exempt was the full value of the equipment. That assump­&para;<br>tion is incorrect for the reasons we explain. Second, her argument&para;<br>assumes that a claim to exempt the full value of the equipment would,&para;<br>if unopposed, entitle her to the equipment itself as opposed to a pay­&para;<br>ment equal to the equipment’s full value. That assumption is at least&para;<br>questionable. Section 541 is clear that title to the equipment passed to&para;<br>Reilly’s estate at the commencement of her case, and §§522(d)(5) and&para;<br>(6) are equally clear that her reclamation right is limited to exempting&para;<br>an interest in the equipment, not the equipment itself. Accordingly, it&para;<br>is far from obvious that the Code would “entitle” Reilly to clear title in&para;<br>the equipment even if she claimed as exempt a “full” or “100%” interest&para;<br>in it (which she did not). Of course, it is likely that a trustee who fails&para;<br>to object to such a claim would have little incentive to do anything but&para;<br>pass title in the asset to the debtor.

REILLY&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>claimed exemptions, had made her position plain: She&para;<br>claimed as exempt the listed property itself—not the&para;<br>dollar amount, up to $10,718, that sale of the property by&para;<br>Schwab might yield. Because neither Schwab nor any&para;<br>creditor lodged a timely objection, the listed property&para;<br>became exempt, reclaimed as property of the debtor, and&para;<br>therefore outside the bankruptcy estate the trustee is&para;<br>charged to administer.&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Pursuant to §522(l), Reilly filed a list of property she&para;<br>claimed as exempt from the estate-in-bankruptcy. Her&para;<br>filing left no doubt that her exemption claim encompassed&para;<br>her entire inventory of kitchen equipment. Schwab, in&para;<br>fact, was fully aware of the nature of the claim Reilly&para;<br>asserted. At the meeting of creditors, Reilly reiterated&para;<br>that she sought to keep the equipment in her possession;&para;<br>she would rather discontinue the bankruptcy proceeding,&para;<br>she made plain, than lose her equipment. See supra, at 4,&para;<br>n. 3. Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b) requires the trustee, if he&para;<br>contests the debtor’s exemption claim in whole or part, to&para;<br>file an objection within 30 days after the meeting of credi­&para;<br>tors. Absent a timely objection, “the property claimed as&para;<br>exempt . . . is exempt.” §522(l); Rule 4003. That prescrip­&para;<br>tion should be dispositive of this case.&para;<br>The Court holds, however, that Schwab was not obliged&para;<br>to file a timely objection to the exemption Reilly claimed,&para;<br>and indeed could auction off her cooking equipment any­&para;<br>time prior to her discharge. In so holding, the Court de­&para;<br>crees that no objection need be made to a debtor’s valua­&para;<br>tion of her property.&para;<br>To support the conclusion that Rule 4003’s timely objec­&para;<br>tion requirement does not encompass the debtor’s estima­&para;<br>tion of her property’s market value, the Court homes in on&para;<br>the language of exemption prescriptions that are subject to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>a monetary cap.5 Those prescriptions, the Court points&para;<br>out, “define the ‘property’ a debtor may ‘clai[m] as exempt’&para;<br>as the debtor’s ‘interest’—up to a specified dollar&para;<br>amount—in the assets described in the category, not as&para;<br>the assets themselves.” Ante, at 10. So long as a debtor&para;<br>values her claimed exemption at a dollar amount below&para;<br>the statutory cap, the Court reasons, the claim is on-its­&para;<br>face permissible no matter the market value she ascribes&para;<br>to the asset. To evaluate the propriety of Reilly’s declared&para;<br>“interest” in her kitchen equipment, the Court concludes,&para;<br>Schwab was obliged promptly to inspect “three, and only&para;<br>three, entries on Reilly’s Schedule C: the description of the&para;<br>business equipment . . . ; the Code provisions governing&para;<br>the claimed exemptions; and the amounts Reilly listed in&para;<br>the column titled ‘value of claimed exemption.’ ” Ante, at&para;<br>12–13.6&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Section 522(d) catalogs exemptions of two types. Most exemptions—&para;<br>and all of those Reilly invoked—place a monetary limit on the value of&para;<br>the property the debtor may reclaim. See, e.g., §522(d)(2) (“motor&para;<br>vehicle”); §522(d)(3) (“household furnishings, household goods, wearing&para;<br>apparel, appliances, books, animals, crops, or musical instruments”);&para;<br>§522(d)(4) (“jewelry”). For certain exemptions not at issue here, the&para;<br>Bankruptcy Code authorizes reclamation of the property in full without&para;<br>any cap on value. See, e.g., §522(d)(7) (“unmatured life insurance&para;<br>contract”); §522(d)(9) (“[p]rofessionally prescribed health aids”);&para;<br>§522(d)(11)(A) (“award under a crime victim’s reparation law”).&para;<br>6 In support of its view that market value is not relevant to determin­&para;<br>ing the “property claimed as exempt” for purposes of Rule 4003(b)’s&para;<br>timely objection mandate, the Court observes that Schedule C did not&para;<br>require the debtor to list this information until 1991. Ante, at 14–15.&para;<br>Prior to 1991, however, debtors recorded market value on a different&para;<br>schedule. See Interim Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. Official Form 6, Sched­&para;<br>ule B–2 (1979) (requiring debtor to list the “[m]arket value of [her]&para;<br>interest [in personal property] without deduction for . . . exemptions&para;<br>claimed”). Trustees assessing the “property claimed as exempt,”&para;<br>therefore, have always been able, from the face of the debtor’s filings, to&para;<br>compare the value of the claimed exemption to the property’s declared&para;<br>market value. See Brief for National Association of Consumer Bank­&para;<br>ruptcy Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 34.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHWAB v. REILLY&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Court’s account, however, shuts from sight the vital&para;<br>part played by the fourth entry on Schedule C—current&para;<br>market value—when a capped exemption is claimed. A&para;<br>debtor who estimates a market value below the cap, and&para;<br>lists an identical amount as the value of her claimed ex­&para;<br>emption, thereby signals that her aim is to keep the listed&para;<br>property in her possession, outside the estate-in­&para;<br>bankruptcy. In contrast, a debtor who estimates a market&para;<br>value above the cap, and above the value of her claimed&para;<br>exemption, thereby recognizes that she cannot shelter the&para;<br>property itself and that the trustee may seek to sell it for&para;<br>whatever it is worth.7 Schedule C’s final column, in other&para;<br>words, alerts the trustee whether the debtor is claiming a&para;<br>right to retain the listed property itself as her own, a right&para;<br>secured to her if the trustee files no timely objection.8&para;<br>Because an asset’s market value is key to determining&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 By authorizing exemption of assets that a debtor would want to&para;<br>keep in kind, such as her jewelry and car, but limiting the exemptible&para;<br>value of this property, Congress struck a balance between debtors’&para;<br>and creditors’ interests: Debtors can reclaim items helpful to their&para;<br>fresh start after bankruptcy, but only if those items are of modest&para;<br>value. Assets of larger worth, however, are subject to liquidation so&para;<br>that creditors may obtain a portion of the item’s value. Cf. In re Price,&para;<br>370 F. 3d 362, 378 (CA3 2004) (“[B]ankruptcy law is bilateral, replete&para;<br>with protections and policy considerations favoring both debtors and&para;<br>creditors.”).&para;<br>8 The significance of market value is what differentiates capped ex­&para;<br>emptions from uncapped ones that permit debtors to exempt certain&para;<br>property in kind regardless of its worth. See supra, at 7, n. 5. For&para;<br>uncapped exemptions, the nature of the property the debtor has re­&para;<br>claimed is clear: If the exemption is valid, the debtor gets the asset in&para;<br>full every time. For capped exemptions, however, market value is a&para;<br>crucial component in determining whether the debtor gets the item&para;<br>itself or a sum of money representing a share of the item’s liquidation&para;<br>value. Reading Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b) to require objections to&para;<br>valuation thus does not, as the Court contends, “elid[e] the distinction”&para;<br>between capped and uncapped exemptions, ante, at 12 (emphasis&para;<br>added), but instead accounts for that distinction.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the character of the interest the debtor is asserting in that&para;<br>asset, Rule 4003(b) is properly read to require objections to&para;<br>valuation within 30 days, just as the Rule requires timely&para;<br>objections to the debtor’s description of the property, the&para;<br>asserted legal basis for the exemption, and the claimed&para;<br>value of the exemption. See 4 Collier ¶522.05[1], p. 522–&para;<br>28 (rev. 15th ed. 2005) (“[T]o evaluate the propriety of the&para;<br>debtor’s claim of exemption,” trustees need the informa­&para;<br>tion in all four columns of Schedule C; “[market] value” is&para;<br>“essential” to judging whether the claim is proper because&para;<br>“[e]xemption provisions often are limited according to . . .&para;<br>[the property’s] value.”). 9&para;<br>C&para;<br>Requiring objections to market valuation notably facili­&para;<br>tates the debtor’s fresh start, and thus best fulfills the&para;<br>prime purpose of the exemption prescriptions. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Burlingham v. Crouse, 228 U. S. 459, 473 (1913) (Bank­&para;<br>ruptcy provisions “must be construed” in light of policy “to&para;<br>give the bankrupt a fresh start.”). See also Rousey v.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Suggesting&para;<br>&para;<br>that this interpretation of Rule 4003(b) “lacks statutory&para;<br>support,” ante, at 13, n. 11, the Court repeatedly emphasizes that the&para;<br>Bankruptcy Code defines the “property claimed as exempt,” to which a&para;<br>trustee must object, as “the debtor’s ‘interest’—up to a specified dollar&para;<br>amount—in the assets described in [capped exemption] categor[ies],”&para;<br>ante, at 10; see, e.g., ante, at 11; ibid., n. 9; ante, at 21, n. 19. But the&para;<br>commonly understood definition of a property “interest” is “[a] legal&para;<br>share in something; all or part of a legal or equitable claim to or right&para;<br>in property. . . . Collectively, the word includes any aggregation of&para;<br>[such] rights.” Black’s Law Dictionary 828 (8th ed. 2004). Schwab,&para;<br>therefore, could not comprehend whether Reilly claimed a monetary or&para;<br>an in-kind “interest” in her kitchen equipment without comparing her&para;<br>market valuation of the equipment to the value of her claimed exemp­&para;<br>tion. See supra, at 8–9. In line with the statutory text, a debtor’s&para;<br>market valuation is an essential factor in determining the nature of the&para;<br>“interest” a debtor lists as exempt. Bankruptcy “forms, rules, treatise&para;<br>excerpts, and policy considerations,” ante, at 7, n. 5, corroborate, rather&para;<br>than conflict with, this reading of the Code.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHWAB v.

Would&para;<br>trustees lack fair notice of the need to object? And would&para;<br>debtors be tempted to undervalue their property in an&para;<br>effort to avoid the monetary cap on exemptions? In my&para;<br>judgment, all three questions should be answered no.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Court suggests that requiring timely objections to a&para;<br>debtor’s valuation of exempt property would saddle trus­&para;<br>tees with an unmanageable load. See ante, at 18 (declin­&para;<br>ing to “expand . . . the universe of information an inter­&para;<br>ested party must consider in evaluating the validity of a&para;<br>claimed exemption”). See also Brief for Petitioner 32–33;&para;<br>Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24.12 But trus­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 Money generated by liquidation of an asset will often be of less&para;<br>utility to a debtor, who will have to pay more to replace the item. See&para;<br>H. R. Rep. No. 95–595, p. 127 (1977) (noting that “household goods have&para;<br>little resale value” but “replacement costs of the goods are generally&para;<br>high”).&para;<br>12 This concern is questionable in light of the prevailing practice, for,&para;<br>as earlier noted, valuation objections are the most common Rule&para;<br>4003(b) challenge. See supra, at 2. By lopping off valuation disagree­&para;<br>ments from the timely objection requirement, see, e.g., ante, at 10–11,&para;<br>n. 8, the Court so severely shrinks the Rule’s realm that this question&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHWAB v. REILLY&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tees, sooner or later, must attempt to ascertain the market&para;<br>value of exempted assets. They must do so to determine&para;<br>whether sale of the items would likely produce surplus&para;<br>proceeds for the estate above the value of the claimed&para;<br>exemption, see §704(a)(1); the only question, then, is when&para;<br>this market valuation must occur—(1) within 30 days or&para;<br>(2) at any time before discharge? Removing valuation&para;<br>from Rule 4003’s governance thus does little to reduce the&para;<br>labors trustees must undertake.&para;<br>The 30-day objection period, I note, does not impose on&para;<br>trustees any additional duty, but rather guides the exer­&para;<br>cise of existing responsibilities; under Rule 4003(b), a&para;<br>trustee must rank evaluation of the debtor’s exemptions as&para;<br>a priority item in his superintendence of the estate.13 And&para;<br>if the trustee entertains any doubt about the accuracy of a&para;<br>debtor’s estimation of market value, the procedure for&para;<br>interposing objections is hardly arduous. The trustee need&para;<br>only file with the court a simple declaration stating that&para;<br>an item’s value exceeds the amount listed by the debtor.14&para;<br>——————&para;<br>arises: Why are trustees granted a full 30 days to lodge objections?&para;<br>Under the Court’s reading of the Rule, trustees need only compare a&para;<br>debtor’s Schedule C to the text of the exemption prescriptions to assess&para;<br>an exemption claim’s facial validity, with no further investigation&para;<br>necessary.

The Court rejected an argu­&para;<br>ment along these lines in Taylor, and should follow suit&para;<br>here.

Freeland &amp;&para;<br>Kronz, 503 U. S. 638 (1992)], trustees rarely fail to closely scrutinize&para;<br>vague exemption claims.”). Moreover, because valuation objections are&para;<br>already the norm, see supra, at 2, and 11, n. 12, few trustees would&para;<br>have to adjust their behavior.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>SCHWAB v.
