SANTA CLARA COUNTY, &para;<br>&para;<br>CALIFORNIA &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–1273. Argued January 19, 2011—Decided March 29, 2011&para;<br>Section 340B of the Public Health Services Act imposes ceilings on&para;<br>prices drug manufacturers may charge for medications sold to speci&para;<br>fied health care facilities (340B or covered entities), dominantly, local&para;<br>providers of medical care for the poor. The §340B ceiling-price pro&para;<br>gram (340B Program) is superintended by the Health Resources and&para;<br>Services Administration (HRSA), part of the Department of Health&para;<br>and Human Services (HHS). It is tied to the earlier-enacted, much&para;<br>larger Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, under which manufacturers&para;<br>gain Medicaid coverage for their drugs. To qualify for participation&para;<br>in this program, a manufacturer must enter into a standardized&para;<br>agreement with HHS undertaking to provide rebates to States on&para;<br>their Medicaid drug purchases. The amount of the rebates depends&para;<br>on a manufacturer’s “average” and “best” prices, as defined by legisla&para;<br>tion and regulation. The 340B Program, like the Medicaid Rebate&para;<br>Program, uses a form contract as an opt-in mechanism. The 340B&para;<br>Program also draws on the larger scheme’s pricing methodology. In&para;<br>the 340B Program’s contract, called the Pharmaceutical Pricing&para;<br>Agreement (PPA), manufacturers agree to charge covered entities no&para;<br>more than predetermined ceiling prices, derived from the “average”&para;<br>and “best” prices and rebates calculated under the Medicaid Rebate&para;<br>Program.&para;<br>HRSA may require a manufacturer who overcharges a covered en&para;<br>tity to reimburse that entity. HRSA may also terminate the manu&para;<br>facturer’s PPA, which terminates as well the manufacturer’s eligibil&para;<br>ity for Medicaid coverage of its drugs. Currently, HRSA handles&para;<br>overcharge complaints through informal procedures, but the 2010 Pa&para;<br>tient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) directs the Secre&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ASTRA USA, INC. v. SANTA CLARA COUNTY&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tary to develop formal procedures. Once those procedures are in&para;<br>place, HRSA will reach an “administrative resolution,” which will be&para;<br>subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act&para;<br>(APA). In addition to authorizing compensation awards to over&para;<br>charged entities, the PPACA provides for the imposition of monetary&para;<br>penalties payable to the Government.&para;<br>Respondent Santa Clara County (County), operator of several 340B&para;<br>entities, filed suit against Astra and eight other pharmaceutical com&para;<br>panies, alleging that they were overcharging 340B entities in viola&para;<br>tion of the PPAs. Asserting that 340B entities are the PPAs’ in&para;<br>tended beneficiaries, the County sought compensatory damages for&para;<br>breach of contract. The District Court dismissed the complaint, con&para;<br>cluding that the PPAs conferred no enforceable rights on 340B enti&para;<br>ties. Reversing, the Ninth Circuit held that, while 340B entities have&para;<br>no right to sue under the statute, they could proceed against drug&para;<br>manufacturers as third-party beneficiaries of the PPAs.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Suits by 340B entities to enforce ceiling-price contracts running&para;<br>between drug manufacturers and the Secretary of HHS are incom&para;<br>patible with the statutory regime. As the County has conceded, cov&para;<br>ered entities have no right of action under §340B itself. Congress&para;<br>vested authority to oversee compliance with the 340B Program in&para;<br>HHS and assigned no auxiliary enforcement role to covered entities.&para;<br>Nonetheless, the County maintains that the PPAs are contracts en&para;<br>forceable by covered entities as third-party beneficiaries. This argu&para;<br>ment overlooks that the PPAs simply incorporate statutory obliga&para;<br>tions and record the manufacturers’ agreement to abide by them.&para;<br>The agreements have no negotiable terms. Like the Medicaid Rebate&para;<br>Program agreements, the PPAs provide the means by which drug&para;<br>manufacturers opt into the statutory scheme. A third-party suit to&para;<br>enforce an HHS-drug manufacturer agreement, therefore, is in es&para;<br>sence a suit to enforce the statute itself. Telling in this regard, the&para;<br>County based its suit on allegations that the manufacturers charged&para;<br>more than the §340B ceiling price, not that they violated an inde&para;<br>pendent substantive obligation arising from the PPAs.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit reasoned that suits like the County’s would&para;<br>spread the enforcement burden instead of placing it entirely on the&para;<br>Government. But spreading the enforcement burden is hardly what&para;<br>Congress contemplated when it made HHS administrator of the in&para;<br>terdependent Medicaid Rebate Program and 340B Program. Suits by&para;<br>340B entities would undermine the agency’s efforts to administer&para;<br>these two programs harmoniously and uniformly. Notably, the Medi&para;<br>caid Rebate Program’s statute prohibits HHS from disclosing pricing&para;<br>information that could reveal the prices a manufacturer charges for&para;<br>its drugs.

But&para;<br>Congress did not respond to the reports of lax enforcement by invit&para;<br>ing 340B entities to launch lawsuits. Instead, Congress opted to&para;<br>strengthen and formalize HRSA’s enforcement authority, to make the&para;<br>new adjudicative framework the proper remedy for covered entities’&para;<br>complaints, and to render the agency’s resolution of those complaints&para;<br>binding, subject to judicial review under the APA.

Those facilities,&para;<br>here called “340B” or “covered” entities, include public&para;<br>hospitals and community health centers, many of them&para;<br>providers of safety-net services to the poor. The §340B&para;<br>ceiling-price program (340B Program) is superintended by&para;<br>the Health Resources and Services Administration&para;<br>(HRSA), a unit of the Department of Health and Human&para;<br>Services (HHS). Drug manufacturers opt into the 340B&para;<br>Program by signing a form Pharmaceutical Pricing&para;<br>Agreement (PPA) used nationwide. PPAs are not transac­&para;<br>tional, bargained-for contracts. They are uniform agree­&para;<br>ments that recite the responsibilities §340B imposes,&para;<br>respectively, on drug manufacturers and the Secretary of&para;<br>HHS. Manufacturers’ eligibility to participate in state&para;<br>Medicaid programs is conditioned on their entry into PPAs&para;<br>for covered drugs purchased by 340B entities.&para;<br>It is conceded that Congress authorized no private right&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ASTRA USA, INC. v. SANTA CLARA COUNTY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of action under §340B for covered entities who claim they&para;<br>have been charged prices exceeding the statutory ceiling.&para;<br>This case presents the question whether 340B entities,&para;<br>though accorded no right to sue for overcharges under the&para;<br>statute itself, may nonetheless sue allegedly overcharging&para;<br>manufacturers as third-party beneficiaries of the PPAs to&para;<br>which the manufacturers subscribed. We hold that suits&para;<br>by 340B entities to enforce ceiling-price contracts running&para;<br>between drug manufacturers and the Secretary of HHS&para;<br>are incompatible with the statutory regime.&para;<br>Congress placed the Secretary (acting through her&para;<br>designate, HRSA) in control of §340B’s drug-price pre­&para;<br>scriptions. That control could not be maintained were&para;<br>potentially thousands of covered entities permitted to&para;<br>bring suits alleging errors in manufacturers’ price calcula­&para;<br>tions. If 340B entities may not sue under the statute, it&para;<br>would make scant sense to allow them to sue on a form&para;<br>contract implementing the statute, setting out terms&para;<br>identical to those contained in the statute. Though labeled&para;<br>differently, suits to enforce §340B and suits to enforce&para;<br>PPAs are in substance one and the same.

The&para;<br>PPAs “specifically nam[e]” covered entities as the recipi­&para;<br>ents of discounted drugs, the County observes; indeed the&para;<br>very object of the agreements is to ensure that those enti­&para;<br>ties would be “charge[d] . . . no more than the ceiling&para;<br>price.” Brief for Respondent 33. When the Government&para;<br>uses a contract to secure a benefit, the County urges, the&para;<br>intended recipient acquires a right to the benefit enforce­&para;<br>able under federal common law.

S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ously and on a uniform, nationwide basis.6 Recognizing&para;<br>the County’s right to proceed in court could spawn a mul­&para;<br>titude of dispersed and uncoordinated lawsuits by 340B&para;<br>entities. With HHS unable to hold the control rein, the&para;<br>risk of conflicting adjudications would be substantial.&para;<br>As earlier noted, see supra, at 3, the Medicaid Rebate&para;<br>Program’s statute prohibits HHS from disclosing pricing&para;<br>information in a form that could reveal the prices a manu­&para;<br>facturer charges for drugs it produces. §1396r–8(b)(3)(D).7&para;<br>This ban on disclosure is a further indication of the in­&para;<br>compatibility of private suits with the statute Congress&para;<br>enacted. If Congress meant to leave open the prospect of&para;<br>third-party beneficiary suits by 340B entities, it likely&para;<br>would not have barred the potential suitors from obtaining&para;<br>the very information necessary to determine whether their&para;<br>asserted rights have been violated.8&para;<br>It is true, as the Ninth Circuit observed, that HHS’s&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Because the Ninth Circuit focused on the 340B Program in isolation,&para;<br>it failed to recognize that the interests of States under the Medicaid&para;<br>Drug Rebate Program and covered entities under the 340B Program&para;<br>may conflict. For example, “average” prices are used both to set the&para;<br>amount manufacturers must pay in Medicaid rebates and to establish&para;<br>§340B ceiling prices. §1396r–8(c); §256b(a)(1). Typically, the lower the&para;<br>“average” price, the lower a product’s price to a 340B entity. Brief for&para;<br>United States as Amicus Curiae in No. 09–15216, p. 31. But the higher&para;<br>the “average” price, the more a State Medicaid agency typically receives&para;<br>in rebates from the manufacturers. Ibid. HHS can use its expertise to&para;<br>ascertain and balance the competing interests. Id., at 31–32. Courts as&para;<br>first-line decisionmakers are not similarly equipped to deal with the&para;<br>whole picture.&para;<br>7 HHS interprets this provision, the United States informs us, as pro­&para;<br>hibiting the agency from disclosing to covered entities the ceiling prices&para;<br>calculated based on information submitted by the manufacturers. Brief&para;<br>for United States as Amicus Curiae 28.&para;<br>8 Going forward, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,&para;<br>Pub. L. 111–148, 124 Stat. 119, in conjunction with the new adminis­&para;<br>trative adjudication process directed by the Act, will require HHS to&para;<br>give covered entities access to some of the information submitted by&para;<br>manufacturers. Id., at 826, 42 U. S. C. A. §256b(d)(3)(B)(iii).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ASTRA USA, INC. v. SANTA CLARA COUNTY&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has published re­&para;<br>ports finding that “HRSA lacks the oversight mechanisms&para;<br>and authority to ensure that [covered] entities pay at or&para;<br>below the . . . ceiling price.” 588 F. 3d, at 1242 (quoting&para;<br>OIG, D. Levinson, Deficiencies in the Oversight of the&para;<br>340B Drug Pricing Program ii (OEI–05–02–00072, Oct.&para;<br>2005)). See also 588 F. 3d, at 1242–1243 (citing OIG, D.&para;<br>Levinson, Review of 340B Prices 11 (OEI–05–02–00073,&para;<br>July 2006) (estimating that covered entities overpaid $3.9&para;<br>million in June 2005 alone)). But Congress did not re­&para;<br>spond to the reports of inadequate HRSA enforcement by&para;<br>inviting 340B entities to launch lawsuits in district courts&para;<br>across the country. Instead, in the PPACA, Congress&para;<br>directed HRSA to create a formal dispute resolution pro­&para;<br>cedure, institute refund and civil penalty systems, and&para;<br>perform audits of manufacturers. 124 Stat. 823–827, 42&para;<br>U. S. C. A. §256b(d). Congress thus opted to strengthen&para;<br>and formalize HRSA’s enforcement authority, to make the&para;<br>new adjudicative framework the proper remedy for cov­&para;<br>ered entities complaining of “overcharges and other viola­&para;<br>tions of the discounted pricing requirements,” id., at 823,&para;<br>42 U. S. C. A. §256b(d)(1)(A), and to render the agency’s&para;<br>resolution of covered entities’ complaints binding, subject&para;<br>to judicial review under the APA, id., at 827, 42 U. S. C.
