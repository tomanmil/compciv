Argued February 20, 2013—Decided April 29, 2013&para;<br>Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) grants Virginia citizens&para;<br>access to all public records, but grants no such right to nonVirginians. Petitioners McBurney and Hurlbert, citizens of States&para;<br>other than Virginia, filed records requests under the Act. After each&para;<br>petitioner’s request was denied, they filed a 42 U. S. C. §1983 suit&para;<br>seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of the Privileges and Immunities Clause and, in Hurlbert’s case, the dormant&para;<br>Commerce Clause. The District Court granted Virginia’s motion for&para;<br>summary judgment, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Virginia’s FOIA does not violate the Privileges and Immunities&para;<br>Clause, which protects only those privileges and immunities that are&para;<br>“fundamental.” See Baldwin v. Fish and Game Comm’n of Mont.,&para;<br>436 U. S. 371, 382, 388. Pp. 3–12.&para;<br>(a) Hurlbert alleges that Virginia’s FOIA abridges his fundamental right to earn a living in his chosen profession—obtaining property&para;<br>records on behalf of his clients. While the Privileges and Immunities&para;<br>Clause protects the right of citizens to “ply their trade, practice their&para;<br>occupation, or pursue a common calling,” Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U. S.&para;<br>518, 524, the Court has struck down laws as violating this privilege&para;<br>only when they were enacted for the protectionist purpose of burdening out-of-state citizens. See, e.g., Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385,&para;<br>395, 397. The Virginia FOIA’s citizen/noncitizen distinction has a&para;<br>nonprotectionist aim. Virginia’s FOIA exists to provide a mechanism&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MCBURNEY v. YOUNG&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>for Virginia citizens to obtain an accounting from their public officials; noncitizens have no comparable need. Moreover, the distinction between citizens and noncitizens recognizes that citizens alone&para;<br>foot the bill for the fixed costs underlying recordkeeping in the Commonwealth. Any effect the Act has of preventing citizens of other&para;<br>States from making a profit by trading on information contained in&para;<br>state records is incidental. Pp. 4–6.&para;<br>(b) Hurlbert also alleges that Virginia’s FOIA abridges the right&para;<br>to own and transfer property in the Commonwealth. The right to&para;<br>take, hold, and dispose of property has long been seen as one of the&para;<br>privileges of citizenship. See, e.g., Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180.&para;<br>However, Virginia law does not prevent noncitizens from obtaining&para;<br>documents necessary to the transfer of property. Records—like title&para;<br>and mortgage documents—maintained by the clerk of each circuit&para;<br>court are available to inspection by any person. Real estate tax assessment records are considered nonconfidential and are often posted&para;<br>online, a practice followed by the county from which Hurlbert sought&para;<br>records. Requiring a noncitizen to obtain records through the clerk’s&para;<br>office or on the Internet, instead of through a burdensome FOIA process, cannot be said to impose a significant burden on the ability to&para;<br>own or transfer property in Virginia. Pp. 6–8.&para;<br>(c) McBurney alleges that Virginia’s FOIA impermissibly burdens his access to public proceedings. The Privileges and Immunities&para;<br>Clause “secures citizens of one state the right to resort to the courts&para;<br>of another, equally with the citizens of the latter state,” Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Clarendon Boat Oar Co., 257 U. S. 533, 535, but that&para;<br>“requirement is satisfied if the nonresident is given access . . . upon&para;<br>terms which . . . are reasonable and adequate for the enforcing of any&para;<br>rights he may have, even though they may not be . . . the same in extent as those accorded to resident citizens,” Canadian Northern R.&para;<br>Co. v. Eggen, 252 U. S. 553, 562. Virginia’s FOIA clearly does not deprive noncitizens of “reasonable and adequate” access to Commonwealth courts. Virginia’s court rules provide noncitizens access to&para;<br>nonpriviledged documents needed in litigation, and Virginia law&para;<br>gives citizens and noncitizens alike access to judicial records and to&para;<br>records pertaining directly to them. For example, McBurney utilized&para;<br>Virginia’s Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices&para;<br>Act to receive much of the information he had sought in his FOIA request. Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(d) Petitioners’ sweeping claim that the Virginia FOIA violates&para;<br>the Privileges and Immunities Clause because it denies them the&para;<br>right to access public information on equal terms with Commonwealth citizens is rejected because the right to access public information is not a “fundamental” privilege or immunity of citizenship.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>The Court has repeatedly stated that the Constitution does not guarantee the existence of FOIA laws. See, e.g., Los Angeles Police Dept.&para;<br>v. United Reporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S. 32, 40. Moreover, no&para;<br>such right was recognized at common law or in the early Republic.&para;<br>Nor is such a sweeping right “basic to the maintenance or well-being&para;<br>of the Union.” Baldwin, supra, at 388. Pp. 10–12.&para;<br>2. Virginia’s FOIA does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.&para;<br>The “common thread” among this Court’s dormant Commerce Clause&para;<br>cases is that “the State interfered with the natural functioning of the&para;<br>interstate market either through prohibition or thorough burdensome&para;<br>regulation.” Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 806.&para;<br>Virginia’s FOIA, by contrast, neither prohibits access to an interstate&para;<br>market nor imposes burdensome regulation on that market. Accordingly, this is not properly viewed as a dormant Commerce Clause&para;<br>case. Even shoehorned into the Court’s dormant Commerce Clause&para;<br>framework, however, Hurlbert’s claim would fail. Insofar as there is&para;<br>a “market” for public documents in Virginia, it is a market for a&para;<br>product that the Commonwealth has created and of which the Commonwealth is the sole manufacturer. A State does not violate the&para;<br>dormant Commerce Clause when, having created a market through a&para;<br>state program, it “limits benefits generated by [that] state program to&para;<br>those who fund the state treasury and whom the State was created to&para;<br>serve.” Reeves, Inc. v.

Code Ann. §2.2–3700 et seq.,&para;<br>violates either the Privileges and Immunities Clause of&para;<br>Article IV of the Constitution or the dormant Commerce&para;<br>Clause.

By&para;<br>means other than the state FOIA, Virginia made available&para;<br>to petitioners most of the information that they sought,&para;<br>and the Commonwealth’s refusal to furnish the additional&para;<br>information did not abridge any constitutionally protected&para;<br>privilege or immunity. Nor did Virginia violate the dor-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MCBURNEY v. YOUNG&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>mant Commerce Clause. The state Freedom of Information Act does not regulate commerce in any meaningful&para;<br>sense, but instead provides a service that is related to&para;<br>state citizenship.

After his ex-wife defaulted on her&para;<br>child support obligations, McBurney asked the Commonwealth’s Division of Child Support Enforcement to file a&para;<br>petition for child support on his behalf. The agency complied, but only after a 9-month delay. McBurney attributes that delay to agency error and says that it cost him&para;<br>nine months of child support. To ascertain the reason for&para;<br>the agency’s delay, McBurney filed a Virginia FOIA request seeking “all emails, notes, files, memos, reports,&para;<br>letters, policies, [and] opinions” pertaining to his family,&para;<br>along with all documents “regarding [his] application for&para;<br>child support” and all documents pertaining to the handling of child support claims like his.

In 2008, Hurlbert was hired by a&para;<br>land/title company to obtain real estate tax records for&para;<br>properties in Henrico County, Virginia. He filed a Virginia&para;<br>FOIA request for the documents with the Henrico County&para;<br>Real Estate Assessor’s Office, but his request was denied&para;<br>because he was not a Virginia citizen.&para;<br>Petitioners filed suit under 42 U.

Supp. 2d 439 (ED Va. 2011), and the&para;<br>Court of Appeals affirmed, 667 F. 3d 454 (CA4 2012).&para;<br>Like Virginia, several other States have enacted freedom of information laws that are available only to their&para;<br>citizens.

Minner, 458 F. 3d 194&para;<br>(2006), the Third Circuit held that this feature of Delaware’s FOIA violated the Privileges and Immunities&para;<br>Clause. We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. 568&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2012).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, “[t]he Citizens of each State [are] entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.” U. S. Const.,&para;<br>Art. IV, §2, cl. 1. We have said that “[t]he object of&para;<br>the Privileges and Immunities Clause is to ‘strongly . . .&para;<br>constitute the citizens of the United States [as] one peo-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MCBURNEY v. YOUNG&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ple,’ by ‘plac[ing] the citizens of each State upon the same&para;<br>footing with citizens of other States, so far as the advantages resulting from citizenship in those States are&para;<br>concerned.’ ” Lunding v. New York Tax Appeals Tribunal,&para;<br>522 U. S. 287, 296 (1998) (quoting Paul v. Virginia, 8&para;<br>Wall. 168, 180 (1869)). This does not mean, we have&para;<br>cautioned, that “state citizenship or residency may never&para;<br>be used by a State to distinguish among persons.” Baldwin v. Fish and Game Comm’n of Mont., 436 U. S. 371,&para;<br>383 (1978). “Nor must a State always apply all its laws or&para;<br>all its services equally to anyone, resident or nonresident,&para;<br>who may request it so to do.” Ibid. Rather, we have long&para;<br>held that the Privileges and Immunities Clause protects&para;<br>only those privileges and immunities that are “fundamental.” See, e.g., id., at 382, 388.&para;<br>Petitioners allege that Virginia’s citizens-only FOIA&para;<br>provision violates four different “fundamental” privileges&para;<br>or immunities: the opportunity to pursue a common calling, the ability to own and transfer property, access to the&para;<br>Virginia courts, and access to public information. The first&para;<br>three items on that list, however, are not abridged by the&para;<br>Virginia FOIA, and the fourth—framed broadly—is not&para;<br>protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Hurlbert argues that Virginia’s citizens-only FOIA provision abridges his ability to earn a living in his chosen&para;<br>profession, namely, obtaining property records from state&para;<br>and local governments on behalf of clients. He is correct&para;<br>that the Privileges and Immunities Clause protects the&para;<br>right of citizens to “ply their trade, practice their occupation, or pursue a common calling.” Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437&para;<br>U. S. 518, 524 (1978); Supreme Court of N. H. v. Piper, 470&para;<br>U. S. 274, 280 (1985) (“ ‘[O]ne of the privileges which the&para;<br>Clause guarantees to citizens of State A is that of doing&para;<br>business in State B on terms of substantial equality with&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the citizens of that State’ ”). But the Virginia FOIA does&para;<br>not abridge Hulbert’s ability to engage in a common calling in the sense prohibited by the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Rather, the Court has struck laws down as&para;<br>violating the privilege of pursuing a common calling only&para;<br>when those laws were enacted for the protectionist purpose of burdening out-of-state citizens. See, e.g., Hicklin,&para;<br>supra, (striking down as a violation of noncitizens’ privileges and immunities an “Alaska Hire” statute containing&para;<br>a resident hiring preference for all employment related to&para;<br>the development of the State’s oil and gas resources);&para;<br>Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385, 395, 397 (1948) (striking&para;<br>down a South Carolina statute imposing a $2,500 license&para;<br>fee on out-of-state shrimping boats and only a $25 fee on&para;<br>in-state shrimping boats where petitioners alleged that&para;<br>the “purpose and effect of this statute . . . [was] not to&para;<br>conserve shrimp, but to exclude non-residents and thereby&para;<br>create a commercial monopoly for South Carolina residents,” and the “record cas[t] some doubt on” the State’s&para;<br>counterassertion that the statute’s “obvious purpose was&para;<br>to conserve its shrimp supply”); United Building &amp; Constr.&para;<br>Trades Council of Camden Cty. v.

S. 208 (1984) (New Jersey municipal&para;<br>ordinance requiring that at least 40% of employees of&para;<br>contractors and subcontractors working on city construction projects be city residents facially burdened out-ofstate citizens’ ability to pursue a common calling). In each&para;<br>case, the clear aim of the statute at issue was to advantage in-state workers and commercial interests at the&para;<br>expense of their out-of-state counterparts.&para;<br>Virginia’s FOIA differs sharply from those statutes. By&para;<br>its own terms, Virginia’s FOIA was enacted to “ensur[e]&para;<br>the people of the Commonwealth ready access to public&para;<br>records in the custody of a public body or its officers and&para;<br>employees, and free entry to meetings of public bodies&para;<br>wherein the business of the people is being conducted.”&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MCBURNEY v. YOUNG&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Va. Code Ann. §2.2–3700(B) (Lexis 2011). Hurlbert does&para;<br>not allege—and has offered no proof—that the challenged&para;<br>provision of the Virginia FOIA was enacted in order to&para;<br>provide a competitive economic advantage for Virginia&para;<br>citizens. Cf. Hillside Dairy Inc. v. Lyons, 539 U. S. 59, 67&para;<br>(2003) (piercing a professedly nondiscriminatory statute to&para;<br>find economic protectionism). Rather, it seems clear that&para;<br>the distinction that the statute makes between citizens&para;<br>and noncitizens has a distinctly nonprotectionist aim. The&para;<br>state FOIA essentially represents a mechanism by which&para;<br>those who ultimately hold sovereign power (i.e., the citizens of the Commonwealth) may obtain an accounting&para;<br>from the public officials to whom they delegate the exercise of that power. See Va. Const., Art. I, §2; Va. Code&para;<br>Ann. §2.2–3700(B). In addition, the provision limiting the&para;<br>use of the state FOIA to Virginia citizens recognizes that&para;<br>Virginia taxpayers foot the bill for the fixed costs underlying recordkeeping in the Commonwealth. Tr. of Oral Arg.&para;<br>53–54. The challenged provision of the state FOIA does&para;<br>not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause simply&para;<br>because it has the incidental effect of preventing citizens&para;<br>of other States from making a profit by trading on information contained in state records. While the Clause&para;<br>forbids a State from intentionally giving its own citizens a&para;<br>competitive advantage in business or employment, the&para;<br>Clause does not require that a State tailor its every action&para;<br>to avoid any incidental effect on out-of-state tradesmen.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Hurlbert next alleges that the challenged provision of&para;<br>the Virginia FOIA abridges the right to own and transfer&para;<br>property in the Commonwealth. Like the right to pursue&para;<br>a common calling, the right to “take, hold and dispose of&para;<br>property, either real or personal,” has long been seen as&para;<br>one of the privileges of citizenship. See Corfield v. Coryell,&para;<br>6 F. Cas. 546, 552 (No. 3, 230) (CCED Pa. 1825); see also&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

Thus,&para;<br>if a State prevented out-of-state citizens from accessing&para;<br>records—like title documents and mortgage records—that&para;<br>are necessary to the transfer of property, the State might&para;<br>well run afoul of the Privileges and Immunities Clause.&para;<br>Cf. State v. Grimes, 29 Nev. 50, 85, 84 P. 1061, 1073 (1906)&para;<br>(“Caveat emptor being the rule with us in the absence of a&para;<br>special agreement, it is just and essential to the protection&para;<br>of persons intending to purchase or take incumbrances&para;<br>that they be allowed the right of inspection”); Jackson ex&para;<br>dem. Center v. Campbell, 19 Johns. 281, 283 (N. Y. 1822)&para;<br>(the “plain intention” of the State’s property records system was “to give notice, through the medium of the county&para;<br>records, to persons about to purchase”).&para;<br>Virginia, however, does not prevent citizens of other&para;<br>States from obtaining such documents. Under Virginia&para;<br>law, “any records and papers of every circuit court that are&para;<br>maintained by the clerk of the circuit court shall be open&para;<br>to inspection by any person and the clerk shall, when&para;<br>requested, furnish copies thereof.” Va. Code Ann. §17.1–&para;<br>208 (Lexis 2010). Such records and papers include records&para;<br>of property transfers, like title documents, §55–106 (Lexis&para;<br>2012); notices of federal tax liens and other federal liens&para;<br>against property, §55–142.1; notices of state tax liens&para;<br>against property, §58.1–314 (Lexis 2009) (state taxes&para;<br>generally), §58.1–908 (estate tax liens), §58.1–1805 (state&para;<br>taxes generally), §58.1–2021(A) (liens filed by agencies&para;<br>other than the Tax Commission); and notice of mortgages&para;<br>and other encumbrances, §8.01–241 (Lexis Supp. 2012).&para;<br>A similar flaw undermines Hurlbert’s claim that Virginia violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause by preventing citizens of other States from accessing real estate&para;<br>tax assessment records.

Virginia’s rules of&para;<br>civil procedure provide for both discovery, Va. Sup. Ct.&para;<br>Rule 4:1 (2012), and subpoenas duces tecum, Rule 4:9.&para;<br>There is no reason to think that those mechanisms are&para;<br>insufficient to provide noncitizens with any relevant,&para;<br>nonprivileged documents needed in litigation.&para;<br>Moreover, Virginia law gives citizens and noncitizens&para;<br>alike access to judicial records. Va. Code Ann. §17.1–208;&para;<br>see also Shenandoah Publishing House, Inc. v. Fanning,&para;<br>235 Va. 253, 258, 368 S. E. 2d 253, 256 (1988). And if&para;<br>Virginia has in its possession information about any person, whether a citizen of the Commonwealth or of another&para;<br>State, that person has the right under the Government&para;<br>Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act to inspect that information. §2.2–3806(A)(3) (Lexis 2011).&para;<br>McBurney’s own case is illustrative. When his FOIA&para;<br>request was denied, McBurney was told that he should&para;<br>request the materials he sought pursuant to the Govern-&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MCBURNEY v. YOUNG&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ment Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act.&para;<br>Upon placing a request under that Act, he ultimately&para;<br>received much of what he sought. Accordingly, Virginia’s&para;<br>citizens-only FOIA provision does not impermissibly burden noncitizens’ ability to access the Commonwealth’s&para;<br>courts.&para;<br>D&para;<br>Finally, we reject petitioners’ sweeping claim that the&para;<br>challenged provision of the Virginia FOIA violates the&para;<br>Privileges and Immunities Clause because it denies them&para;<br>the right to access public information on equal terms with&para;<br>citizens of the Commonwealth. We cannot agree that the&para;<br>Privileges and Immunities Clause covers this broad right.&para;<br>This Court has repeatedly made clear that there is no&para;<br>constitutional right to obtain all the information provided&para;<br>by FOIA laws. See Houchins v. KQED, Inc., 438 U. S. 1,&para;<br>14 (1978) (plurality opinion) (“ ‘The Constitution itself is&para;<br>[not] a Freedom of Information Act’ ”); see also Los Angeles&para;<br>Police Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp., 528&para;<br>U. S. 32, 40 (1999) (the Government could decide “not to&para;<br>give out [this] information at all”); Sorrell v. IMS Health&para;<br>Inc., 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip&para;<br>op., at 8) (“[T]his Court has never found that the First&para;<br>Amendment prohibits the government from restricting the&para;<br>use of information gathered pursuant to a regulatory&para;<br>mandate”).&para;<br>It certainly cannot be said that such a broad right has&para;<br>“at all times, been enjoyed by the citizens of the several&para;<br>states which compose this Union, from the time of their&para;<br>becoming free, independent, and sovereign.” Corfield, 6&para;<br>F. Cas., at 551. No such right was recognized at common&para;<br>law. See H. Cross, The People’s Right to Know 25 (1953)&para;<br>(“[T]he courts declared the primary rule that there was no&para;<br>general common law right in all persons (as citizens,&para;<br>taxpayers, electors or merely as persons) to inspect public&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>records or documents”). Most founding-era English cases&para;<br>provided that only those persons who had a personal&para;<br>interest in non-judicial records were permitted to access&para;<br>them. See, e.g., King v. Shelley, 3 T. R. 141, 142, 100 Eng.&para;<br>Rep. 498, 499 (K. B. 1789) (Buller, J.) (“[O]ne man has no&para;<br>right to look into another’s title deeds and records, when&para;<br>he . . . has no interest in the deeds or rolls himself ”); King&para;<br>v. Justices of Staffordshire, 6 Ad. &amp; E. 84, 101, 112 Eng.&para;<br>Rep. 33, 39 (K. B. 1837) (“The utmost . . . that can be said&para;<br>on the ground of interest, is that the applicants have a&para;<br>rational curiosity to gratify by this inspection, or that they&para;<br>may thereby ascertain facts useful to them in advancing&para;<br>some ulterior measures in contemplation as to regulating&para;<br>county expenditure; but this is merely an interest in obtaining information on the general subject, and would&para;<br>furnish an equally good reason for permitting inspection of&para;<br>the records of any other county: there is not that direct&para;<br>and tangible interest, which is necessary to bring them&para;<br>within the rule on which the Court acts in granting inspection of public documents”).&para;<br>Nineteenth-century American cases, while less uniform,&para;<br>certainly do not support the proposition that a broadbased right to access public information was widely recognized in the early Republic. See, e.g., Cormack v. Wolcott,&para;<br>37 Kan. 391, 394, 15 P. 245, 246 (1887) (denying mandamus to plaintiff seeking to compile abstracts of title records; “At common law, parties had no vested rights in the&para;<br>examination of a record of title, or other public records,&para;<br>save by some interest in the land or subject of record”);&para;<br>Brewer v. Watson, 71 Ala. 299, 305 (1882) (“The individual&para;<br>demanding access to, and inspection of public writings&para;<br>must not only have an interest in the matters to which&para;<br>they relate, a direct, tangible interest, but the inspection&para;<br>must be sought for some specific and legitimate purpose.&para;<br>The gratification of mere curiosity, or motives merely&para;<br>speculative will not entitle him to demand an examination&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MCBURNEY v.

L. R. 4th 680, 687, §2[b] (1984)&para;<br>(“[A]t common law, a person requesting inspection of a&para;<br>public record was required to show an interest therein&para;<br>which would enable him to maintain or defend an action&para;<br>for which the document or record sought could furnish&para;<br>evidence or necessary information”).&para;<br>Nor is such a sweeping right “basic to the maintenance&para;<br>or well-being of the Union.” Baldwin, 436 U. S., at 388.&para;<br>FOIA laws are of relatively recent vintage. The federal&para;<br>FOIA was enacted in 1966, §1, 80 Stat. 383, and Virginia’s&para;<br>counterpart was adopted two years later, 1968 Va. Acts ch.&para;<br>479, p. 690. There is no contention that the Nation’s unity&para;<br>foundered in their absence, or that it is suffering now&para;<br>because of the citizens-only FOIA provisions that several&para;<br>States have enacted.&para;<br>III&para;<br>In addition to his Privileges and Immunities Clause&para;<br>claim, Hurlbert contends that Virginia’s citizens-only&para;<br>FOIA provision violates the dormant Commerce Clause.&para;<br>The Commerce Clause empowers Congress “[t]o regulate&para;<br>Commerce . . . among the several States.” Art. I, §8, cl. 3.&para;<br>The Commerce Clause does not expressly impose any&para;<br>constraints on “the several States,” and several Members&para;<br>of the Court have expressed the view that it does not do so.&para;<br>See General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U. S. 278, 312&para;<br>(1997) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (“[T]he so-called ‘negative’&para;<br>Commerce Clause is an unjustified judicial intervention,&para;<br>not to be expanded beyond its existing domain”); United&para;<br>Haulers Assn. Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, 550 U. S. 330, 349 (2007) (THOMAS, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment) (“The negative Commerce Clause&para;<br>has no basis in the Constitution and has proved unworkable in practice”). Nonetheless, the Court has long inferred&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>that the Commerce Clause itself imposes certain implicit&para;<br>limitations on state power. See, e.g., Cooley v. Board of&para;<br>Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for Relief of&para;<br>Distressed Pilots, 12 How. 299, 318–319 (1852); cf. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 209 (1824) (Marshall, C. J.)&para;<br>(dictum).&para;<br>Our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence “significantly limits the ability of States and localities to regulate&para;<br>or otherwise burden the flow of interstate commerce.”&para;<br>Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 151 (1986). It is driven by&para;<br>a concern about “economic protectionism—that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors.” New Energy&para;<br>Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 273–274 (1988); see&para;<br>also Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978)&para;<br>(“The crucial inquiry . . . must be directed to determining&para;<br>whether [the challenged statute] is basically a protectionist measure, or whether it can fairly be viewed as a law&para;<br>directed to legitimate local concerns, with effects upon&para;<br>interstate commerce that are only incidental”).&para;<br>Virginia’s FOIA law neither “regulates” nor “burdens”&para;<br>interstate commerce; rather, it merely provides a service&para;<br>to local citizens that would not otherwise be available at&para;<br>all. The “common thread” among those cases in which the&para;<br>Court has found a dormant Commerce Clause violation&para;<br>is that “the State interfered with the natural functioning&para;<br>of the interstate market either through prohibition or&para;<br>through burdensome regulation.” Hughes v. Alexandria&para;<br>Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 806 (1976). Here, by contrast,&para;<br>Virginia neither prohibits access to an interstate market&para;<br>nor imposes burdensome regulation on that market.&para;<br>Rather, it merely creates and provides to its own citizens&para;<br>copies—which would not otherwise exist—of state records.&para;<br>As discussed above, the express purpose of Virginia’s&para;<br>FOIA law is to “ensur[e] the people of the Commonwealth&para;<br>ready access to public records in the custody of a public&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>MCBURNEY v. YOUNG&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>body or its officers and employees, and free entry to meetings of public bodies wherein the business of the people is&para;<br>being conducted.” Va. Code Ann. §2.2–3700(B). This case&para;<br>is thus most properly brought under the Privileges and&para;<br>Immunities Clause: It quite literally poses the question&para;<br>whether Virginia can deny out-of-state citizens a benefit&para;<br>that it has conferred on its own citizens. Cf. Missouri&para;<br>Pacific R. Co., 257 U. S., at 535 (analyzing whether the&para;<br>privilege of access to a State’s courts must be made available to out-of-state citizens equally with the citizens of the&para;<br>relevant State). Because it does not pose the question of&para;<br>the constitutionality of a state law that interferes with an&para;<br>interstate market through prohibition or burdensome&para;<br>regulations, this case is not governed by the dormant&para;<br>Commerce Clause.&para;<br>Even shoehorned into our dormant Commerce Clause&para;<br>framework, however, Hurlbert’s claim would fail. Insofar&para;<br>as there is a “market” for public documents in Virginia, it&para;<br>is a market for a product that the Commonwealth has&para;<br>created and of which the Commonwealth is the sole manufacturer. We have held that a State does not violate the&para;<br>dormant Commerce Clause when, having created a market through a state program, it “limits benefits generated&para;<br>by [that] state program to those who fund the state treasury and whom the State was created to serve.” Reeves,&para;<br>Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, 442 (1980). “Such policies,&para;<br>while perhaps ‘protectionist’ in a loose sense, reflect the&para;<br>essential and patently unobjectionable purpose of state&para;<br>government—to serve the citizens of the State.” Ibid.; cf.&para;<br>Department of Revenue of Ky. v. Davis, 553 U. S. 328,&para;<br>341 (2008) (“[A] government function is not susceptible to&para;<br>standard dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny owing to its&para;<br>likely motivation by legitimate objectives distinct from the&para;<br>simple economic protectionism the Clause abhors”). For&para;<br>these reasons, Virginia’s citizens-only FOIA provision does&para;<br>not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.
