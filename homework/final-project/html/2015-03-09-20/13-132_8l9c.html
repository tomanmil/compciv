CALIFORNIA&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA,&para;<br>&para;<br>FOURTH APPELLATE DISTRICT, DIVISION ONE&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 13–132.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued April 29, 2014—Decided June 25, 2014*&para;<br>&para;<br>In No. 13–132, petitioner Riley was stopped for a traffic violation,&para;<br>which eventually led to his arrest on weapons charges. An officer&para;<br>searching Riley incident to the arrest seized a cell phone from Riley’s&para;<br>pants pocket. The officer accessed information on the phone and noticed the repeated use of a term associated with a street gang. At the&para;<br>police station two hours later, a detective specializing in gangs further examined the phone’s digital contents. Based in part on photographs and videos that the detective found, the State charged Riley&para;<br>in connection with a shooting that had occurred a few weeks earlier&para;<br>and sought an enhanced sentence based on Riley’s gang membership.&para;<br>Riley moved to suppress all evidence that the police had obtained&para;<br>from his cell phone. The trial court denied the motion, and Riley was&para;<br>convicted. The California Court of Appeal affirmed.&para;<br>In No. 13–212, respondent Wurie was arrested after police observed him participate in an apparent drug sale. At the police station, the officers seized a cell phone from Wurie’s person and noticed&para;<br>that the phone was receiving multiple calls from a source identified&para;<br>as “my house” on its external screen. The officers opened the phone,&para;<br>accessed its call log, determined the number associated with the “my&para;<br>house” label, and traced that number to what they suspected was&para;<br>Wurie’s apartment. They secured a search warrant and found drugs,&para;<br>a firearm and ammunition, and cash in the ensuing search. Wurie&para;<br>was then charged with drug and firearm offenses. He moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of the apartment. The&para;<br>District Court denied the motion, and Wurie was convicted. The&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 13–212, United States v. Wurie, on certiorari to&para;<br>the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>First Circuit reversed the denial of the motion to suppress and vacated the relevant convictions.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The police generally may not, without a warrant, search digital&para;<br>information on a cell phone seized from an individual who has been&para;<br>arrested. Pp. 5–28.&para;<br>(a) A warrantless search is reasonable only if it falls within a specific exception to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement. See&para;<br>Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S. ___, ___. The well-established exception&para;<br>at issue here applies when a warrantless search is conducted incident&para;<br>to a lawful arrest.&para;<br>Three related precedents govern the extent to which officers may&para;<br>search property found on or near an arrestee. Chimel v. California,&para;<br>395 U. S. 752, requires that a search incident to arrest be limited to&para;<br>the area within the arrestee’s immediate control, where it is justified&para;<br>by the interests in officer safety and in preventing evidence destruction. In United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, the Court applied&para;<br>the Chimel analysis to a search of a cigarette pack found on the arrestee’s person. It held that the risks identified in Chimel are present in all custodial arrests, 414 U. S., at 235, even when there is no&para;<br>specific concern about the loss of evidence or the threat to officers in a&para;<br>particular case, id., at 236. The trilogy concludes with Arizona v.&para;<br>Gant, 556 U. S. 332, which permits searches of a car where the arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger&para;<br>compartment, or where it is reasonable to believe that evidence of the&para;<br>crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle, id., at 343. Pp. 5–8.&para;<br>(b) The Court declines to extend Robinson’s categorical rule to&para;<br>searches of data stored on cell phones. Absent more precise guidance&para;<br>from the founding era, the Court generally determines whether to exempt a given type of search from the warrant requirement “by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual’s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed&para;<br>for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.” Wyoming v.&para;<br>Houghton, 526 U. S. 295, 300. That balance of interests supported&para;<br>the search incident to arrest exception in Robinson. But a search of&para;<br>digital information on a cell phone does not further the government&para;<br>interests identified in Chimel, and implicates substantially greater&para;<br>individual privacy interests than a brief physical search. Pp. 8–22.&para;<br>(1) The digital data stored on cell phones does not present either&para;<br>Chimel risk. Pp. 10–15.&para;<br>(i) Digital data stored on a cell phone cannot itself be used as a&para;<br>weapon to harm an arresting officer or to effectuate the arrestee’s escape. Officers may examine the phone’s physical aspects to ensure&para;<br>that it will not be used as a weapon, but the data on the phone can&para;<br>endanger no one. To the extent that a search of cell phone data&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>might warn officers of an impending danger, e.g., that the arrestee’s&para;<br>confederates are headed to the scene, such a concern is better addressed through consideration of case-specific exceptions to the warrant requirement, such as exigent circumstances. See, e.g., Warden,&para;<br>Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 298–299. Pp. 10–12.&para;<br>(ii) The United States and California raise concerns about the&para;<br>destruction of evidence, arguing that, even if the cell phone is physically secure, information on the cell phone remains vulnerable to remote wiping and data encryption. As an initial matter, those broad&para;<br>concerns are distinct from Chimel’s focus on a defendant who responds to arrest by trying to conceal or destroy evidence within his&para;<br>reach. The briefing also gives little indication that either problem is&para;<br>prevalent or that the opportunity to perform a search incident to arrest would be an effective solution. And, at least as to remote wiping,&para;<br>law enforcement currently has some technologies of its own for combatting the loss of evidence. Finally, law enforcement’s remaining&para;<br>concerns in a particular case might be addressed by responding in a&para;<br>targeted manner to urgent threats of remote wiping, see Missouri v.&para;<br>McNeely, 569 U. S. ___, ___, or by taking action to disable a phone’s&para;<br>locking mechanism in order to secure the scene, see Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U. S. 326, 331–333. Pp. 12–15.&para;<br>(2) A conclusion that inspecting the contents of an arrestee’s&para;<br>pockets works no substantial additional intrusion on privacy beyond&para;<br>the arrest itself may make sense as applied to physical items, but&para;<br>more substantial privacy interests are at stake when digital data is&para;<br>involved. Pp. 15–22.&para;<br>(i) Cell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualitative&para;<br>sense from other objects that might be carried on an arrestee’s person. Notably, modern cell phones have an immense storage capacity.&para;<br>Before cell phones, a search of a person was limited by physical realities and generally constituted only a narrow intrusion on privacy.&para;<br>But cell phones can store millions of pages of text, thousands of pictures, or hundreds of videos. This has several interrelated privacy&para;<br>consequences. First, a cell phone collects in one place many distinct&para;<br>types of information that reveal much more in combination than any&para;<br>isolated record. Second, the phone’s capacity allows even just one&para;<br>type of information to convey far more than previously possible.&para;<br>Third, data on the phone can date back for years. In addition, an element of pervasiveness characterizes cell phones but not physical&para;<br>records. A decade ago officers might have occasionally stumbled&para;<br>across a highly personal item such as a diary, but today many of the&para;<br>more than 90% of American adults who own cell phones keep on their&para;<br>person a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives. Pp. 17–&para;<br>21.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(ii) The scope of the privacy interests at stake is further complicated by the fact that the data viewed on many modern cell phones&para;<br>may in fact be stored on a remote server. Thus, a search may extend&para;<br>well beyond papers and effects in the physical proximity of an arrestee, a concern that the United States recognizes but cannot definitively foreclose. Pp. 21–22.&para;<br>(c) Fallback options offered by the United States and California are&para;<br>flawed and contravene this Court’s general preference to provide&para;<br>clear guidance to law enforcement through categorical rules. See&para;<br>Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692, 705, n. 19. One possible rule is&para;<br>to import the Gant standard from the vehicle context and allow a&para;<br>warrantless search of an arrestee’s cell phone whenever it is reasonable to believe that the phone contains evidence of the crime of arrest. That proposal is not appropriate in this context, and would&para;<br>prove no practical limit at all when it comes to cell phone searches.&para;<br>Another possible rule is to restrict the scope of a cell phone search to&para;<br>information relevant to the crime, the arrestee’s identity, or officer&para;<br>safety. That proposal would again impose few meaningful constraints on officers. Finally, California suggests an analogue rule,&para;<br>under which officers could search cell phone data if they could have&para;<br>obtained the same information from a pre-digital counterpart. That&para;<br>proposal would allow law enforcement to search a broad range of&para;<br>items contained on a phone even though people would be unlikely to&para;<br>carry such a variety of information in physical form, and would&para;<br>launch courts on a difficult line-drawing expedition to determine&para;<br>which digital files are comparable to physical records. Pp. 22–25.&para;<br>(d) It is true that this decision will have some impact on the ability&para;<br>of law enforcement to combat crime. But the Court’s holding is not&para;<br>that the information on a cell phone is immune from search; it is that&para;<br>a warrant is generally required before a search. The warrant requirement is an important component of the Court’s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, and warrants may be obtained with increasing&para;<br>efficiency. In addition, although the search incident to arrest exception does not apply to cell phones, the continued availability of the exigent circumstances exception may give law enforcement a justification for a warrantless search in particular cases.

In&para;<br>the course of the stop, the officer also learned that Riley’s&para;<br>license had been suspended. The officer impounded Riley’s car, pursuant to department policy, and another&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>officer conducted an inventory search of the car. Riley was&para;<br>arrested for possession of concealed and loaded firearms&para;<br>when that search turned up two handguns under the car’s&para;<br>hood. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §§12025(a)(1), 12031(a)(1)&para;<br>(West 2009).&para;<br>An officer searched Riley incident to the arrest and&para;<br>found items associated with the “Bloods” street gang. He&para;<br>also seized a cell phone from Riley’s pants pocket. According to Riley’s uncontradicted assertion, the phone was a&para;<br>“smart phone,” a cell phone with a broad range of other&para;<br>functions based on advanced computing capability, large&para;<br>storage capacity, and Internet connectivity. The officer&para;<br>accessed information on the phone and noticed that some&para;<br>words (presumably in text messages or a contacts list)&para;<br>were preceded by the letters “CK”—a label that, he believed, stood for “Crip Killers,” a slang term for members&para;<br>of the Bloods gang.&para;<br>At the police station about two hours after the arrest, a&para;<br>detective specializing in gangs further examined the contents of the phone. The detective testified that he “went&para;<br>through” Riley’s phone “looking for evidence, because . . .&para;<br>gang members will often video themselves with guns or&para;<br>take pictures of themselves with the guns.” App. in No.&para;<br>13–132, p. 20. Although there was “a lot of stuff ” on the&para;<br>phone, particular files that “caught [the detective’s] eye”&para;<br>included videos of young men sparring while someone&para;<br>yelled encouragement using the moniker “Blood.” Id., at&para;<br>11–13. The police also found photographs of Riley standing in front of a car they suspected had been involved in a&para;<br>shooting a few weeks earlier.&para;<br>Riley was ultimately charged, in connection with that&para;<br>earlier shooting, with firing at an occupied vehicle, assault&para;<br>with a semiautomatic firearm, and attempted murder.&para;<br>The State alleged that Riley had committed those crimes&para;<br>for the benefit of a criminal street gang, an aggravating&para;<br>factor that carries an enhanced sentence.

He contended&para;<br>that the searches of his phone violated the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment, because they had been performed without a&para;<br>warrant and were not otherwise justified by exigent circumstances. The trial court rejected that argument. App.&para;<br>in No. 13–132, at 24, 26. At Riley’s trial, police officers&para;<br>testified about the photographs and videos found on the&para;<br>phone, and some of the photographs were admitted into&para;<br>evidence. Riley was convicted on all three counts and&para;<br>received an enhanced sentence of 15 years to life in prison.&para;<br>The California Court of Appeal affirmed. No. D059840&para;<br>(Cal. App., Feb. 8, 2013), App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 13–&para;<br>132, pp. 1a–23a. The court relied on the California Supreme Court’s decision in People v. Diaz, 51 Cal. 4th 84,&para;<br>244 P. 3d 501 (2011), which held that the Fourth Amendment permits a warrantless search of cell phone data&para;<br>incident to an arrest, so long as the cell phone was immediately associated with the arrestee’s person. See id., at&para;<br>93, 244 P. 3d, at 505–506.&para;<br>The California Supreme Court denied Riley’s petition for&para;<br>review, App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 13–132, at 24a, and we&para;<br>granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2014).&para;<br>B&para;<br>In the second case, a police officer performing routine&para;<br>surveillance observed respondent Brima Wurie make an&para;<br>apparent drug sale from a car. Officers subsequently&para;<br>arrested Wurie and took him to the police station. At the&para;<br>station, the officers seized two cell phones from Wurie’s&para;<br>person. The one at issue here was a “flip phone,” a kind of&para;<br>phone that is flipped open for use and that generally has a&para;<br>smaller range of features than a smart phone. Five to ten&para;<br>minutes after arriving at the station, the officers noticed&para;<br>that the phone was repeatedly receiving calls from a&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>source identified as “my house” on the phone’s external&para;<br>screen. A few minutes later, they opened the phone and&para;<br>saw a photograph of a woman and a baby set as the&para;<br>phone’s wallpaper. They pressed one button on the phone&para;<br>to access its call log, then another button to determine the&para;<br>phone number associated with the “my house” label. They&para;<br>next used an online phone directory to trace that phone&para;<br>number to an apartment building.&para;<br>When the officers went to the building, they saw Wurie’s&para;<br>name on a mailbox and observed through a window a&para;<br>woman who resembled the woman in the photograph on&para;<br>Wurie’s phone. They secured the apartment while obtaining a search warrant and, upon later executing the warrant, found and seized 215 grams of crack cocaine, marijuana, drug paraphernalia, a firearm and ammunition, and&para;<br>cash.&para;<br>Wurie was charged with distributing crack cocaine,&para;<br>possessing crack cocaine with intent to distribute, and&para;<br>being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.&para;<br>See 18 U. S. C. §922(g); 21 U. S. C. §841(a). He moved to&para;<br>suppress the evidence obtained from the search of the&para;<br>apartment, arguing that it was the fruit of an unconstitutional search of his cell phone. The District Court denied&para;<br>the motion. 612 F. Supp. 2d 104 (Mass. 2009). Wurie was&para;<br>convicted on all three counts and sentenced to 262 months&para;<br>in prison.&para;<br>A divided panel of the First Circuit reversed the denial&para;<br>of Wurie’s motion to suppress and vacated Wurie’s convictions for possession with intent to distribute and possession of a firearm as a felon. 728 F. 3d 1 (2013). The court&para;<br>held that cell phones are distinct from other physical&para;<br>possessions that may be searched incident to arrest without a warrant, because of the amount of personal data cell&para;<br>phones contain and the negligible threat they pose to law&para;<br>enforcement interests. See id., at 8–11.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 571 U. S. ___ (2014).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Fourth Amendment provides:&para;<br>“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and&para;<br>no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,&para;<br>supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly&para;<br>describing the place to be searched, and the persons or&para;<br>things to be seized.”&para;<br>As the text makes clear, “the ultimate touchstone of the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment is ‘reasonableness.’ ” Brigham City v.&para;<br>Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006). Our cases have determined that “[w]here a search is undertaken by law enforcement officials to discover evidence of criminal wrongdoing, . . . reasonableness generally requires the obtaining&para;<br>of a judicial warrant.” Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton,&para;<br>515 U. S. 646, 653 (1995). Such a warrant ensures that&para;<br>the inferences to support a search are “drawn by a neutral&para;<br>and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the&para;<br>officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of&para;<br>ferreting out crime.” Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S.&para;<br>10, 14 (1948). In the absence of a warrant, a search is&para;<br>reasonable only if it falls within a specific exception to the&para;<br>warrant requirement. See Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5–6).&para;<br>The two cases before us concern the reasonableness of a&para;<br>warrantless search incident to a lawful arrest. In 1914,&para;<br>this Court first acknowledged in dictum “the right on the&para;<br>part of the Government, always recognized under English&para;<br>and American law, to search the person of the accused&para;<br>when legally arrested to discover and seize the fruits or&para;<br>evidences of crime.” Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383,&para;<br>392. Since that time, it has been well accepted that such a&para;<br>search constitutes an exception to the warrant requirement. Indeed, the label “exception” is something of a&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>misnomer in this context, as warrantless searches incident&para;<br>to arrest occur with far greater frequency than searches&para;<br>conducted pursuant to a warrant. See 3 W. LaFave,&para;<br>Search and Seizure §5.2(b), p. 132, and n. 15 (5th ed.&para;<br>2012).&para;<br>Although the existence of the exception for such searches&para;<br>has been recognized for a century, its scope has been debated for nearly as long. See Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S.&para;<br>332, 350 (2009) (noting the exception’s “checkered history”). That debate has focused on the extent to which&para;<br>officers may search property found on or near the arrestee.&para;<br>Three related precedents set forth the rules governing&para;<br>such searches:&para;<br>The first, Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969), laid&para;<br>the groundwork for most of the existing search incident to&para;<br>arrest doctrine. Police officers in that case arrested&para;<br>Chimel inside his home and proceeded to search his entire&para;<br>three-bedroom house, including the attic and garage. In&para;<br>particular rooms, they also looked through the contents of&para;<br>drawers. Id., at 753–754.&para;<br>The Court crafted the following rule for assessing the&para;<br>reasonableness of a search incident to arrest:&para;<br>“When an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the arresting officer to search the person arrested in order&para;<br>to remove any weapons that the latter might seek to&para;<br>use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape. Otherwise, the officer’s safety might well be endangered,&para;<br>and the arrest itself frustrated. In addition, it is entirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for&para;<br>and seize any evidence on the arrestee’s person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction. . . .&para;<br>There is ample justification, therefore, for a search of&para;<br>the arrestee’s person and the area ‘within his immediate control’—construing that phrase to mean the area&para;<br>from within which he might gain possession of a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>weapon or destructible evidence.” Id., at 762–763.&para;<br>The extensive warrantless search of Chimel’s home did not&para;<br>fit within this exception, because it was not needed to&para;<br>protect officer safety or to preserve evidence. Id., at 763,&para;<br>768.&para;<br>Four years later, in United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S.&para;<br>218 (1973), the Court applied the Chimel analysis in the&para;<br>context of a search of the arrestee’s person. A police officer had arrested Robinson for driving with a revoked&para;<br>license. The officer conducted a patdown search and felt&para;<br>an object that he could not identify in Robinson’s coat&para;<br>pocket. He removed the object, which turned out to be a&para;<br>crumpled cigarette package, and opened it. Inside were 14&para;<br>capsules of heroin. Id., at 220, 223.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals concluded that the search was&para;<br>unreasonable because Robinson was unlikely to have&para;<br>evidence of the crime of arrest on his person, and because&para;<br>it believed that extracting the cigarette package and opening it could not be justified as part of a protective search&para;<br>for weapons. This Court reversed, rejecting the notion&para;<br>that “case-by-case adjudication” was required to determine&para;<br>“whether or not there was present one of the reasons&para;<br>supporting the authority for a search of the person incident to a lawful arrest.” Id., at 235. As the Court explained, “[t]he authority to search the person incident to a&para;<br>lawful custodial arrest, while based upon the need to&para;<br>disarm and to discover evidence, does not depend on what&para;<br>a court may later decide was the probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact&para;<br>be found upon the person of the suspect.” Ibid. Instead, a&para;<br>“custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a&para;<br>reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment; that&para;<br>intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest&para;<br>requires no additional justification.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Court thus concluded that the search of Robinson&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>was reasonable even though there was no concern about&para;<br>the loss of evidence, and the arresting officer had no specific concern that Robinson might be armed. Id., at 236.&para;<br>In doing so, the Court did not draw a line between a&para;<br>search of Robinson’s person and a further examination of&para;<br>the cigarette pack found during that search. It merely&para;<br>noted that, “[h]aving in the course of a lawful search come&para;<br>upon the crumpled package of cigarettes, [the officer] was&para;<br>entitled to inspect it.” Ibid. A few years later, the Court&para;<br>clarified that this exception was limited to “personal property . . . immediately associated with the person of the&para;<br>arrestee.” United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1, 15&para;<br>(1977) (200-pound, locked footlocker could not be searched&para;<br>incident to arrest), abrogated on other grounds by California v. Acevedo, 500 U. S. 565 (1991).&para;<br>The search incident to arrest trilogy concludes with&para;<br>Gant, which analyzed searches of an arrestee’s vehicle.&para;<br>Gant, like Robinson, recognized that the Chimel concerns&para;<br>for officer safety and evidence preservation underlie the&para;<br>search incident to arrest exception. See 556 U. S., at 338.&para;<br>As a result, the Court concluded that Chimel could authorize police to search a vehicle “only when the arrestee is&para;<br>unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger&para;<br>compartment at the time of the search.” 556 U. S., at 343.&para;<br>Gant added, however, an independent exception for a&para;<br>warrantless search of a vehicle’s passenger compartment&para;<br>“when it is ‘reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the&para;<br>crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.’ ” Ibid.&para;<br>(quoting Thornton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615, 632&para;<br>(2004) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment)). That exception stems not from Chimel, the Court explained, but from&para;<br>“circumstances unique to the vehicle context.” 556 U. S.,&para;<br>at 343.&para;<br>III&para;<br>These cases require us to decide how the search incident&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to arrest doctrine applies to modern cell phones, which are&para;<br>now such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that&para;<br>the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were&para;<br>an important feature of human anatomy. A smart phone&para;<br>of the sort taken from Riley was unheard of ten years ago;&para;<br>a significant majority of American adults now own such&para;<br>phones. See A. Smith, Pew Research Center, Smartphone&para;<br>Ownership—2013 Update (June 5, 2013). Even less sophisticated phones like Wurie’s, which have already faded&para;<br>in popularity since Wurie was arrested in 2007, have been&para;<br>around for less than 15 years. Both phones are based on&para;<br>technology nearly inconceivable just a few decades ago,&para;<br>when Chimel and Robinson were decided.&para;<br>Absent more precise guidance from the founding era, we&para;<br>generally determine whether to exempt a given type of&para;<br>search from the warrant requirement “by assessing, on the&para;<br>one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual’s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is&para;<br>needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental&para;<br>interests.” Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S. 295, 300&para;<br>(1999). Such a balancing of interests supported the search&para;<br>incident to arrest exception in Robinson, and a mechanical&para;<br>application of Robinson might well support the warrantless searches at issue here.&para;<br>But while Robinson’s categorical rule strikes the appropriate balance in the context of physical objects, neither of&para;<br>its rationales has much force with respect to digital content on cell phones. On the government interest side,&para;<br>Robinson concluded that the two risks identified in&para;<br>Chimel—harm to officers and destruction of evidence—are&para;<br>present in all custodial arrests. There are no comparable&para;<br>risks when the search is of digital data. In addition, Robinson regarded any privacy interests retained by an individual after arrest as significantly diminished by the fact&para;<br>of the arrest itself. Cell phones, however, place vast quantities of personal information literally in the hands of&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>individuals. A search of the information on a cell phone&para;<br>bears little resemblance to the type of brief physical search&para;<br>considered in Robinson.&para;<br>We therefore decline to extend Robinson to searches of&para;<br>data on cell phones, and hold instead that officers must&para;<br>generally secure a warrant before conducting such a&para;<br>search.&para;<br>A&para;<br>We first consider each Chimel concern in turn. In doing&para;<br>so, we do not overlook Robinson’s admonition that searches&para;<br>of a person incident to arrest, “while based upon the&para;<br>need to disarm and to discover evidence,” are reasonable&para;<br>regardless of “the probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact be found.” 414&para;<br>U. S., at 235. Rather than requiring the “case-by-case&para;<br>adjudication” that Robinson rejected, ibid., we ask instead&para;<br>whether application of the search incident to arrest doctrine to this particular category of effects would “untether&para;<br>the rule from the justifications underlying the Chimel&para;<br>exception,” Gant, supra, at 343. See also Knowles v. Iowa,&para;<br>525 U. S. 113, 119 (1998) (declining to extend Robinson to&para;<br>the issuance of citations, “a situation where the concern&para;<br>for officer safety is not present to the same extent and the&para;<br>concern for destruction or loss of evidence is not present at&para;<br>all”).&para;<br>1&para;<br>Digital data stored on a cell phone cannot itself be used&para;<br>as a weapon to harm an arresting officer or to effectuate&para;<br>the arrestee’s escape. Law enforcement officers remain&para;<br>free to examine the physical aspects of a phone to ensure&para;<br>that it will not be used as a weapon—say, to determine&para;<br>whether there is a razor blade hidden between the phone&para;<br>and its case. Once an officer has secured a phone and&para;<br>eliminated any potential physical threats, however, data&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>on the phone can endanger no one.&para;<br>Perhaps the same might have been said of the cigarette&para;<br>pack seized from Robinson’s pocket. Once an officer&para;<br>gained control of the pack, it was unlikely that Robinson&para;<br>could have accessed the pack’s contents. But unknown&para;<br>physical objects may always pose risks, no matter how&para;<br>slight, during the tense atmosphere of a custodial arrest.&para;<br>The officer in Robinson testified that he could not identify&para;<br>the objects in the cigarette pack but knew they were not&para;<br>cigarettes. See 414 U. S., at 223, 236, n. 7. Given that, a&para;<br>further search was a reasonable protective measure. No&para;<br>such unknowns exist with respect to digital data. As the&para;<br>First Circuit explained, the officers who searched Wurie’s&para;<br>cell phone “knew exactly what they would find therein:&para;<br>data. They also knew that the data could not harm them.”&para;<br>728 F. 3d, at 10.&para;<br>The United States and California both suggest that a&para;<br>search of cell phone data might help ensure officer safety&para;<br>in more indirect ways, for example by alerting officers that&para;<br>confederates of the arrestee are headed to the scene.&para;<br>There is undoubtedly a strong government interest in&para;<br>warning officers about such possibilities, but neither the&para;<br>United States nor California offers evidence to suggest&para;<br>that their concerns are based on actual experience. The&para;<br>proposed consideration would also represent a broadening&para;<br>of Chimel’s concern that an arrestee himself might grab a&para;<br>weapon and use it against an officer “to resist arrest or&para;<br>effect his escape.” 395 U. S., at 763. And any such threats&para;<br>from outside the arrest scene do not “lurk[ ] in all custodial&para;<br>arrests.” Chadwick, 433 U. S., at 14–15. Accordingly, the&para;<br>interest in protecting officer safety does not justify dispensing with the warrant requirement across the board.&para;<br>To the extent dangers to arresting officers may be implicated in a particular way in a particular case, they are&para;<br>better addressed through consideration of case-specific&para;<br>exceptions to the warrant requirement, such as the one for&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>exigent circumstances. See, e.g., Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 298–299 (1967) (“The&para;<br>Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to&para;<br>delay in the course of an investigation if to do so would&para;<br>gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others.”).&para;<br>2&para;<br>The United States and California focus primarily on the&para;<br>second Chimel rationale: preventing the destruction of&para;<br>evidence.&para;<br>Both Riley and Wurie concede that officers could have&para;<br>seized and secured their cell phones to prevent destruction&para;<br>of evidence while seeking a warrant. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 13–132, p. 20; Brief for Respondent in No.&para;<br>13–212, p. 41. That is a sensible concession. See Illinois&para;<br>v. McArthur, 531 U. S. 326, 331–333 (2001); Chadwick,&para;<br>supra, at 13, and n. 8. And once law enforcement officers&para;<br>have secured a cell phone, there is no longer any risk that&para;<br>the arrestee himself will be able to delete incriminating&para;<br>data from the phone.&para;<br>The United States and California argue that information on a cell phone may nevertheless be vulnerable to&para;<br>two types of evidence destruction unique to digital data—&para;<br>remote wiping and data encryption. Remote wiping occurs&para;<br>when a phone, connected to a wireless network, receives a&para;<br>signal that erases stored data. This can happen when a&para;<br>third party sends a remote signal or when a phone is&para;<br>preprogrammed to delete data upon entering or leaving&para;<br>certain geographic areas (so-called “geofencing”). See&para;<br>Dept. of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and&para;<br>Technology, R. Ayers, S. Brothers, &amp; W. Jansen, Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics (Draft) 29, 31 (SP 800–&para;<br>101 Rev. 1, Sept. 2013) (hereinafter Ayers). Encryption is&para;<br>a security feature that some modern cell phones use in&para;<br>addition to password protection. When such phones lock,&para;<br>data becomes protected by sophisticated encryption that&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>renders a phone all but “unbreakable” unless police know&para;<br>the password. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in&para;<br>No. 13–132, p. 11.&para;<br>As an initial matter, these broader concerns about the&para;<br>loss of evidence are distinct from Chimel’s focus on a&para;<br>defendant who responds to arrest by trying to conceal or&para;<br>destroy evidence within his reach. See 395 U. S., at 763–&para;<br>764. With respect to remote wiping, the Government’s&para;<br>primary concern turns on the actions of third parties who&para;<br>are not present at the scene of arrest. And data encryption is even further afield. There, the Government focuses&para;<br>on the ordinary operation of a phone’s security features,&para;<br>apart from any active attempt by a defendant or his associates to conceal or destroy evidence upon arrest.&para;<br>We have also been given little reason to believe that&para;<br>either problem is prevalent. The briefing reveals only a&para;<br>couple of anecdotal examples of remote wiping triggered&para;<br>by an arrest. See Brief for Association of State Criminal&para;<br>Investigative Agencies et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 13–&para;<br>132, pp. 9–10; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 13–132,&para;<br>p. 48. Similarly, the opportunities for officers to search a&para;<br>password-protected phone before data becomes encrypted&para;<br>are quite limited. Law enforcement officers are very&para;<br>unlikely to come upon such a phone in an unlocked state&para;<br>because most phones lock at the touch of a button or, as a&para;<br>default, after some very short period of inactivity. See,&para;<br>e.g., iPhone User Guide for iOS 7.1 Software 10 (2014)&para;<br>(default lock after about one minute). This may explain&para;<br>why the encryption argument was not made until the&para;<br>merits stage in this Court, and has never been considered&para;<br>by the Courts of Appeals.&para;<br>Moreover, in situations in which an arrest might trigger&para;<br>a remote-wipe attempt or an officer discovers an unlocked&para;<br>phone, it is not clear that the ability to conduct a warrantless search would make much of a difference. The need to&para;<br>effect the arrest, secure the scene, and tend to other press-&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ing matters means that law enforcement officers may well&para;<br>not be able to turn their attention to a cell phone right&para;<br>away. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 13–132, at 50; see also&para;<br>Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in No. 13–132, at&para;<br>19. Cell phone data would be vulnerable to remote wiping&para;<br>from the time an individual anticipates arrest to the time&para;<br>any eventual search of the phone is completed, which&para;<br>might be at the station house hours later. Likewise, an&para;<br>officer who seizes a phone in an unlocked state might not&para;<br>be able to begin his search in the short time remaining&para;<br>before the phone locks and data becomes encrypted.&para;<br>In any event, as to remote wiping, law enforcement is&para;<br>not without specific means to address the threat. Remote&para;<br>wiping can be fully prevented by disconnecting a phone&para;<br>from the network. There are at least two simple ways to&para;<br>do this: First, law enforcement officers can turn the phone&para;<br>off or remove its battery. Second, if they are concerned&para;<br>about encryption or other potential problems, they can&para;<br>leave a phone powered on and place it in an enclosure that&para;<br>isolates the phone from radio waves. See Ayers 30–31.&para;<br>Such devices are commonly called “Faraday bags,” after&para;<br>the English scientist Michael Faraday. They are essentially sandwich bags made of aluminum foil: cheap, lightweight, and easy to use. See Brief for Criminal Law Professors as Amici Curiae 9. They may not be a complete&para;<br>answer to the problem, see Ayers 32, but at least for now&para;<br>they provide a reasonable response. In fact, a number of&para;<br>law enforcement agencies around the country already&para;<br>encourage the use of Faraday bags. See, e.g., Dept. of&para;<br>Justice, National Institute of Justice, Electronic Crime&para;<br>Scene Investigation: A Guide for First Responders 14, 32&para;<br>(2d ed. Apr. 2008); Brief for Criminal Law Professors as&para;<br>Amici Curiae 4–6.&para;<br>To the extent that law enforcement still has specific&para;<br>concerns about the potential loss of evidence in a particular case, there remain more targeted ways to address&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>those concerns. If “the police are truly confronted with a&para;<br>‘now or never’ situation,”—for example, circumstances&para;<br>suggesting that a defendant’s phone will be the target of&para;<br>an imminent remote-wipe attempt—they may be able to&para;<br>rely on exigent circumstances to search the phone immediately. Missouri v. McNeely, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013)&para;<br>(slip op., at 10) (quoting Roaden v. Kentucky, 413 U. S.&para;<br>496, 505 (1973); some internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>Or, if officers happen to seize a phone in an unlocked&para;<br>state, they may be able to disable a phone’s automatic-lock&para;<br>feature in order to prevent the phone from locking and&para;<br>encrypting data. See App. to Reply Brief in No. 13–132, p.&para;<br>3a (diagramming the few necessary steps). Such a preventive measure could be analyzed under the principles set&para;<br>forth in our decision in McArthur, 531 U. S. 326, which&para;<br>approved officers’ reasonable steps to secure a scene to&para;<br>preserve evidence while they awaited a warrant. See id.,&para;<br>at 331–333.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The search incident to arrest exception rests not only on&para;<br>the heightened government interests at stake in a volatile&para;<br>arrest situation, but also on an arrestee’s reduced privacy&para;<br>interests upon being taken into police custody. Robinson&para;<br>focused primarily on the first of those rationales. But it&para;<br>also quoted with approval then-Judge Cardozo’s account of&para;<br>the historical basis for the search incident to arrest exception: “Search of the person becomes lawful when grounds&para;<br>for arrest and accusation have been discovered, and the&para;<br>law is in the act of subjecting the body of the accused to its&para;<br>physical dominion.” 414 U. S., at 232 (quoting People v.&para;<br>Chiagles, 237 N. Y. 193, 197, 142 N. E. 583, 584 (1923));&para;<br>see also 414 U. S., at 237 (Powell, J., concurring) (“an&para;<br>individual lawfully subjected to a custodial arrest retains&para;<br>no significant Fourth Amendment interest in the privacy&para;<br>of his person”). Put simply, a patdown of Robinson’s cloth-&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ing and an inspection of the cigarette pack found in his&para;<br>pocket constituted only minor additional intrusions compared to the substantial government authority exercised&para;<br>in taking Robinson into custody. See Chadwick, 433 U. S.,&para;<br>at 16, n. 10 (searches of a person are justified in part by&para;<br>“reduced expectations of privacy caused by the arrest”).&para;<br>The fact that an arrestee has diminished privacy interests does not mean that the Fourth Amendment falls out&para;<br>of the picture entirely. Not every search “is acceptable&para;<br>solely because a person is in custody.” Maryland v. King,&para;<br>569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 26). To the contrary,&para;<br>when “privacy-related concerns are weighty enough” a&para;<br>“search may require a warrant, notwithstanding the diminished expectations of privacy of the arrestee.” Ibid.&para;<br>One such example, of course, is Chimel. Chimel refused to&para;<br>“characteriz[e] the invasion of privacy that results from a&para;<br>top-to-bottom search of a man’s house as ‘minor.’ ” 395&para;<br>U. S., at 766–767, n. 12. Because a search of the arrestee’s&para;<br>entire house was a substantial invasion beyond the arrest&para;<br>itself, the Court concluded that a warrant was required.&para;<br>Robinson is the only decision from this Court applying&para;<br>Chimel to a search of the contents of an item found on an&para;<br>arrestee’s person. In an earlier case, this Court had approved a search of a zipper bag carried by an arrestee, but&para;<br>the Court analyzed only the validity of the arrest itself.&para;<br>See Draper v. United States, 358 U. S. 307, 310–311&para;<br>(1959). Lower courts applying Robinson and Chimel,&para;<br>however, have approved searches of a variety of personal&para;<br>items carried by an arrestee. See, e.g., United States v.&para;<br>Carrion, 809 F. 2d 1120, 1123, 1128 (CA5 1987) (billfold&para;<br>and address book); United States v. Watson, 669 F. 2d&para;<br>1374, 1383–1384 (CA11 1982) (wallet); United States v.&para;<br>Lee, 501 F. 2d 890, 892 (CADC 1974) (purse).&para;<br>The United States asserts that a search of all data&para;<br>stored on a cell phone is “materially indistinguishable”&para;<br>from searches of these sorts of physical items.

That is like saying a&para;<br>ride on horseback is materially indistinguishable from a&para;<br>flight to the moon. Both are ways of getting from point A&para;<br>to point B, but little else justifies lumping them together.&para;<br>Modern cell phones, as a category, implicate privacy concerns far beyond those implicated by the search of a cigarette pack, a wallet, or a purse. A conclusion that inspecting the contents of an arrestee’s pockets works no&para;<br>substantial additional intrusion on privacy beyond the&para;<br>arrest itself may make sense as applied to physical items,&para;<br>but any extension of that reasoning to digital data has to&para;<br>rest on its own bottom.&para;<br>1&para;<br>Cell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualitative sense from other objects that might be kept on an&para;<br>arrestee’s person. The term “cell phone” is itself misleading shorthand; many of these devices are in fact minicomputers that also happen to have the capacity to be used as&para;<br>a telephone. They could just as easily be called cameras,&para;<br>video players, rolodexes, calendars, tape recorders, libraries, diaries, albums, televisions, maps, or newspapers.&para;<br>One of the most notable distinguishing features of modern cell phones is their immense storage capacity. Before&para;<br>cell phones, a search of a person was limited by physical&para;<br>realities and tended as a general matter to constitute only&para;<br>a narrow intrusion on privacy. See Kerr, Foreword: Accounting for Technological Change, 36 Harv. J. L. &amp; Pub.&para;<br>Pol’y 403, 404–405 (2013). Most people cannot lug around&para;<br>every piece of mail they have received for the past several&para;<br>months, every picture they have taken, or every book or&para;<br>article they have read—nor would they have any reason to&para;<br>attempt to do so. And if they did, they would have to drag&para;<br>behind them a trunk of the sort held to require a search&para;<br>warrant in Chadwick, supra, rather than a container the&para;<br>size of the cigarette package in Robinson.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>But the possible intrusion on privacy is not physically&para;<br>limited in the same way when it comes to cell phones. The&para;<br>current top-selling smart phone has a standard capacity of&para;<br>16 gigabytes (and is available with up to 64 gigabytes).&para;<br>Sixteen gigabytes translates to millions of pages of text,&para;<br>thousands of pictures, or hundreds of videos. See Kerr,&para;<br>supra, at 404; Brief for Center for Democracy &amp; Technology et al. as Amici Curiae 7–8. Cell phones couple that&para;<br>capacity with the ability to store many different types of&para;<br>information: Even the most basic phones that sell for less&para;<br>than $20 might hold photographs, picture messages, text&para;<br>messages, Internet browsing history, a calendar, a thousandentry phone book, and so on. See id., at 30; United States&para;<br>v. Flores-Lopez, 670 F. 3d 803, 806 (CA7 2012). We expect&para;<br>that the gulf between physical practicability and digital&para;<br>capacity will only continue to widen in the future.&para;<br>The storage capacity of cell phones has several interrelated consequences for privacy. First, a cell phone collects&para;<br>in one place many distinct types of information—an address, a note, a prescription, a bank statement, a video—&para;<br>that reveal much more in combination than any isolated&para;<br>record. Second, a cell phone’s capacity allows even just&para;<br>one type of information to convey far more than previously&para;<br>possible. The sum of an individual’s private life can be&para;<br>reconstructed through a thousand photographs labeled&para;<br>with dates, locations, and descriptions; the same cannot be&para;<br>said of a photograph or two of loved ones tucked into a&para;<br>wallet. Third, the data on a phone can date back to the&para;<br>purchase of the phone, or even earlier. A person might&para;<br>carry in his pocket a slip of paper reminding him to call&para;<br>Mr. Jones; he would not carry a record of all his communications with Mr. Jones for the past several months, as&para;<br>would routinely be kept on a phone.1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Because the United States and California agree that these cases&para;<br>involve searches incident to arrest, these cases do not implicate the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Finally, there is an element of pervasiveness that characterizes cell phones but not physical records. Prior to the&para;<br>digital age, people did not typically carry a cache of sensitive personal information with them as they went about&para;<br>their day. Now it is the person who is not carrying a cell&para;<br>phone, with all that it contains, who is the exception.&para;<br>According to one poll, nearly three-quarters of smart&para;<br>phone users report being within five feet of their phones&para;<br>most of the time, with 12% admitting that they even use&para;<br>their phones in the shower. See Harris Interactive, 2013&para;<br>Mobile Consumer Habits Study (June 2013). A decade ago&para;<br>police officers searching an arrestee might have occasionally stumbled across a highly personal item such as a&para;<br>diary. See, e.g., United States v. Frankenberry, 387 F. 2d&para;<br>337 (CA2 1967) (per curiam). But those discoveries were&para;<br>likely to be few and far between. Today, by contrast, it is&para;<br>no exaggeration to say that many of the more than 90% of&para;<br>American adults who own a cell phone keep on their person a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives—&para;<br>from the mundane to the intimate. See Ontario v. Quon,&para;<br>560 U. S. 746, 760 (2010). Allowing the police to scrutinize&para;<br>such records on a routine basis is quite different from&para;<br>allowing them to search a personal item or two in the&para;<br>occasional case.&para;<br>Although the data stored on a cell phone is distinguished from physical records by quantity alone, certain&para;<br>types of data are also qualitatively different. An Internet&para;<br>search and browsing history, for example, can be found on&para;<br>an Internet-enabled phone and could reveal an individual’s private interests or concerns—perhaps a search for&para;<br>certain symptoms of disease, coupled with frequent visits&para;<br>to WebMD. Data on a cell phone can also reveal where a&para;<br>person has been. Historic location information is a stand—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>question whether the collection or inspection of aggregated digital&para;<br>&para;<br>information amounts to a search under other circumstances.&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v.

Kirschenblatt, 16&para;<br>F. 2d 202, 203 (CA2). If his pockets contain a cell phone,&para;<br>however, that is no longer true. Indeed, a cell phone&para;<br>search would typically expose to the government far more&para;<br>than the most exhaustive search of a house: A phone not&para;<br>only contains in digital form many sensitive records previ-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

See New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 460,&para;<br>n. 4 (1981) (describing a “container” as “any object capable&para;<br>of holding another object”). But the analogy crumbles&para;<br>entirely when a cell phone is used to access data located&para;<br>elsewhere, at the tap of a screen. That is what cell&para;<br>phones, with increasing frequency, are designed to do by&para;<br>taking advantage of “cloud computing.” Cloud computing&para;<br>is the capacity of Internet-connected devices to display&para;<br>data stored on remote servers rather than on the device&para;<br>itself. Cell phone users often may not know whether&para;<br>particular information is stored on the device or in the&para;<br>cloud, and it generally makes little difference. See Brief&para;<br>for Electronic Privacy Information Center in No. 13–132,&para;<br>at 12–14, 20. Moreover, the same type of data may be&para;<br>stored locally on the device for one user and in the cloud&para;<br>for another.&para;<br>The United States concedes that the search incident to&para;<br>arrest exception may not be stretched to cover a search of&para;<br>files accessed remotely—that is, a search of files stored in&para;<br>the cloud. See Brief for United States in No. 13–212, at&para;<br>43–44. Such a search would be like finding a key in a&para;<br>suspect’s pocket and arguing that it allowed law enforcement to unlock and search a house. But officers searching&para;<br>a phone’s data would not typically know whether the&para;<br>information they are viewing was stored locally at the&para;<br>time of the arrest or has been pulled from the cloud.&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Although the Government recognizes the problem, its&para;<br>proposed solutions are unclear. It suggests that officers&para;<br>could disconnect a phone from the network before searching the device—the very solution whose feasibility it contested with respect to the threat of remote wiping. Compare Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 13–132, at 50–51, with Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. in No. 13–212, pp. 13–14. Alternatively, the&para;<br>Government proposes that law enforcement agencies&para;<br>“develop protocols to address” concerns raised by cloud&para;<br>computing. Reply Brief in No. 13–212, pp. 14–15. Probably a good idea, but the Founders did not fight a revolution&para;<br>to gain the right to government agency protocols. The&para;<br>possibility that a search might extend well beyond papers&para;<br>and effects in the physical proximity of an arrestee is yet&para;<br>another reason that the privacy interests here dwarf those&para;<br>in Robinson.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Apart from their arguments for a direct extension of&para;<br>Robinson, the United States and California offer various&para;<br>fallback options for permitting warrantless cell phone&para;<br>searches under certain circumstances. Each of the proposals is flawed and contravenes our general preference to&para;<br>provide clear guidance to law enforcement through categorical rules. “[I]f police are to have workable rules, the&para;<br>balancing of the competing interests . . . ‘must in large&para;<br>part be done on a categorical basis—not in an ad hoc, caseby-case fashion by individual police officers.’ ” Michigan v.&para;<br>Summers, 452 U. S. 692, 705, n. 19 (1981) (quoting Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200, 219–220 (1979) (White, J.,&para;<br>concurring)).&para;<br>The United States first proposes that the Gant standard&para;<br>be imported from the vehicle context, allowing a warrantless search of an arrestee’s cell phone whenever it is reasonable to believe that the phone contains evidence of the&para;<br>crime of arrest. But Gant relied on “circumstances unique&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>to the vehicle context” to endorse a search solely for the&para;<br>purpose of gathering evidence. 556 U. S., at 343. JUSTICE&para;<br>SCALIA’s Thornton opinion, on which Gant was based,&para;<br>explained that those unique circumstances are “a reduced&para;<br>expectation of privacy” and “heightened law enforcement&para;<br>needs” when it comes to motor vehicles. 541 U. S., at 631;&para;<br>see also Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S., at 303–304. For&para;<br>reasons that we have explained, cell phone searches bear&para;<br>neither of those characteristics.&para;<br>At any rate, a Gant standard would prove no practical&para;<br>limit at all when it comes to cell phone searches. In the&para;<br>vehicle context, Gant generally protects against searches&para;<br>for evidence of past crimes. See 3 W. LaFave, Search and&para;<br>Seizure §7.1(d), at 709, and n. 191. In the cell phone&para;<br>context, however, it is reasonable to expect that incriminating information will be found on a phone regardless of&para;<br>when the crime occurred. Similarly, in the vehicle context&para;<br>Gant restricts broad searches resulting from minor crimes&para;<br>such as traffic violations. See id., §7.1(d), at 713, and n.&para;<br>204. That would not necessarily be true for cell phones. It&para;<br>would be a particularly inexperienced or unimaginative&para;<br>law enforcement officer who could not come up with several reasons to suppose evidence of just about any crime&para;<br>could be found on a cell phone. Even an individual pulled&para;<br>over for something as basic as speeding might well have&para;<br>locational data dispositive of guilt on his phone. An individual pulled over for reckless driving might have evidence on the phone that shows whether he was texting&para;<br>while driving. The sources of potential pertinent information are virtually unlimited, so applying the Gant&para;<br>standard to cell phones would in effect give “police officers&para;<br>unbridled discretion to rummage at will among a person’s&para;<br>private effects.” 556 U. S., at 345.&para;<br>The United States also proposes a rule that would restrict the scope of a cell phone search to those areas of the&para;<br>phone where an officer reasonably believes that infor-&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>mation relevant to the crime, the arrestee’s identity, or&para;<br>officer safety will be discovered. See Brief for United&para;<br>States in No. 13–212, at 51–53. This approach would&para;<br>again impose few meaningful constraints on officers. The&para;<br>proposed categories would sweep in a great deal of information, and officers would not always be able to discern in&para;<br>advance what information would be found where.&para;<br>We also reject the United States’ final suggestion that&para;<br>officers should always be able to search a phone’s call log,&para;<br>as they did in Wurie’s case. The Government relies on&para;<br>Smith v. Maryland, 442 U. S. 735 (1979), which held that&para;<br>no warrant was required to use a pen register at telephone&para;<br>company premises to identify numbers dialed by a particular caller. The Court in that case, however, concluded that&para;<br>the use of a pen register was not a “search” at all under&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment. See id., at 745–746. There is no&para;<br>dispute here that the officers engaged in a search of&para;<br>Wurie’s cell phone. Moreover, call logs typically contain&para;<br>more than just phone numbers; they include any identifying information that an individual might add, such as the&para;<br>label “my house” in Wurie’s case.&para;<br>Finally, at oral argument California suggested a different limiting principle, under which officers could search&para;<br>cell phone data if they could have obtained the same information from a pre-digital counterpart. See Tr. of Oral&para;<br>Arg. in No. 13–132, at 38–43; see also Flores-Lopez, 670&para;<br>F. 3d, at 807 (“If police are entitled to open a pocket diary&para;<br>to copy the owner’s address, they should be entitled to&para;<br>turn on a cell phone to learn its number.”). But the fact&para;<br>that a search in the pre-digital era could have turned up a&para;<br>photograph or two in a wallet does not justify a search of&para;<br>thousands of photos in a digital gallery. The fact that&para;<br>someone could have tucked a paper bank statement in a&para;<br>pocket does not justify a search of every bank statement&para;<br>from the last five years. And to make matters worse, such&para;<br>an analogue test would allow law enforcement to search a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>range of items contained on a phone, even though people&para;<br>would be unlikely to carry such a variety of information in&para;<br>physical form. In Riley’s case, for example, it is implausible that he would have strolled around with video tapes,&para;<br>photo albums, and an address book all crammed into his&para;<br>pockets. But because each of those items has a pre-digital&para;<br>analogue, police under California’s proposal would be able&para;<br>to search a phone for all of those items—a significant&para;<br>diminution of privacy.&para;<br>In addition, an analogue test would launch courts on a&para;<br>difficult line-drawing expedition to determine which digital files are comparable to physical records. Is an e-mail&para;<br>equivalent to a letter? Is a voicemail equivalent to a&para;<br>phone message slip? It is not clear how officers could&para;<br>make these kinds of decisions before conducting a search,&para;<br>or how courts would apply the proposed rule after the fact.&para;<br>An analogue test would “keep defendants and judges&para;<br>guessing for years to come.” Sykes v. United States, 564&para;<br>U.

Privacy comes at&para;<br>a cost.&para;<br>Our holding, of course, is not that the information on a&para;<br>cell phone is immune from search; it is instead that a&para;<br>warrant is generally required before such a search, even&para;<br>when a cell phone is seized incident to arrest. Our cases&para;<br>have historically recognized that the warrant requirement&para;<br>is “an important working part of our machinery of gov-&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v.

New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443, 481 (1971). Recent&para;<br>technological advances similar to those discussed here&para;<br>have, in addition, made the process of obtaining a warrant&para;<br>itself more efficient. See McNeely, 569 U.

The&para;<br>defendants here recognize—indeed, they stress—that such&para;<br>fact-specific threats may justify a warrantless search of&para;<br>cell phone data. See Reply Brief in No. 13–132, at 8–9;&para;<br>Brief for Respondent in No. 13–212, at 30, 41. The critical&para;<br>point is that, unlike the search incident to arrest exception, the exigent circumstances exception requires a court&para;<br>to examine whether an emergency justified a warrantless&para;<br>search in each particular case. See McNeely, supra, at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 6).2&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Our cases have recognized that the Fourth Amendment&para;<br>was the founding generation’s response to the reviled&para;<br>“general warrants” and “writs of assistance” of the colonial&para;<br>era, which allowed British officers to rummage through&para;<br>homes in an unrestrained search for evidence of criminal&para;<br>activity. Opposition to such searches was in fact one of the&para;<br>driving forces behind the Revolution itself. In 1761, the&para;<br>patriot James Otis delivered a speech in Boston denouncing the use of writs of assistance.

Cf. ante, at 9. This rule antedates the adoption&para;<br>of the Fourth Amendment by at least a century. See T.&para;<br>Clancy, The Fourth Amendment: Its History and Interpretation 340 (2008); T. Taylor, Two Studies in Constitutional&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Interpretation 28 (1969); Amar, Fourth Amendment First&para;<br>Principles, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 757, 764 (1994). In Weeks v.&para;<br>United States, 232 U. S. 383, 392 (1914), we held that the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment did not disturb this rule. See also&para;<br>Taylor, supra, at 45; Stuntz, The Substantive Origins of&para;<br>Criminal Procedure, 105 Yale L. J. 393, 401 (1995) (“The&para;<br>power to search incident to arrest—a search of the arrested&para;<br>suspect’s person . . .—was well established in the mideighteenth century, and nothing in . . . the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment changed that”). And neither in Weeks nor in&para;<br>any of the authorities discussing the old common-law rule&para;<br>have I found any suggestion that it was based exclusively&para;<br>or primarily on the need to protect arresting officers or to&para;<br>prevent the destruction of evidence.&para;<br>On the contrary, when pre-Weeks authorities discussed&para;<br>the basis for the rule, what was mentioned was the need to&para;<br>obtain probative evidence. For example, an 1839 case&para;<br>stated that “it is clear, and beyond doubt, that . . . constables . . . are entitled, upon a lawful arrest by them of one&para;<br>charged with treason or felony, to take and detain property found in his possession which will form material evidence in his prosecution for that crime.” See Dillon v.&para;<br>O’Brien, 16 Cox Crim. Cas. 245, 249–251 (1887) (citing&para;<br>Regina, v. Frost, 9 Car. &amp; P. 129, 173 Eng. Rep. 771)). The&para;<br>court noted that the origins of that rule “deriv[e] from the&para;<br>interest which the State has in a person guilty (or reasonably believed to be guilty) of a crime being brought to&para;<br>justice, and in a prosecution, once commenced, being&para;<br>determined in due course of law.” 16 Cox Crim. Cas., at&para;<br>249–250. See also Holker v. Hennessey, 141 Mo. 527, 537–&para;<br>540, 42 S. W. 1090, 1093 (1897).&para;<br>Two 19th-century treatises that this Court has previously cited in connection with the origin of the searchincident-to-arrest rule, see Weeks, supra, at 392, suggest&para;<br>the same rationale. See F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading&para;<br>and Practice §60, p. 45 (8th ed. 1880) (“Those arresting a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

California, 395 U. S. 752&para;<br>(1969), a case that involved the lawfulness of a search of&para;<br>the scene of an arrest, not the person of an arrestee. As I&para;<br>have explained, Chimel’s reasoning is questionable, see&para;<br>Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. 332, 361–363 (2009) (ALITO, J.,&para;<br>dissenting), and I think it is a mistake to allow that reasoning to affect cases like these that concern the search of&para;<br>the person of arrestees.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Despite my view on the point discussed above, I agree&para;<br>that we should not mechanically apply the rule used in the&para;<br>predigital era to the search of a cell phone. Many cell&para;<br>phones now in use are capable of storing and accessing a&para;<br>quantity of information, some highly personal, that no&para;<br>person would ever have had on his person in hard-copy&para;<br>form. This calls for a new balancing of law enforcement&para;<br>and privacy interests.&para;<br>The Court strikes this balance in favor of privacy interests with respect to all cell phones and all information&para;<br>found in them, and this approach leads to anomalies. For&para;<br>example, the Court’s broad holding favors information in&para;<br>digital form over information in hard-copy form. Suppose&para;<br>that two suspects are arrested. Suspect number one has&para;<br>in his pocket a monthly bill for his land-line phone, and&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>his surface clothing but his body, luggage, and saddlebags would be&para;<br>&para;<br>searched”). &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>the bill lists an incriminating call to a long-distance number. He also has in his a wallet a few snapshots, and one&para;<br>of these is incriminating. Suspect number two has in his&para;<br>pocket a cell phone, the call log of which shows a call to&para;<br>the same incriminating number. In addition, a number of&para;<br>photos are stored in the memory of the cell phone, and one&para;<br>of these is incriminating. Under established law, the&para;<br>police may seize and examine the phone bill and the snapshots in the wallet without obtaining a warrant, but under&para;<br>the Court’s holding today, the information stored in the&para;<br>cell phone is out.&para;<br>While the Court’s approach leads to anomalies, I do not&para;<br>see a workable alternative. Law enforcement officers need&para;<br>clear rules regarding searches incident to arrest, and it&para;<br>would take many cases and many years for the courts to&para;<br>develop more nuanced rules. And during that time, the&para;<br>nature of the electronic devices that ordinary Americans&para;<br>carry on their persons would continue to change.&para;<br>II&para;<br>This brings me to my second point. While I agree with&para;<br>the holding of the Court, I would reconsider the question&para;<br>presented here if either Congress or state legislatures,&para;<br>after assessing the legitimate needs of law enforcement&para;<br>and the privacy interests of cell phone owners, enact legislation that draws reasonable distinctions based on categories of information or perhaps other variables.&para;<br>The regulation of electronic surveillance provides an&para;<br>instructive example. After this Court held that electronic&para;<br>surveillance constitutes a search even when no property&para;<br>interest is invaded, see Katz v. United States, 389 U. S.&para;<br>347, 353–359 (1967), Congress responded by enacting Title&para;<br>III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of&para;<br>1968, 82 Stat. 211. See also 18 U. S. C. §2510 et seq.&para;<br>Since that time, electronic surveillance has been governed&para;<br>primarily, not by decisions of this Court, but by the stat-&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>RILEY v. CALIFORNIA&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>ute, which authorizes but imposes detailed restrictions on&para;<br>electronic surveillance. See ibid.&para;<br>Modern cell phones are of great value for both lawful&para;<br>and unlawful purposes. They can be used in committing&para;<br>many serious crimes, and they present new and difficult&para;<br>law enforcement problems. See Brief for United States in&para;<br>No. 13–212, pp. 2–3. At the same time, because of the role&para;<br>that these devices have come to play in contemporary life,&para;<br>searching their contents implicates very sensitive privacy&para;<br>interests that this Court is poorly positioned to understand and evaluate. Many forms of modern technology are&para;<br>making it easier and easier for both government and&para;<br>private entities to amass a wealth of information about&para;<br>the lives of ordinary Americans, and at the same time,&para;<br>many ordinary Americans are choosing to make public&para;<br>much information that was seldom revealed to outsiders&para;<br>just a few decades ago.&para;<br>In light of these developments, it would be very unfortunate if privacy protection in the 21st century were left&para;<br>primarily to the federal courts using the blunt instrument&para;<br>of the Fourth Amendment. Legislatures, elected by the&para;<br>people, are in a better position than we are to assess and&para;<br>respond to the changes that have already occurred and&para;<br>those that almost certainly will take place in the future.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
