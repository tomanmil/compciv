FROMMERT ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–810.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued January 20, 2010—Decided April 21, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioners are Xerox Corporation’s pension plan (Plan) and the Plan’s&para;<br>current and former administrators (Plan Administrator). Respon&para;<br>dents are employees who left Xerox in the 1980’s, received lump-sum&para;<br>distributions of retirement benefits earned up to that point, and were&para;<br>later rehired. To account for the past distributions when calculating&para;<br>respondents’ current benefits, the Plan Administrator initially inter&para;<br>preted the Plan to call for an approach that has come to be known as&para;<br>the “phantom account” method. Respondents challenged that method&para;<br>in an action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of&para;<br>1974 (ERISA). The District Court granted summary judgment for&para;<br>the Plan, but the Second Circuit vacated and remanded. It held that&para;<br>the Plan Administrator’s interpretation was unreasonable and that&para;<br>respondents had not received adequate notice that the phantom ac&para;<br>count method would be used to calculate their benefits. On remand,&para;<br>the Plan Administrator proposed a new interpretation of the Plan&para;<br>that accounted for the time value of the money respondents had pre&para;<br>viously received. The District Court declined to apply a deferential&para;<br>standard to this interpretation, and adopted instead an approach&para;<br>proposed by respondents that did not account for the time value of&para;<br>money. Affirming in relevant part, the Second Circuit held that the&para;<br>District Court was correct not to apply a deferential standard on re&para;<br>mand, and that the District Court’s decision on the merits was not an&para;<br>abuse of discretion.&para;<br>Held: The District Court should have applied a deferential standard of&para;<br>review to the Plan Administrator’s interpretation of the Plan on re&para;<br>mand. Pp. 4–15.&para;<br>(a) This Court addressed the standard for reviewing the decisions&para;<br>of ERISA plan administrators in Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Bruch, 489 U. S. 101. Firestone looked to “principles of trust law” for&para;<br>guidance. Id., at 111. Under trust law, the appropriate standard de&para;<br>pends on the language of the instrument creating the trust. When a&para;<br>trust instrument gives the trustee “power to construe disputed or&para;<br>doubtful terms, . . . the trustee’s interpretation will not be disturbed&para;<br>if reasonable.” Ibid. Under Firestone and the Plan’s terms, the Plan&para;<br>Administrator here would normally be entitled to deference when in&para;<br>terpreting the Plan. The Court of Appeals, however, crafted an ex&para;<br>ception to Firestone deference, holding that a court need not apply a&para;<br>deferential standard when a plan administrator’s previous construc&para;<br>tion of the same plan terms was found to violate ERISA. Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(b) The Second Circuit’s “one-strike-and-you’re-out” approach has&para;<br>no basis in Firestone, which set out a broad standard of deference&para;<br>with no suggestion that it was susceptible to ad hoc exceptions. This&para;<br>Court held in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___, ___,&para;<br>that a plan administrator operating under a systemic conflict of in&para;<br>terest is nonetheless still entitled to deferential review. In light of&para;<br>that ruling, it is difficult to see why a single honest mistake should&para;<br>require a different result. Nor is the Second Circuit’s decision sup&para;<br>ported by the considerations on which Firestone and Glenn were&para;<br>based—the plan’s terms, trust law principles, and ERISA’s purposes.&para;<br>The Plan grants the Plan Administrator general interpretive author&para;<br>ity without suggesting that the authority is limited to first efforts to&para;<br>construe the Plan. An exception to Firestone deference is also not re&para;<br>quired by trust law principles, which serve as a guide under ERISA&para;<br>but do not “tell the entire story.” Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489,&para;<br>497. Trust law does not resolve the specific question whether courts&para;<br>may strip a plan administrator of Firestone deference after one good&para;<br>faith mistake, but the guiding principles underlying ERISA do.&para;<br>ERISA represents a “ ‘careful balancing’ between ensuring fair and&para;<br>prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the encouragement of&para;<br>the creation of such plans.” Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U. S.&para;<br>200, 215. Firestone deference preserves this “careful balancing” and&para;<br>protects the statute’s interests in efficiency, predictability, and uni&para;<br>formity. Respondents claim that deference is less important once a&para;<br>plan administrator’s interpretation has been found unreasonable, but&para;<br>the interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniformity do not sud&para;<br>denly disappear simply because of a single honest mistake, as illus&para;<br>trated by this case. When the District Court declined to apply a def&para;<br>erential standard of review on remand, the court made the case more&para;<br>complicated than necessary. Respondents’ approach threatens to in&para;<br>terject additional issues into ERISA litigation that “would create fur&para;<br>ther complexity, adding time and expense to a process that may al&para;<br>ready be too costly for many [seeking] redress.” Glenn, supra, at ___.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>This case also demonstrates the harm to predictability and uniform&para;<br>ity that would result from stripping a plan administrator of Firestone&para;<br>deference. The District Court’s interpretation does not account for&para;<br>the time value of money, but respondents’ own actuarial expert testi&para;<br>fied that fairness required recognizing that principle. Respondents&para;<br>do not dispute that the District Court’s approach would place them in&para;<br>a better position than employees who never left the company. If&para;<br>other courts construed the Plan to account for the time value of&para;<br>money, moreover, Xerox could be placed in an impossible situation in&para;<br>which the Plan is subject to different interpretations and obligations&para;<br>in different States. Pp. 5–13.&para;<br>(c) Respondents claim that plan administrators will adopt unrea&para;<br>sonable interpretations of their plans seriatim, receiving deference&para;<br>each time, thereby undermining the prompt resolution of benefit dis&para;<br>putes, driving up litigation costs, and discouraging employees from&para;<br>challenging administrators’ decisions. These concerns are overblown&para;<br>because there is no reason to think that deference would be required&para;<br>in the extreme circumstances that respondents foresee. Multiple er&para;<br>roneous interpretations of the same plan provision, even if issued in&para;<br>good faith, could support a finding that a plan administrator is too&para;<br>incompetent to exercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds&para;<br>of costly litigation that respondents fear. Applying a deferential&para;<br>standard of review also does not mean that the plan administrator&para;<br>will always prevail on the merits. It means only that the plan admin&para;<br>istrator’s interpretation “will not be disturbed if reasonable.” Fire&para;<br>stone, 489 U. S., at 111.

Even administrators of ERISA&para;<br>plans. That should come as no surprise, given that the&para;<br>Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is “an&para;<br>enormously complex and detailed statute,” Mertens v.&para;<br>Hewitt Associates, 508 U.

We held in Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.&para;<br>Bruch, 489 U.

The&para;<br>question here is whether a single honest mistake in plan&para;<br>interpretation justifies stripping the administrator of that&para;<br>deference for subsequent related interpretations of the&para;<br>plan. We hold that it does not.&para;<br>I&para;<br>As in many ERISA matters, the facts of this case are&para;<br>exceedingly complicated. Fortunately, most of the factual&para;<br>details are unnecessary to the legal issues before us, so we&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>cover them only in broad strokes. This case concerns&para;<br>Xerox Corporation’s pension plan, which is covered by&para;<br>ERISA, 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U. S. C. §1001 et seq.&para;<br>Petitioners are the plan itself (hereinafter Plan), and the&para;<br>Plan’s current and former administrators (hereinafter&para;<br>Plan Administrator). See §1002(16)(A)(i); App. 32a. Re&para;<br>spondents are Xerox employees who left the company in&para;<br>the 1980’s, received lump-sum distributions of retirement&para;<br>benefits they had earned up to that point, and were later&para;<br>rehired. See 328 F. Supp. 2d 420, 424 (WDNY 2004); Brief&para;<br>for Respondents 9–10. The dispute giving rise to this case&para;<br>concerns how to account for respondents’ past distribu&para;<br>tions when calculating their current benefits—that is, how&para;<br>to avoid paying respondents the same benefits twice.&para;<br>The Plan Administrator initially interpreted the Plan to&para;<br>call for an approach that has come to be known as the&para;<br>“phantom account” method. 328 F. Supp. 2d, at 424.&para;<br>Essentially, that method calculated the hypothetical&para;<br>growth that respondents’ past distributions would have&para;<br>experienced if the money had remained in Xerox’s invest&para;<br>ment funds, and reduced respondents’ present benefits&para;<br>accordingly. See id., at 426–428; App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>146a. After the Plan Administrator denied respondents’&para;<br>administrative challenges to that method, respondents&para;<br>filed suit in federal court under ERISA, 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1132(a)(1)(B). See 328 F. Supp. 2d, at 428–429. The&para;<br>District Court granted summary judgment for the Plan,&para;<br>applying a deferential standard of review to the Plan&para;<br>Administrator’s interpretation. See id., at 430–431, 439.&para;<br>The Second Circuit vacated and remanded, holding that&para;<br>the Plan Administrator’s interpretation was unreasonable&para;<br>and that respondents had not been adequately notified&para;<br>that the phantom account method would be used to calcu&para;<br>late their benefits. See 433 F. 3d 254, 257, 265–269&para;<br>(2006).&para;<br>The phantom account method having been exorcised&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>from the Plan, the District Court on remand considered&para;<br>other approaches for adjusting respondents’ present bene&para;<br>fits in light of their past distributions. See 472 F. Supp.&para;<br>2d 452, 456–458 (WDNY 2007). The Plan Administrator&para;<br>submitted an affidavit proposing an approach that, like&para;<br>the phantom account method, accounted for the time value&para;<br>of the money that respondents had previously received.&para;<br>But unlike the phantom account method, the Plan Admin&para;<br>istrator’s new approach did not calculate the present value&para;<br>of a past distribution based on events that occurred after&para;<br>the distribution was made. Instead, the new approach&para;<br>used an interest rate that was fixed at the time of the&para;<br>distribution, thereby calculating the current value of the&para;<br>distribution based on information that was known at the&para;<br>time of the distribution. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 147a–&para;<br>153a. Petitioners argued that the District Court should&para;<br>apply a deferential standard of review to this approach,&para;<br>and accept it as a reasonable interpretation of the Plan.&para;<br>See Defendants’ Pre-Hearing Brief Addressed to Remedies&para;<br>in No. 00–CV–6311 (WDNY), pp. 7–8; Defendants’ PreHearing Reply Brief Addressing Remedies in No. 00–CV–&para;<br>6311 (WDNY), p. 2.&para;<br>The District Court did not apply a deferential standard&para;<br>of review. Nor did it accept the Plan Administrator’s&para;<br>interpretation. Instead, after finding the Plan to be am&para;<br>biguous, the District Court adopted an approach proposed&para;<br>by respondents that did not account for the time value of&para;<br>money. Under that approach, respondents’ present bene&para;<br>fits were reduced only by the nominal amount of their past&para;<br>distributions—thereby treating a dollar distributed to&para;<br>respondents in the 1980’s as equal in value to a dollar&para;<br>distributed today. See 472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457–458. The&para;<br>Second Circuit affirmed in relevant part, holding that the&para;<br>District Court was correct not to apply a deferential stan&para;<br>dard on remand, and that the District Court’s decision on&para;<br>the merits was not an abuse of discretion. See 535 F. 3d&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>111, 119 (2008).&para;<br>Petitioners asked us to grant certiorari on two ques&para;<br>tions: (1) whether the District Court owed deference to the&para;<br>Plan Administrator’s interpretation of the Plan on re&para;<br>mand, and (2) whether the Court of Appeals properly&para;<br>granted deference to the District Court on the merits. Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. i. We granted certiorari on both, 557 U. S. ___&para;<br>(2009), but find it necessary to decide only the first.&para;<br>II&para;<br>A&para;<br>This Court addressed the standard for reviewing the&para;<br>decisions of ERISA plan administrators in Firestone, 489&para;<br>U. S. 101. Because ERISA’s text does not directly resolve&para;<br>the matter, we looked to “principles of trust law” for guid&para;<br>ance. Id., at 109, 111. We recognized that, under trust&para;<br>law, the proper standard of review of a trustee’s decision&para;<br>depends on the language of the instrument creating the&para;<br>trust. See id., at 111–112. If the trust documents give the&para;<br>trustee “power to construe disputed or doubtful terms, . . .&para;<br>the trustee’s interpretation will not be disturbed if reason&para;<br>able.” Id., at 111. Based on these considerations, we held&para;<br>that “a denial of benefits challenged under §1132(a)(1)(B)&para;<br>is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the&para;<br>benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discre&para;<br>tionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to&para;<br>construe the terms of the plan.” Id., at 115.&para;<br>We expanded Firestone’s approach in Metropolitan Life&para;<br>Ins. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U. S. ___ (2008). In determining the&para;<br>proper standard of review when a plan administrator&para;<br>operates under a conflict of interest, we again looked to&para;<br>trust law, the terms of the plan at issue, and the principles&para;<br>of ERISA—plus, of course, our precedent in Firestone. See&para;<br>554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4, 6–7, 9–10). We held that,&para;<br>when the terms of a plan grant discretionary authority to&para;<br>the plan administrator, a deferential standard of review&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>remains appropriate even in the face of a conflict. See id.,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 9).&para;<br>It is undisputed that, under Firestone and the terms of&para;<br>the Plan, the Plan Administrator here would normally be&para;<br>entitled to deference when interpreting the Plan. See 328&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d, at 430–431 (observing that the Plan grants&para;<br>the Plan Administrator “broad discretion in making deci&para;<br>sions relative to the Plan”). The Court of Appeals, how&para;<br>ever, crafted an exception to Firestone deference. Specifi&para;<br>cally, the Second Circuit held that a court need not apply a&para;<br>deferential standard “where the administrator ha[s] previ&para;<br>ously construed the same [plan] terms and we found such&para;<br>a construction to have violated ERISA.” 535 F. 3d, at 119.&para;<br>Under that view, the District Court here was entitled to&para;<br>reject a reasonable interpretation of the Plan offered by&para;<br>the Plan Administrator, solely because the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals had overturned a previous interpretation by&para;<br>the Administrator.&para;<br>Cf. ibid. (accepting the District&para;<br>Court’s chosen method as one of “several reasonable&para;<br>alternatives”).&para;<br>B&para;<br>We reject this “one-strike-and-you’re-out” approach.&para;<br>Brief for Petitioners 51. As an initial matter, it has no&para;<br>basis in the Court’s holding in Firestone, which set out a&para;<br>broad standard of deference without any suggestion that&para;<br>the standard was susceptible to ad hoc exceptions like the&para;<br>one adopted by the Court of Appeals. See 489 U. S., at&para;<br>111, 115. Indeed, we refused to create such an exception&para;<br>to Firestone deference in Glenn, recognizing that ERISA&para;<br>law was already complicated enough without adding&para;<br>“special procedural or evidentiary rules” to the mix. 554&para;<br>U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). If, as we held in Glenn, a&para;<br>systemic conflict of interest does not strip a plan adminis&para;<br>trator of deference, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 9), it is diffi&para;<br>cult to see why a single honest mistake would require a&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>different result.&para;<br>Nor is the Court of Appeals’ decision supported by the&para;<br>considerations on which our holdings in Firestone and&para;<br>Glenn were based—namely, the terms of the plan, princi&para;<br>ples of trust law, and the purposes of ERISA. See supra,&para;<br>at 4–5. First, the Plan here grants the Plan Administrator&para;<br>general authority to “[c]onstrue the Plan.” App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 141a–142a. Nothing in that provision suggests that&para;<br>the grant of authority is limited to first efforts to construe&para;<br>the Plan.&para;<br>Second, the Court of Appeals’ exception to Firestone&para;<br>deference is not required by principles of trust law. Trust&para;<br>law is unclear on the narrow question before us. A leading&para;<br>treatise states that a court will strip a trustee of his dis&para;<br>cretion when there is reason to believe that he will not&para;<br>exercise that discretion fairly—for example, upon a show&para;<br>ing that the trustee has already acted in bad faith:&para;<br>“If the trustee’s failure to pay a reasonable amount [to&para;<br>the beneficiary of the trust] is due to a failure to exer&para;<br>cise [the trustee’s] discretion honestly and fairly, the&para;<br>court may well fix the amount [to be paid] itself. On&para;<br>the other hand, if the trustee’s failure to provide rea&para;<br>sonably for the beneficiary is due to a mistake as to&para;<br>the trustee’s duties or powers, and there is no reason&para;<br>to believe the trustee will not fairly exercise the dis&para;<br>cretion once the court has determined the extent of&para;<br>the trustee’s duties and powers, the court ordinarily&para;<br>will not fix the amount but will instead direct the&para;<br>trustee to make reasonable provision for the benefici&para;<br>ary’s support.” 3 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, &amp; M. Ascher,&para;<br>Scott and Ascher on Trusts §18.2.1, pp. 1348–1349&para;<br>(5th ed. 2007) (hereinafter Scott and Ascher) (footnote&para;<br>omitted) (citing cases).&para;<br>This is not surprising—if the settlor who creates a trust&para;<br>grants discretion to the trustee, it seems doubtful that the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>settlor would want the trustee divested entirely of that&para;<br>discretion simply because of one good-faith mistake.1&para;<br>Here the lower courts made no finding that the Plan&para;<br>Administrator had acted in bad faith or would not fairly&para;<br>exercise his discretion to interpret the terms of the Plan.&para;<br>Thus, if the District Court had followed the trust law&para;<br>principles set out in Scott and Ascher, it should not have&para;<br>“act[ed] as a substitute trustee,” Eaton v.

There is&para;<br>still other authority for remanding the case to the&para;<br>trial court to hear evidence and fix the boundaries of a&para;<br>reasonable discretion to be exercised by the trustee&para;<br>within maximum and minimum limits.” State v.&para;<br>Rubion, 158 Tex. 43, 54–55, 308 S.

Here trust law does not&para;<br>resolve the specific issue before us, but the guiding princi&para;<br>ples we have identified underlying ERISA do.&para;<br>Congress enacted ERISA to ensure that employees&para;<br>would receive the benefits they had earned, but Congress&para;<br>did not require employers to establish benefit plans in the&para;<br>first place. Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, 517 U. S. 882, 887&para;<br>(1996). We have therefore recognized that ERISA repre&para;<br>sents a “ ‘careful balancing’ between ensuring fair and&para;<br>prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the en&para;<br>couragement of the creation of such plans.” Aetna Health&para;<br>Inc. v. Davila, 542 U. S. 200, 215 (2004) (quoting Pilot Life&para;<br>Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 54 (1987)). Congress&para;<br>sought “to create a system that is [not] so complex that&para;<br>administrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly dis&para;<br>courage employers from offering [ERISA] plans in the first&para;<br>place.” Varity Corp., supra, at 497. ERISA “induc[es]&para;<br>employers to offer benefits by assuring a predictable set of&para;<br>liabilities, under uniform standards of primary conduct&para;<br>and a uniform regime of ultimate remedial orders and&para;<br>awards when a violation has occurred.” Rush Prudential&para;<br>HMO, Inc. v.

Deference promotes efficiency by encouraging&para;<br>resolution of benefits disputes through internal adminis&para;<br>trative proceedings rather than costly litigation.

FROMMERT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>expertise of the plan administrator rather than worry&para;<br>about unexpected and inaccurate plan interpretations that&para;<br>might result from de novo judicial review. Moreover,&para;<br>Firestone deference serves the interest of uniformity,&para;<br>helping to avoid a patchwork of different interpretations of&para;<br>a plan, like the one here, that covers employees in differ&para;<br>ent jurisdictions—a result that “would introduce consider&para;<br>able inefficiencies in benefit program operation, which&para;<br>might lead those employers with existing plans to reduce&para;<br>benefits, and those without such plans to refrain from&para;<br>adopting them.” Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482&para;<br>U. S. 1, 11 (1987). Indeed, a group of prominent actuaries&para;<br>tells us that it is impossible even to determine whether an&para;<br>ERISA plan is solvent (a duty imposed on actuaries by&para;<br>federal law, see 29 U. S. C. §§1023(a)(4), (d)) if the plan is&para;<br>interpreted to mean different things in different places.&para;<br>See Brief for Chief Actuaries as Amici Curiae 5–11.&para;<br>Respondents and the United States as amicus curiae do&para;<br>not question that deference to plan administrators serves&para;<br>these important purposes. Rather, they argue that defer&para;<br>ence is less important once a plan administrator has is&para;<br>sued an interpretation of a plan found to be unreasonable.&para;<br>But the interests in efficiency, predictability, and uniform&para;<br>ity—and the manner in which they are promoted by defer&para;<br>ence to reasonable plan construction by administrators—&para;<br>do not suddenly disappear simply because a plan adminis&para;<br>trator has made a single honest mistake.&para;<br>This case illustrates the point. Consider first the inter&para;<br>est in efficiency, an interest that Xerox has pursued by&para;<br>granting the Plan Administrator authority to construe the&para;<br>Plan. On remand from the Court of Appeals, if the Dis&para;<br>trict Court had applied a deferential standard of review&para;<br>under Firestone, the question before it would have been&para;<br>whether the Plan Administrator’s interpretation of the&para;<br>Plan was reasonable. After answering that question, the&para;<br>case might well have been over. Instead, the District&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Court declined to defer, and therefore had to answer the&para;<br>more complicated question of how best to interpret the&para;<br>Plan.&para;<br>The prospect of increased litigation costs inherent in&para;<br>respondents’ approach does not end there. Under respon&para;<br>dents’ and the Government’s view, the question whether a&para;<br>deferential standard of review was required in this case&para;<br>turns on whether the Plan Administrator was interpreting&para;<br>the “same terms” or deciding the “same issue” on remand.&para;<br>See Brief for Respondents 43, 46–48, 53, and n. 13; Brief&para;<br>for United States as Amicus Curiae 13–15, 23. Whether&para;<br>that condition is satisfied will not always be clear. Indeed,&para;<br>petitioners dispute that question here, arguing that the&para;<br>Plan Administrator confronted an entirely new issue on&para;<br>remand—how to interpret the Plan, knowing that specific&para;<br>provisions requiring use of the phantom account method&para;<br>could not be applied to respondents due to a lack of notice.&para;<br>See Brief for Petitioners 50–51. Respondents would force&para;<br>the parties to litigate this potentially complicated “same&para;<br>issue” or “same terms” question before a district court&para;<br>could even decide whether deference is owed to a plan&para;<br>administrator’s view. As we recognized in Glenn, there is&para;<br>little place in the ERISA context for these sorts of “special&para;<br>procedural rules [that] would create further complexity,&para;<br>adding time and expense to a process that may already be&para;<br>too costly for many of those who seek redress.” 554 U. S.,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 10).&para;<br>The position of respondents and the Government could&para;<br>interject other additional issues into ERISA litigation. For&para;<br>example, even under their view, the District Court here&para;<br>could have granted deference to the Plan Administrator;&para;<br>the court merely was not required to do so. See Brief for&para;<br>Respondents 43, 49–50, 52–53; Brief for United States as&para;<br>Amicus Curiae 23–24. That raises the question of how a&para;<br>court is to decide between the two options; respondents’&para;<br>answer is to weigh an indeterminate number of factors,&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>which would only further complicate ERISA proceedings.&para;<br>See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34, 40–45.&para;<br>This case also demonstrates the harm to the interest in&para;<br>predictability that would result from stripping a plan&para;<br>administrator of Firestone deference. After declining to&para;<br>apply a deferential standard here, the District Court&para;<br>adopted an interpretation of the Plan that does not ac&para;<br>count for the time value of money. 472 F. Supp. 2d, at&para;<br>458; 535 F. 3d, at 119. In the actuarial world, this is&para;<br>heresy, and highly unforeseeable. Indeed, the actuaries&para;<br>tell us that they have never encountered an ERISA plan&para;<br>resembling this one that did not include some adjustment&para;<br>for the time value of money. Brief for Chief Actuaries as&para;<br>Amici Curiae 12.&para;<br>Respondents’ own actuarial expert testified before the&para;<br>District Court that fairness would require recognizing the&para;<br>time value of money in some fashion. See App. 127a,&para;<br>130a. And respondents and the Government do not dis&para;<br>pute that the District Court’s approach, which does not&para;<br>account for the fact that respondents were able to use&para;<br>their past distributions as they saw fit for over 20 years,&para;<br>would place respondents in a better position than employ&para;<br>ees who never left the company. Cf. Brief for Respondents&para;<br>42–43; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 32–33.&para;<br>Deference to plan administrators, who have a duty to all&para;<br>beneficiaries to preserve limited plan assets, see Varity&para;<br>Corp., 516 U. S., at 514, helps prevent such windfalls for&para;<br>particular employees.&para;<br>Finally, this case demonstrates the uniformity problems&para;<br>that arise from creating ad hoc exceptions to Firestone&para;<br>deference. If other courts were to adopt an interpretation&para;<br>of the Plan that does account for the time value of money,&para;<br>Xerox could be placed in an impossible situation. Similar&para;<br>Xerox employees could be entitled to different benefits&para;<br>depending on where they live, or perhaps where they bring&para;<br>a legal action. Cf. 29 U. S. C. §1132(e)(2) (permitting suit&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

In&para;<br>fact, that may already be the case. In similar litigation&para;<br>over the Plan, the Ninth Circuit also rejected the use of&para;<br>the phantom account method, but held that the Plan&para;<br>Administrator should utilize actuarial principles in ac&para;<br>counting for rehired employees’ past distributions—which&para;<br>would presumably include taking some cognizance of the&para;<br>time value of money. See Miller v. Xerox Corp.

Thus, failing to defer to&para;<br>the Plan Administrator here could well cause the Plan to&para;<br>be subject to different interpretations in California and&para;<br>New York. “Uniformity is impossible, however, if plans&para;<br>are subject to different legal obligations in different&para;<br>States.” Egelhoff v.

Pilot Life Ins. Co., 481 U. S., at 54.&para;<br>C&para;<br>In spite of all this, respondents and the Government&para;<br>argue that requiring the District Court to apply Firestone&para;<br>deference in this case would actually disserve the purposes&para;<br>of ERISA. They argue that continued deference would&para;<br>encourage plan administrators to adopt unreasonable&para;<br>interpretations of plans in the first instance, as adminis&para;<br>trators would anticipate a second chance to interpret their&para;<br>plans if their first interpretations were rejected. And they&para;<br>argue that plan administrators would be able to proceed&para;<br>seriatim through several interpretations of their plans,&para;<br>each time receiving deference, thereby undermining the&para;<br>prompt resolution of disputes over benefits, driving up&para;<br>litigation costs, and discouraging employees from chal&para;<br>lenging the decisions of plan administrators at all.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>All this is overblown. There is no reason to think that&para;<br>deference would be required in the extreme circumstances&para;<br>that respondents foresee. Under trust law, a trustee may&para;<br>be stripped of deference when he does not exercise his&para;<br>discretion “honestly and fairly.” 3 Scott and Ascher 1348.&para;<br>Multiple erroneous interpretations of the same plan provi&para;<br>sion, even if issued in good faith, might well support a&para;<br>finding that a plan administrator is too incompetent to&para;<br>exercise his discretion fairly, cutting short the rounds of&para;<br>costly litigation that respondents fear.&para;<br>Applying a deferential standard of review does not mean&para;<br>that the plan administrator will prevail on the merits. It&para;<br>means only that the plan administrator’s interpretation of&para;<br>the plan “will not be disturbed if reasonable.” Firestone,&para;<br>489 U. S., at 111; see also ibid.

To explain my view, I shall describe the&para;<br>three significant mistakes involved in this case.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The first mistake is that of Xerox Corporation’s pension&para;<br>plan (Plan) and its administrators (collectively, Plan&para;<br>Administrator), petitioners here. The Plan, as I under­&para;<br>stand it, pays employees the highest of three benefits upon&para;<br>retirement. App. 29a–31a. These benefits are calculated&para;<br>as follows (I simplify and use my own words, not those of&para;<br>the Plan):&para;<br>(1) “The Pension”: Take your average salary for your&para;<br>five highest salary years at Xerox; multiply by 1.4 per­&para;<br>cent; and multiply again by the number of years you&para;<br>worked at Xerox (up to 30). Id., at 7a–11a, 29a–30a.&para;<br>Thus, if the average salary of your five highest paid&para;<br>years was $50,000 and you worked at Xerox for 30&para;<br>years, you would be entitled to receive $21,000 per&para;<br>year ($50,000 × 1.4 percent × 30).&para;<br>(2) “The Cash Account”: Every year, Xerox credits 5&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>percent of your salary to a cash account. Id., at 40a.&para;<br>This account accrues interest at a yearly fixed rate 1&para;<br>percent above the 1-year Treasury bill rate. Id., at&para;<br>41a. To determine your benefits under this approach,&para;<br>take the balance of your cash account and convert the&para;<br>final amount to an annuity. Id., at 31a. Thus, if you&para;<br>have accrued, say, $200,000 in your account and the&para;<br>relevant annuity rate at the time of your retirement is&para;<br>7 percent, you would be entitled to receive approxi­&para;<br>mately $14,000 per year upon your retirement (ap­&para;<br>proximately $200,000 ×7 percent).&para;<br>(3) “The Investment Account”: Before 1990, Xerox&para;<br>contributed to an employee profit sharing plan. Id., at&para;<br>33a–34a. Thus, all employees who were hired by the&para;<br>end of 1989 have an investment account that consists&para;<br>of all of the contributions Xerox made to this profit&para;<br>sharing plan (prior to its discontinuation) and the in­&para;<br>vestment returns on those contributions. Id., at 33a–&para;<br>36a. To determine your benefits under this approach,&para;<br>take the balance of your investment account and con­&para;<br>vert the final amount to an annuity. Id., at 31a.&para;<br>Thus, just like the cash account, if you have accrued&para;<br>$400,000 in your account and the relevant annuity&para;<br>rate at the time of your retirement is 7 percent, you&para;<br>would be entitled to receive approximately $28,000&para;<br>per year upon your retirement (approximately&para;<br>$400,000 × 7 percent).&para;<br>Given these three examples, the retiring employee’s pen­&para;<br>sion would come from the investment account, and the&para;<br>employee would receive $28,000 per year.&para;<br>This case concerns one aspect of Xerox’s retirement&para;<br>plan, namely, the way in which the Plan treats employees&para;<br>who leave Xerox and later return, working for additional&para;<br>years before their ultimate retirement. The Plan has long&para;<br>treated such leaving-and-returning employees as follows&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>(again, I simplify and use my own words):&para;<br>First, when an employee initially leaves, she is paid a&para;<br>lump-sum distribution equivalent to the benefits she has&para;<br>accrued up to that point (i.e., the highest of her pension,&para;<br>her cash account, or, if she was hired before the end of&para;<br>1989, her investment account). See ante, at 2.&para;<br>Second, when the employee returns, she again begins to&para;<br>accrue amounts in her cash account, App. 40a–41a, start­&para;<br>ing from scratch. (She accrues nothing in her investment&para;<br>account, because Xerox no longer makes profit sharing&para;<br>contributions. Id., at 34a.) Thus, by the time of her re­&para;<br>tirement the employee may not have accrued much money&para;<br>in this account.&para;<br>Third, a rehired employee’s pension is calculated in the&para;<br>way I have set forth above, with her entire tenure at Xerox&para;<br>(both before her departure and after her return) taken into&para;<br>account. See Brief for Petitioners 9–10.&para;<br>Fourth, the employee’s benefits calculation is adjusted&para;<br>to take account of the fact that the employee has already&para;<br>received a lump-sum distribution from the Plan. See App.&para;<br>32a; Brief for Petitioners 10–11.&para;<br>This case is about the adjustment that takes place dur­&para;<br>ing step four. It concerns the way in which the Plan Ad­&para;<br>ministrator calculates that adjustment so as to reflect the&para;<br>fact that a retiring leaving-and-returning employee has&para;<br>already received a distribution when she initially left&para;<br>Xerox. Before 1989, the Plan Administrator calculated the&para;<br>adjusted amount by taking the benefits distribution previ­&para;<br>ously received (say, $100,000) and adjusting it to equal the&para;<br>amount that would have existed in the investment account&para;<br>had no distribution been made. Ibid. Thus, if an employee&para;<br>had not left Xerox, and if the $100,000 had been left in her&para;<br>investment account for, say, 20 years, that amount would&para;<br>likely have increased dramatically—perhaps doubling,&para;<br>tripling, or quadrupling in amount, depending upon how&para;<br>well the Plan’s investments performed.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>It is this hypothetical sum—termed the “phantom ac­&para;<br>count,” ante, at 2—that is at issue in this case. Xerox’s&para;<br>pre-1989 Plan assumed that a rehired employee had this&para;<br>hypothetical sum on hand at the time of her final retire­&para;<br>ment from the company, and in effect subtracted the&para;<br>amount from the employee’s benefits upon her departure.&para;<br>Brief for Petitioners 10–11; cf. ante, at 2. Depending on&para;<br>how the Plan’s investments did over time, the Administra­&para;<br>tor’s use of this “phantom account” could have a substan­&para;<br>tial impact on a rehired employee’s benefits. (See Appen­&para;<br>dix, infra, for an example of how this “phantom account”&para;<br>works.)&para;<br>When the Plan Administrator amended Xerox’s Em­&para;<br>ployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)&para;<br>Plan in 1989, however, it made what it tells us was an&para;<br>“inadverten[t]” omission. Brief for Petitioners 11, n. 3. In&para;<br>a section of the 1989 Plan applicable to the roughly 100&para;<br>leaving-and-returning employees who are plaintiffs here,&para;<br>the Plan said that it would “offset” the retiring employees’&para;<br>“accrued benefit” (as ordinarily calculated) “by the accrued&para;<br>benefit attributable” to the prior lump-sum “distribution”&para;<br>those employees received when they initially left Xerox.&para;<br>App. 32a. But the Plan said nothing about how it would&para;<br>calculate this “offset.” In other words, the Plan said noth­&para;<br>ing about the Administrator’s use of the “phantom ac­&para;<br>count.”&para;<br>This led to the first mistake in this case. Despite the&para;<br>Plan’s failure to include language explaining how the&para;<br>Administrator would take into account an employee’s prior&para;<br>distribution, the Plan Administrator continued to employ&para;<br>the “phantom account” methodology. In essence, the&para;<br>Administrator read the 1989 Plan to include the language&para;<br>that had been omitted—an interpretation that, as de­&para;<br>scribed below, see Part I–B, infra, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>found to be arbitrary and capricious and in violation of&para;<br>ERISA.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

They pointed out&para;<br>that the 1989 Plan said that it would decrease their re­&para;<br>tirement benefits to reflect the fact that they had already&para;<br>received a lump-sum benefits distribution when they&para;<br>initially left Xerox. But, they added, neither the 1989&para;<br>Plan, nor the 1989 Plan’s Summary Plan Description, said&para;<br>anything about whether (or how) the Administrator would&para;<br>adjust their previous benefits distribution to take into&para;<br>account that they had received the distribution well before&para;<br>their retirement. They thus claimed that the Plan Admin­&para;<br>istrator could not use the “phantom account” methodology&para;<br>to adjust their previous distributions. See Brief for United&para;<br>States as Amicus Curiae 4–5.&para;<br>The District Court, however, rejected respondents’&para;<br>claims. 328 F. Supp. 2d 420 (WDNY 2004).

The Court of Appeals&para;<br>concluded that, because the 1989 Plan said nothing about&para;<br>how the Administrator would adjust the previous benefits&para;<br>distributions, it was “arbitrary and capricious” for the&para;<br>Administrator to interpret the 1989 Plan as if it still in­&para;<br>corporated the “phantom account.” Id., at 265–266, and&para;<br>n. 11.

FROMMERT&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>with fair notice that the Administrator was going to use&para;<br>the “phantom account” approach. See id., at 265 (discuss­&para;<br>ing 29 U. S. C. §1022); see also 433 F. 3d, at 263, 267–268&para;<br>(holding that the Administrator’s attempt to apply the&para;<br>“phantom account” to respondents violated two other&para;<br>ERISA provisions: 29 U. S. C. §1054(h)’s notice require­&para;<br>ment and §1054(g)’s prohibition on retroactive benefit&para;<br>cutbacks). Rather, the court noted, respondents “likely&para;<br>believed”—based on the language of the Plan—“that their&para;<br>past distributions would only be factored into their [cur­&para;<br>rent] benefits calculations by taking into account the&para;<br>amounts they had actually received.” 433 F. 3d, at 267.&para;<br>In light of these conclusions, the Court of Appeals rec­&para;<br>ognized the need to devise a remedy for the Administra­&para;<br>tor’s abuse of discretion and ERISA violations—a remedy&para;<br>that took into account the previous benefits distributions&para;<br>respondents had received in a manner consistent with the&para;<br>1989 Plan. The court therefore remanded the case to the&para;<br>District Court, with the following instructions:&para;<br>“On remand, the remedy crafted by the district court&para;<br>for those employees [in the respondents’ situation]&para;<br>should utilize an appropriate [pre-1989 Plan] calcula­&para;<br>tion to determine their benefits. We recognize the dif­&para;<br>ficulty that this task poses . . . . As guidance for the&para;<br>district court, we suggest that it may wish to employ&para;<br>equitable principles when determining the appropri­&para;<br>ate calculation and fashioning the appropriate rem­&para;<br>edy.” Id., at 268.&para;<br>On remand, the District Court invited the parties to&para;<br>submit remedial recommendations. Brief for Petitioners&para;<br>14. The Plan Administrator proposed an approach that&para;<br>would adjust respondents’ previous benefits distributions&para;<br>by adding interest, and, as a fallback, the Administrator&para;<br>suggested that the Plan should treat respondents as new&para;<br>hires.

The District Court rejected these suggestions and&para;<br>concluded that the “appropriate” remedy was the one&para;<br>suggested by the Second Circuit: no adjustment to the&para;<br>prior distributions received by respondents.&para;<br>472&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 452, 458 (WDNY 2007). The court stated that&para;<br>this remedy was “straightforward; it adequately pre­&para;<br>vent[ed] employees from receiving a windfall[;] and . . . it&para;<br>most clearly reflect[ed] what a reasonable employee would&para;<br>have anticipated based on the not-very-clear language in&para;<br>the Plan.” Ibid. And the Court of Appeals, finding that&para;<br>the District Court did not abuse its discretion in crafting a&para;<br>remedy, affirmed. 535 F. 3d 111 (CA2 2008).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The third mistake, I believe, is the Court’s.

Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489&para;<br>U. S. 101, 111–113 (1989); see also Metropolitan Life Ins.&para;<br>Co. v. Glenn, 554 U.

Central Transport, Inc., 472 U. S. 559, 570&para;<br>(1985). And, as the majority also recognizes, ante, at 4,&para;<br>where an ERISA plan grants an administrator the discre­&para;<br>tionary authority to interpret plan terms, trust law re&para;<br>quires a court to defer to the plan administrator’s inter­&para;<br>pretation of plan terms. See, e.g., Glenn, supra, at ____&para;<br>(slip op., at 4). But the majority further concludes that&para;<br>trust law “does not resolve the specific issue before” the&para;<br>Court in this case—i.e., whether a court is required to&para;<br>defer to an administrator’s second attempt at interpreting&para;<br>plan documents, even after the court has already deter­&para;<br>mined that the administrator’s first attempt amounted to&para;<br>an abuse of discretion. Ante, at 9. In my view, this final&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>conclusion is erroneous, as trust law imposes no such rigid&para;<br>and inflexible requirement.&para;<br>The Second Circuit found the Administrator’s interpre­&para;<br>tation of the Plan to be arbitrary and capricious and in&para;<br>violation of ERISA, and it made clear that the District&para;<br>Court’s task on remand was to “craf[t]” a “remedy.” See&para;<br>433 F. 3d, at 268. Trust law treatise writers say that in&para;<br>these circumstances a court may (but need not) exercise its&para;<br>own discretion rather than defer to a trustee’s interpreta­&para;<br>tion of trust language. See G. Bogert &amp; G. Bogert, Law of&para;<br>Trusts and Trustees §560, pp. 222–223 (2d rev. ed. 1980)&para;<br>(hereinafter Bogert &amp; Bogert) (after finding an abuse of&para;<br>discretion, a court may “decid[e] for the trustee how he&para;<br>should act,” possibly by “stating the exact result” the court&para;<br>“desires to achieve”); see also 2 Restatement (Third) of&para;<br>Trusts §50, p. 258 (2001) (hereinafter Third Restatement)&para;<br>(“A discretionary power conferred upon the trustee . . . is&para;<br>subject to judicial control only to prevent misinterpreta­&para;<br>tion or abuse of the discretion by the trustee”); 1 Restate­&para;<br>ment (Second) of Trusts §187, p. 402 (1957) (hereinafter&para;<br>Second Restatement) (“Where discretion is conferred upon&para;<br>the trustee . . . , its exercise is not subject to control by the&para;<br>court, except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his&para;<br>discretion”); see also Firestone, supra, at 111. Judges&para;<br>deciding trust law cases have said the same. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Colton v. Colton, 127 U.

In short, the controlling trust law princi­&para;<br>ple appears to be that, “[w]here the court finds that there&para;<br>has been an abuse of a discretionary power, the decree to&para;<br>be rendered is in its discretion.” Bogert &amp; Bogert §560, at&para;<br>222.&para;<br>Of course, the fact that trust law grants courts discre­&para;<br>tion does not mean that they will exercise that discretion&para;<br>in all instances. The majority refers to the 2007 edition of&para;<br>Scott on Trusts, ante, at 6, which says that, if there is “no&para;<br>reason” to doubt that a trustee “will . . . fairly exercise” his&para;<br>“discretion,” then courts “ordinarily will not fix the&para;<br>amount” of a payment “but will instead direct the trustee&para;<br>to make reasonable provision for the beneficiary’s sup­&para;<br>port,” 3 A. Scott, W. Fratcher, &amp; M. Ascher, Scott and&para;<br>Ascher on Trusts §18.2.1, pp. 1348–1349 (5th ed. 2007)&para;<br>(emphasis added). As this passage demonstrates, there&para;<br>are situations in which a court will typically defer to a&para;<br>trustee’s remedial suggestion.&para;<br>The word “ordinarily”&para;<br>confirms, however, that the Scott treatise writers recog­&para;<br>nize that there are instances in which courts will not&para;<br>defer. And other treatises indicate that black letter trust&para;<br>law gives the district courts authority to decide which&para;<br>instances are which. See Bogert &amp; Bogert §560, at 222–&para;<br>223 (when there is an abuse of discretion, a court “may set&para;<br>aside the transaction,” “award damages to the benefici­&para;<br>ary,” or “order a new decision to be made in the light of&para;<br>rules expounded by the court”); 2 Third Restatement §50,&para;<br>and Comment b, at 261 (discussing similar remedial op­&para;<br>tions); 1 Second Restatement §187, and Comment b, at&para;<br>402 (same); see also 3 Third Restatement §87, and Com­&para;<br>ment c, at 244–245 (noting that “judicial intervention on&para;<br>the ground of abuse” is allowed when a “good-faith,” yet&para;<br>“unreasonable,” decision is made by a trustee); Rubion,&para;<br>supra, at 54–55, 308 S.

FROMMERT&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Nevertheless, the majority reads the Scott treatise as&para;<br>establishing an absolute requirement that courts defer to&para;<br>a trustee’s fallback position absent “reason to believe that&para;<br>[the trustee] will not exercise [his] discretion fairly—for&para;<br>example, upon a showing that the trustee has already&para;<br>acted in bad faith.” Ante, at 6. And based on this reading,&para;<br>the majority further concludes that the existence of the&para;<br>Scott treatise creates uncertainty as to whether, under&para;<br>basic trust law principles, a court has the power to craft a&para;<br>remedy for a trustee’s abuse of discretion. Ante, at 6–9.&para;<br>It is unclear to me, however, why the majority reads the&para;<br>passage from Scott as creating a war among treatise writ­&para;<br>ers, compare ante, at 6 (discussing Scott) with ante, at 8&para;<br>(discussing Bogert), when the relevant passages can so&para;<br>easily be read as consistent with one another. I simply&para;<br>read the Scott treatise language as identifying circum­&para;<br>stances in which courts typically choose to defer to an&para;<br>administrator’s fallback position. The treatise does not&para;<br>suggest that the law forbids a court from acting on its own&para;<br>in the exercise of its broad remedial authority—authority&para;<br>that trust law plainly grants to supervising courts. See&para;<br>supra, at 8–9.&para;<br>A closer look at the Scott treatise confirms this under­&para;<br>standing. The treatise cites seven cases in support of the&para;<br>passage upon which the majority relies. See 3 Scott&para;<br>§18.2.1, at 1349, n. 4. Three of these cases explicitly state&para;<br>that a court may exercise its discretion to craft a remedy if&para;<br>a trustee has previously abused its discretion. See Old&para;<br>Colony Trust Co. v. Rodd, 356 Mass. 584, 589, 254 N. E.&para;<br>2d 886, 889 (1970) (“A court of equity may control a trus­&para;<br>tee in the exercise of a fiduciary discretion if it fails to&para;<br>observe standards of judgment apparent from the applica­&para;<br>ble instrument”); In re Marre’s Estate, 18 Cal. 2d 184, 190,&para;<br>114 P. 2d 586, 590–591 (1941) (“It is well settled that the&para;<br>courts will not attempt to exercise discretion which has&para;<br>been confided to a trustee unless it is clear that the trustee&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Three other cases are inapposite because&para;<br>their circumstances do not involve any allegation of abuse&para;<br>of discretion by the trustee. See In re Ziegler’s Trusts, 157&para;<br>So. 2d 549, 550 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1963) (per curiam)&para;<br>(“There is no contention here that the court . . . would not&para;<br>retain its rights, upon appropriate petition or other plead­&para;<br>ings by an interested party, to review an alleged abuse, if&para;<br>any, of the discretion exercised by the trustees”); In re&para;<br>Grubel’s Will, 37 Misc. 2d 910, 911, 235 N. Y. S. 2d 21, 23&para;<br>(Surr. Ct. 1962) (stating that “in the first instance” it is&para;<br>the “proper function of the trustees” to set an amount to be&para;<br>paid (emphasis added)); Orr v.

In the final case, the&para;<br>court decided that, on the facts before it, it did not need to&para;<br>control the trustees’ discretion. See Estate of Stillman,&para;<br>107 Misc. 2d 102, 111, 433 N. Y. S. 2d 701 (Surr. Ct. 1980)&para;<br>(“The fine record of the trustees in enhancing the equity of&para;<br>these trusts while earning substantial income, also per­&para;<br>suades the court of the wisdom of retaining their services&para;<br>as fiduciaries”). Which of these cases says that, after the&para;<br>trustee has abused its discretion, a district court must still&para;<br>defer to the trustee? None of them do. I repeat: Not a&para;<br>single case cited by the Scott treatise writers supports the&para;<br>majority’s reading of the treatise.&para;<br>The majority seeks to justify its reading of the Scott&para;<br>treatise by referring to four cases that Scott does not cite.&para;<br>See ante, at 7, n. 1. I am not surprised that the treatise&para;<br>does not refer to these cases. In the first three, a court&para;<br>thought it best, when a trustee had not yet exercised&para;<br>judgment about a particular matter, to direct the trustee&para;<br>to do so. See In re Sullivan’s Will, 144 Neb. 36, 40–41, 12&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>N. W. 2d 148, 150–151 (1943) (finding that the trustees’&para;<br>“failure to act” was erroneous, and directing the trustees&para;<br>to exercise their discretion in setting a payment amount);&para;<br>Eaton v. Eaton, 82 N. H. 216, 218, 132 A. 10, 11 (1926)&para;<br>(same); Finch v. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co., 156 N. C.&para;<br>App. 343, 347–348, 577 S. E. 2d 306, 309–310 (2003) (hold­&para;<br>ing trustee erred by “[f]ail[ing] to exercise judgment,” and&para;<br>directing it to do so). The fourth case concerns circum­&para;<br>stances so distant from those before us that it is difficult to&para;<br>know what to say. (The question was whether the benefi­&para;<br>ciary of a small trust had title in certain trust assets or&para;<br>whether the trustee had discretionary power to allocate&para;<br>them in her best interest; the court held the latter, adding&para;<br>that, if the trustee acted unreasonably, the lower court in&para;<br>that particular case should seek to have the trustee re­&para;<br>moved rather than trying to administer the trust funds&para;<br>itself.) See Hanford v. Clancy, 87 N. H. 458, 460–461, 183&para;<br>A. 271, 272–273 (1936).&para;<br>I cannot read these four cases, or any other case to&para;<br>which the majority refers, as holding that a court, as a&para;<br>general matter, is required to defer to a trust administra­&para;<br>tor’s second attempt at exercising discretion. And I am&para;<br>aware of no such case. In contrast, the Restatement and&para;<br>Bogert and Scott treatises identify numerous cases in&para;<br>which courts have remedied a trustee’s abuse of discretion&para;<br>by ordering the trustee to pay a specific amount. See 2&para;<br>Third Restatement §50, Reporter’s Note, at 283 (citing&para;<br>cases such as Coker v. Coker, 208 Ala. 354, 94 So. 566&para;<br>(1922)); Bogert &amp; Bogert §560, at 223, n. 19 (citing cases&para;<br>such as Rubion); 3 Scott §18.2.1, at 1348–1349, nn. 3–4&para;<br>(citing cases such as Emmert v.

E. 2d 236 (1978)); see also&para;<br>Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18 (listing cases).&para;<br>I thus do not find trust law “unclear” on this matter. Ante,&para;<br>at 6. When a trustee abuses its discretion, trust law&para;<br>grants courts the authority either to defer anew to the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>trustee’s discretion or to craft a remedy. See, e.g., 3 A.&para;<br>Scott &amp; W. Fratcher, Scott on Trusts §187, pp. 14–15 (4th&para;<br>ed. 1988) (“This ordinarily means that so long as [the&para;<br>trustee] acts not only in good faith and from proper mo­&para;<br>tives, but also within the bounds of reasonable judgment,&para;<br>the court will not interfere; but the court will interfere when he acts outside the bounds of a reasonable&para;<br>judgment”).&para;<br>Nor does anything in the present case suggest that the&para;<br>District Court abused its remedial authority. The Second&para;<br>Circuit stated that the interpretive problem on remand&para;<br>was in essence a remedial problem. See 433 F. 3d, at 268.&para;<br>It added that the remedial problem was “difficul[t]” and&para;<br>that “the district court . . . may wish to employ equitable&para;<br>principles when determining the appropriate calculation&para;<br>and fashioning the appropriate remedy.” Ibid. The Ad­&para;<br>ministrator had previously abused his discretionary&para;<br>power. Id., at 265–268. And the District Court found that&para;<br>the Administrator’s primary remedial suggestion on re­&para;<br>mand—adjusting respondents’ previous benefits distribu­&para;<br>tions by adding interest—probably would have violated&para;<br>ERISA’s notice provisions. 472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457. Under&para;<br>these circumstances, the District Court reasonably could&para;<br>have found a need to use its own remedial judgment,&para;<br>rather than rely on the Administrator’s—which is just&para;<br>what the Second Circuit said. 535 F. 3d, at 119.&para;<br>Moreover, even if the “narrow” trust law “question&para;<br>before us” were difficult, ante, at 6—which it is not—this&para;<br>difficulty would not excuse the Court from trying to do its&para;<br>best to work out a legal solution that nonetheless respects&para;<br>basic principles of trust law. “Congress invoked the com­&para;<br>mon law of trusts” in enacting ERISA, and this Court has&para;<br>thus repeatedly looked to trust law in order to determine&para;<br>“the particular duties and powers” of ERISA plan adminis­&para;<br>trators.

S., at 218–219; Firestone, 489&para;<br>U. S., at 111–113. While, as the majority recognizes, ante,&para;<br>at 8, trust law may “not tell the entire story,” Varity Corp.&para;<br>v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 497 (1996), I am aware of no other&para;<br>case in which this Court has simply ignored trust law (on&para;<br>the basis that it was unclear) and crafted a legal rule&para;<br>based on nothing but “the guiding principles we have&para;<br>identified underlying ERISA,” ante, at 9. See Varity,&para;<br>supra, at 497 (“In some instances, trust law will offer only&para;<br>a starting point, after which courts must go on to ask&para;<br>whether, or to what extent, the language of the statute, its&para;<br>structure, or its purposes require departing from common­&para;<br>law trust requirements” (emphasis added)).&para;<br>In any event, it is far from clear that the Court’s legal&para;<br>rule reflects an appropriate analysis of ERISA-based&para;<br>policy. To the contrary, the majority’s absolute “one free&para;<br>honest mistake” rule is impractical, for it requires courts&para;<br>to determine what is “honest,” encourages appeals on the&para;<br>point, and threatens to delay further proceedings that&para;<br>already take too long. (Respondents initially filed this&para;<br>retirement benefits case in 1999.) See Glenn, supra, at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 10). It also ignores what we previously have&para;<br>pointed out—namely, that abuses of discretion “arise in&para;<br>too many contexts” and “concern too many circumstances”&para;<br>for this Court “to come up with a one-size-fits-all proce­&para;<br>dural [approach] that is likely to promote fair and accu­&para;<br>rate” benefits determinations. Ibid. And, finally, the&para;<br>majority’s approach creates incentives for administrators&para;<br>to take “one free shot” at employer-favorable plan inter­&para;<br>pretations and to draft ambiguous retirement plans in the&para;<br>first instance with the expectation that they will have&para;<br>repeated opportunities to interpret (and possibly reinter­&para;<br>pret) the ambiguous terms. I thus fail to see how the&para;<br>majority’s “one free honest mistake” approach furthers&para;<br>ERISA’s core purpose of “promot[ing] the interests of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Co. v. Russell, 473 U.

See ante, at 9–&para;<br>13. But, in my view, these factors are, at the least, offset&para;<br>by the factors discussed above—e.g., discouraging admin­&para;<br>istrators from writing opaque plans and interpreting them&para;<br>aggressively—that argue to the contrary. At best, the&para;<br>policies at issue—some arguing in one direction, some the&para;<br>other—are far less able than trust law to provide a “guid­&para;<br>ing principle.” Thus, I conclude that here, as elsewhere,&para;<br>trust law ultimately provides the best way for courts to&para;<br>approach the administration and interpretation of ERISA.&para;<br>See, e.g., Firestone, supra, at 111–113. And trust law&para;<br>here, as I have said, leaves to the supervising court the&para;<br>decision as to how much weight to give to a plan adminis­&para;<br>trator’s remedial opinion.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Since the District Court was not required to defer to the&para;<br>Administrator’s fallback position, I should consider the&para;<br>second question presented, namely, whether the Court of&para;<br>Appeals properly reviewed the District Court’s decision&para;<br>under an “abuse of discretion” standard. Ante, at 4 (ac­&para;<br>knowledging, but not reaching, this issue). The answer to&para;<br>this question depends upon how one characterizes the&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Court of Appeals’ decision. If the court deferred to the&para;<br>District Court’s interpretation of Plan terms, then the&para;<br>Court of Appeals most likely should have reviewed the&para;<br>decision de novo. See Firestone, supra, at 112; cf. Davila,&para;<br>supra, at 210 (“Any dispute over the precise terms of the&para;<br>plan is resolved by a court under a de novo review stan­&para;<br>dard”). If instead the Court of Appeals deferred to the&para;<br>District Court’s creation of a remedy, in significant part on&para;<br>the basis of “equitable principles,” then it properly re­&para;<br>viewed the District Court decision for “abuse of discre­&para;<br>tion.” See, e.g., Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., 320&para;<br>F. 3d 11, 24 (CA1 2003); Zervos v. Verizon N. Y., Inc., 277&para;<br>F. 3d 635, 648 (CA2 2002); Grosz-Salomon v. Paul Revere&para;<br>Life Ins.

Grainger, Inc., 962 F. 2d 685, 697 (CA7 1992).&para;<br>The District Court opinion contains language that sup­&para;<br>ports either characterization. On the one hand, the court&para;<br>wrote that its task was to “interpret the Plan as written.”&para;<br>472 F. Supp. 2d, at 457. On the other hand, the court said&para;<br>that “virtually nothing is set forth in either the Plan or the&para;<br>[Summary Plan Description]” about how to treat prior&para;<br>distributions; and, in describing its task, it said that the&para;<br>Court of Appeals had directed it to use “equitable princi­&para;<br>ples” in fashioning a remedy. Ibid. Ultimately, the Dis­&para;<br>trict Court appears to have used both the Plan language&para;<br>and equitable principles to arrive at its conclusion. See&para;<br>id., at 457–459.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals, too, used language that supports&para;<br>both characterizations. Compare 535 F. 3d, at 117 (noting&para;<br>that the District Court “applied [Plan] terms” in crafting&para;<br>its remedy), with id., at 117–119 (describing the District&para;<br>Court’s decision as the “craft[ing]” of a “remedy” and&para;<br>acknowledging that it had directed the District Court to&para;<br>use “equitable principles” in doing so). But the Court of&para;<br>Appeals ultimately treated the District Court’s opinion as&para;<br>if it primarily created a fair remedy. Ibid. Given the prior&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Court of Appeals opinion’s language, supra, at 6 (quoting&para;<br>433 F. 3d, at 268), I believe that view is a fair, indeed a&para;<br>correct, view. And I consequently believe the Court of&para;<br>Appeals properly reviewed the result for an “abuse of&para;<br>discretion.”&para;<br>Petitioners argue that, because respondents were seek­&para;<br>ing relief under 29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(1)(B), the Court of&para;<br>Appeals was, in effect, prohibited from treating the rem­&para;<br>edy as anything other than an application of a plan’s&para;<br>terms. Brief for Petitioners 55–56; Reply Brief for Peti­&para;<br>tioners 3, and n. 8, 16–17. While this provision allows&para;<br>plaintiffs only to “enforce” or “clarify” rights or to “recover&para;<br>benefits” “under the terms of the plan,” §1132(a)(1)(B)&para;<br>(emphasis added), it does not so limit a court’s remedial&para;<br>authority, Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson,&para;<br>534 U. S. 204, 221 (2002) (In §1132(a)(1)(B), “Congress&para;<br>authorized ‘a participant or beneficiary’ to bring a civil&para;<br>action . . . without referenc[ing] whether the relief sought&para;<br>is legal or equitable”). The provision thus does not pro­&para;<br>hibit a court from shaping relief through the application of&para;<br>equitable principles, as trust law plainly permits. See,&para;<br>e.g., 2 Third Restatement §50, and Comment b, at 261&para;<br>(discussing remedial options); Bogert &amp; Bogert §870, at&para;<br>123–126 (2d rev. ed. 1995). Indeed, a court that finds, for&para;<br>example, that an administrator provided employees with&para;<br>inadequate notice of a plan’s terms (as was true here) may&para;<br>have no alternative but to rely significantly upon those&para;<br>principles. Cf. 29 U. S. C. §1104(a)(1)(D) (plan fiduciary&para;<br>must “discharge his dut[y] . . . in accordance with the&para;<br>documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as&para;<br>such documents and instruments are consistent” with&para;<br>ERISA).&para;<br>For these reasons I would affirm the decision of the&para;<br>Court of Appeals. And I therefore respectfully dissent&para;<br>from the majority’s contrary determination.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>CONKRIGHT v.

For the purposes of this Appendix, I make the&para;<br>following assumptions: John worked at Xerox for 10 years&para;<br>from 1970 to 1980. At the time of his departure from&para;<br>Xerox, he was issued a lump-sum benefits distribution of&para;<br>$140,000. He was then rehired in January 1989, and he&para;<br>worked for Xerox for 5 more years before retiring (until&para;<br>December 1993), earning $50,000 each year of his second&para;<br>term of employment. I also assume that (1) Xerox’s con­&para;<br>tribution to John’s investment account was $2,500 in 1989&para;<br>(the last year such accounts were offered), (2) Xerox’s&para;<br>contributions to John’s cash and investment accounts are&para;<br>always made on the final day of the year, (3) the rate of&para;<br>return in John’s cash and investment accounts is always 5&para;<br>percent, and (4) annuity rates are also always 5 percent.&para;<br>(For the sake of simplicity, I treat all annuities as perpe­&para;<br>tuities, meaning that I calculate the present value of the&para;<br>annuities thusly: Present Value = Annual Pay­&para;<br>ment/Annuity Rate.)&para;<br>Given the above assumptions, John’s pension upon his&para;<br>retirement would be $10,500 per year ($50,000 × 1.4 per­&para;<br>cent × 15 years), which has a present value of $210,000&para;<br>($10,500/5 percent). John’s cash and investment accounts&para;<br>at the end of his fifth year would look as follows (While&para;<br>Xerox’s ERISA Plan did not include cash accounts until&para;<br>1990, each employee’s opening cash account balance was&para;<br>credited with the balance of his investment account at the&para;<br>end of 1989. The figures for John’s cash account in 1989&para;<br>thus reflect the performance of his investment account.

In making this comparison, the Plan Administrator&para;<br>would assume that John had never left Xerox when calcu­&para;<br>lating John’s pension. The Plan Administrator would also&para;<br>assume, when calculating the value of John’s cash and&para;<br>investment accounts, that the lump-sum distribution John&para;<br>had received from Xerox had remained invested in his&para;<br>accounts. (In other words, the Plan Administrator would&para;<br>include the “phantom account” in his calculations. The&para;<br>total value of this phantom account in 1989, when John&para;<br>rejoined Xerox, is equal to John’s lump-sum distribution of&para;<br>$140,000 × 1.059, or approximately $217,200.)&para;<br>The Plan Administrator would thus compare John’s&para;<br>pension, column D, and column H to determine John’s&para;<br>benefit. As you can see above, column H provides the&para;<br>greatest benefit, so John’s cash account would be used to&para;<br>calculate the benefits he would receive upon retirement.&para;<br>Second, the Plan Administrator would “offset” John’s&para;<br>prior distribution against his current benefits to deter­&para;<br>mine the amount of benefits John would actually receive.&para;<br>Thus, the Plan Administrator would take the “total” value&para;<br>of John’s cash account, including the “phantom account”&para;<br>($277,800), and subtract out the value of the “phantom&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>CONKRIGHT v. FROMMERT&para;<br>dissenting&para;<br>BREYER&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>to the, J.,&para;<br>opinion&para;<br>of BREYER, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>account” ($264,000). The total present value of the bene­&para;<br>fits John would receive upon his second retirement would&para;<br>thus be $13,800.&para;<br>This means that John would receive approximately $690&para;<br>annually ($13,800 × 5 percent) upon retirement under the&para;<br>Plan Administrator’s “phantom account” approach. In&para;<br>comparison, if John had simply been treated as a new&para;<br>employee when he was rehired, his pension would have&para;<br>entitled him to at least $3,500 annually ($50,000 × 1.4&para;<br>percent × 5 years) upon his retirement. And the impact of&para;<br>the “phantom account” may have been even more dramatic&para;<br>with respect to some of the respondents in this case. See&para;<br>Brief for Respondents 24 (describing how respondent Paul&para;<br>Frommert erroneously received a report claiming that his&para;<br>retirement benefits were $2,482.00 per month, before later&para;<br>discovering that, because of the “phantom account,” his&para;<br>actual monthly pension was $5.31 per month); see also&para;<br>App. 63a.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
