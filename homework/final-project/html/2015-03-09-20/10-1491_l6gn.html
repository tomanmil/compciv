ROYAL DUTCH &para;<br>&para;<br>PETROLEUM CO. ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SECOND CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–1491. Argued February 28, 2012—Reargued October 1, 2012—&para;<br>Decided April 17, 2013&para;<br>Petitioners, Nigerian nationals residing in the United States, filed suit&para;<br>in federal court under the Alien Tort Statute, alleging that respondents—certain Dutch, British, and Nigerian corporations—aided and&para;<br>abetted the Nigerian Government in committing violations of the law&para;<br>of nations in Nigeria. The ATS provides that “[t]he district courts&para;<br>shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a&para;<br>tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of&para;<br>the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §1350. The District Court dismissed&para;<br>several of petitioners’ claims, but on interlocutory appeal, the Second&para;<br>Circuit dismissed the entire complaint, reasoning that the law of nations does not recognize corporate liability. This Court granted certiorari, and ordered supplemental briefing on whether and under what&para;<br>circumstances courts may recognize a cause of action under the ATS,&para;<br>for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a&para;<br>sovereign other than the United States.&para;<br>Held: The presumption against extraterritoriality applies to claims under the ATS, and nothing in the statute rebuts that presumption.&para;<br>Pp. 3–14.&para;<br>(a) Passed as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the ATS is a jurisdictional statute that creates no causes of action. It permits federal&para;<br>courts to “recognize private claims [for a modest number of international law violations] under federal common law.” Sosa v. AlvarezMachain, 542 U. S. 692, 732. In contending that a claim under the&para;<br>ATS does not reach conduct occurring in a foreign sovereign’s territo-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ry, respondents rely on the presumption against extraterritorial application, which provides that “[w]hen a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it has none,” Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S. ___, ___. The presumption&para;<br>“serves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and&para;<br>those of other nations which could result in international discord.”&para;<br>EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248. It is typically&para;<br>applied to discern whether an Act of Congress regulating conduct applies abroad, see, e.g., id., at 246, but its underlying principles similarly constrain courts when considering causes of action that may be&para;<br>brought under the ATS. Indeed, the danger of unwarranted judicial&para;<br>interference in the conduct of foreign policy is magnified in this context, where the question is not what Congress has done but what&para;<br>courts may do. These foreign policy concerns are not diminished by&para;<br>the fact that Sosa limited federal courts to recognizing causes of action only for alleged violations of international law norms that are&para;<br>“ ‘specific, universal, and obligatory,” 542 U. S., at 732. Pp. 3–6.&para;<br>(b) The presumption is not rebutted by the text, history, or purposes of the ATS. Nothing in the ATS’s text evinces a clear indication of&para;<br>extraterritorial reach. Violations of the law of nations affecting&para;<br>aliens can occur either within or outside the United States. And generic terms, like “any” in the phrase “any civil action,” do not rebut the&para;<br>presumption against extraterritoriality. See, e.g., Morrison, supra, at&para;<br>___. Petitioners also rely on the common-law “transitory torts” doctrine, but that doctrine is inapposite here; as the Court has explained, “the only justification for allowing a party to recover when&para;<br>the cause of action arose in another civilized jurisdiction is a wellfounded belief that it was a cause of action in that place,” Cuba R. Co.&para;<br>v. Crosby, 222 U. S. 473, 479. The question under Sosa is not whether a federal court has jurisdiction to entertain a cause of action provided by foreign or even international law. The question is instead&para;<br>whether the court has authority to recognize a cause of action under&para;<br>U. S. law to enforce a norm of international law. That question is not&para;<br>answered by the mere fact that the ATS mentions torts.&para;<br>The historical background against which the ATS was enacted also&para;<br>does not overcome the presumption. When the ATS was passed,&para;<br>“three principal offenses against the law of nations” had been identified by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement of the&para;<br>rights of ambassadors, and piracy. Sosa, supra, at 723, 724. Prominent contemporary examples of the first two offenses—immediately&para;<br>before and after passage of the ATS—provide no support for the&para;<br>proposition that Congress expected causes of action to be brought under the statute for violations of the law of nations occurring abroad.&para;<br>And although the offense of piracy normally occurs on the high seas,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the United States or any other&para;<br>country, applying U. S. law to pirates does not typically impose the&para;<br>sovereign will of the United States onto conduct occurring within the&para;<br>territorial jurisdiction of another sovereign, and therefore carries less&para;<br>direct foreign policy consequences. A 1795 opinion of Attorney General William Bradford regarding the conduct of U. S. citizens on both&para;<br>the high seas and a foreign shore is at best ambiguous about the&para;<br>ATS’s extraterritorial application; it does not suffice to counter the&para;<br>weighty concerns underlying the presumption against extraterritoriality. Finally, there is no indication that the ATS was passed to&para;<br>make the United States a uniquely hospitable forum for the enforcement of international norms.

Petitioners sued under the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U. S. C. §1350,&para;<br>alleging that the corporations aided and abetted the Nigerian Government in committing violations of the law of&para;<br>nations in Nigeria. The question presented is whether&para;<br>and under what circumstances courts may recognize a&para;<br>cause of action under the Alien Tort Statute, for violations&para;<br>of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a&para;<br>sovereign other than the United States.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Petitioners were residents of Ogoniland, an area of 250&para;<br>square miles located in the Niger delta area of Nigeria and&para;<br>populated by roughly half a million people. When the&para;<br>complaint was filed, respondents Royal Dutch Petroleum&para;<br>Company and Shell Transport and Trading Company,&para;<br>p.l.c., were holding companies incorporated in the Nether-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>lands and England, respectively. Their joint subsidiary,&para;<br>respondent Shell Petroleum Development Company of&para;<br>Nigeria, Ltd. (SPDC), was incorporated in Nigeria, and&para;<br>engaged in oil exploration and production in Ogoniland.&para;<br>According to the complaint, after concerned residents of&para;<br>Ogoniland began protesting the environmental effects of&para;<br>SPDC’s practices, respondents enlisted the Nigerian Government to violently suppress the burgeoning demonstrations. Throughout the early 1990’s, the complaint alleges,&para;<br>Nigerian military and police forces attacked Ogoni villages, beating, raping, killing, and arresting residents and&para;<br>destroying or looting property. Petitioners further allege&para;<br>that respondents aided and abetted these atrocities by,&para;<br>among other things, providing the Nigerian forces with&para;<br>food, transportation, and compensation, as well as by allowing the Nigerian military to use respondents’ property&para;<br>as a staging ground for attacks.&para;<br>Following the alleged atrocities, petitioners moved to&para;<br>the United States where they have been granted political&para;<br>asylum and now reside as legal residents. See Supp. Brief&para;<br>for Petitioners 3, and n. 2. They filed suit in the United&para;<br>States District Court for the Southern District of New&para;<br>York, alleging jurisdiction under the Alien Tort Statute&para;<br>and requesting relief under customary international law.&para;<br>The ATS provides, in full, that “[t]he district courts shall&para;<br>have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for&para;<br>a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or&para;<br>a treaty of the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §1350. According to petitioners, respondents violated the law of nations&para;<br>by aiding and abetting the Nigerian Government in committing (1) extrajudicial killings; (2) crimes against humanity; (3) torture and cruel treatment; (4) arbitrary&para;<br>arrest and detention; (5) violations of the rights to life,&para;<br>liberty, security, and association; (6) forced exile; and (7)&para;<br>property destruction. The District Court dismissed the&para;<br>first, fifth, sixth, and seventh claims, reasoning that the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>facts alleged to support those claims did not give rise to a&para;<br>violation of the law of nations. The court denied respondents’ motion to dismiss with respect to the remaining&para;<br>claims, but certified its order for interlocutory appeal&para;<br>pursuant to §1292(b).&para;<br>The Second Circuit dismissed the entire complaint, reasoning that the law of nations does not recognize corporate liability. 621 F. 3d 111 (2010). We granted certiorari&para;<br>to consider that question. 565 U. S. ___ (2011). After oral&para;<br>argument, we directed the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing an additional question: “Whether&para;<br>and under what circumstances the [ATS] allows courts&para;<br>to recognize a cause of action for violations of the law of&para;<br>nations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other&para;<br>than the United States.” 565 U. S. ___ (2012). We heard&para;<br>oral argument again and now affirm the judgment below,&para;<br>based on our answer to the second question.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Passed as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the ATS was&para;<br>invoked twice in the late 18th century, but then only once&para;<br>more over the next 167 years. Act of Sept. 24, 1789, §9, 1&para;<br>Stat 77; see Moxon v. The Fanny, 17 F. Cas. 942 (No.&para;<br>9,895) (DC Pa. 1793); Bolchos v. Darrel, 3 F. Cas. 810 (No.&para;<br>1,607) (DC SC 1795); O’Reilly de Camara v. Brooke, 209&para;<br>U. S. 45 (1908); Khedivial Line, S.A.E. v. Seafarers’ Int’l&para;<br>Union, 278 F. 2d 49, 51–52 (CA2 1960) (per curiam). The&para;<br>statute provides district courts with jurisdiction to hear&para;<br>certain claims, but does not expressly provide any causes&para;<br>of action. We held in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S.&para;<br>692, 714 (2004), however, that the First Congress did not&para;<br>intend the provision to be “stillborn.” The grant of jurisdiction is instead “best read as having been enacted on the&para;<br>understanding that the common law would provide a&para;<br>cause of action for [a] modest number of international law&para;<br>violations.” Id., at 724. We thus held that federal courts&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>may “recognize private claims [for such violations] under&para;<br>federal common law.” Id., at 732. The Court in Sosa&para;<br>rejected the plaintiff ’s claim in that case for “arbitrary&para;<br>arrest and detention,” on the ground that it failed to state&para;<br>a violation of the law of nations with the requisite “definite content and acceptance among civilized nations.” Id.,&para;<br>at 699, 732.&para;<br>The question here is not whether petitioners have stated&para;<br>a proper claim under the ATS, but whether a claim may&para;<br>reach conduct occurring in the territory of a foreign sovereign. Respondents contend that claims under the ATS&para;<br>do not, relying primarily on a canon of statutory interpretation known as the presumption against extraterritorial&para;<br>application. That canon provides that “[w]hen a statute&para;<br>gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application,&para;<br>it has none,” Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd.,&para;<br>561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 6), and reflects the&para;<br>“presumption that United States law governs domestically&para;<br>but does not rule the world,” Microsoft Corp. v. AT&amp;T&para;<br>Corp., 550 U. S. 437, 454 (2007).&para;<br>This presumption “serves to protect against unintended&para;<br>clashes between our laws and those of other nations which&para;<br>could result in international discord.” EEOC v. Arabian&para;<br>American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991) (Aramco). As&para;<br>this Court has explained:&para;<br>“For us to run interference in . . . a delicate field of&para;<br>international relations there must be present the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed.&para;<br>It alone has the facilities necessary to make fairly&para;<br>such an important policy decision where the possibilities of international discord are so evident and retaliative action so certain.” Benz v. Compania Naviera&para;<br>Hidalgo, S. A., 353 U. S. 138, 147 (1957). The presumption against extraterritorial application helps&para;<br>ensure that the Judiciary does not erroneously adopt&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>an interpretation of U. S. law that carries foreign policy consequences not clearly intended by the political&para;<br>branches.&para;<br>We typically apply the presumption to discern whether&para;<br>an Act of Congress regulating conduct applies abroad.&para;<br>See, e.g., Aramco, supra, at 246 (“These cases present the&para;<br>issue whether Title VII applies extraterritorially to regulate the employment practices of United States employers&para;<br>who employ United States citizens abroad”); Morrison,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (noting that the question of&para;<br>extraterritorial application was a “merits question,” not a&para;<br>question of jurisdiction). The ATS, on the other hand, is&para;<br>“strictly jurisdictional.” Sosa, 542 U. S., at 713. It does&para;<br>not directly regulate conduct or afford relief. It instead&para;<br>allows federal courts to recognize certain causes of action&para;<br>based on sufficiently definite norms of international law.&para;<br>But we think the principles underlying the canon of interpretation similarly constrain courts considering causes of&para;<br>action that may be brought under the ATS.&para;<br>Indeed, the danger of unwarranted judicial interference&para;<br>in the conduct of foreign policy is magnified in the context&para;<br>of the ATS, because the question is not what Congress has&para;<br>done but instead what courts may do. This Court in Sosa&para;<br>repeatedly stressed the need for judicial caution in considering which claims could be brought under the ATS, in&para;<br>light of foreign policy concerns. As the Court explained,&para;<br>“the potential [foreign policy] implications . . . of recognizing . . . . causes [under the ATS] should make courts&para;<br>particularly wary of impinging on the discretion of the&para;<br>Legislative and Executive Branches in managing foreign&para;<br>affairs.” Id., at 727; see also id., at 727–728 (“Since many&para;<br>attempts by federal courts to craft remedies for the violation of new norms of international law would raise risks of&para;<br>adverse foreign policy consequences, they should be undertaken, if at all, with great caution”); id., at 727 (“[T]he&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>possible collateral consequences of making international&para;<br>rules privately actionable argue for judicial caution”).&para;<br>These concerns, which are implicated in any case arising&para;<br>under the ATS, are all the more pressing when the question is whether a cause of action under the ATS reaches&para;<br>conduct within the territory of another sovereign.&para;<br>These concerns are not diminished by the fact that Sosa&para;<br>limited federal courts to recognizing causes of action only&para;<br>for alleged violations of international law norms that are&para;<br>“ ‘specific, universal, and obligatory.’ ” Id., at 732 (quoting&para;<br>In re Estate of Marcos, Human Rights Litigation, 25 F. 3d&para;<br>1467, 1475 (CA9 1994)). As demonstrated by Congress’s&para;<br>enactment of the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991,&para;<br>106 Stat. 73, note following 28 U. S. C. §1350, identifying&para;<br>such a norm is only the beginning of defining a cause of&para;<br>action. See id., §3 (providing detailed definitions for extrajudicial killing and torture); id., §2 (specifying who may be&para;<br>liable, creating a rule of exhaustion, and establishing a&para;<br>statute of limitations). Each of these decisions carries&para;<br>with it significant foreign policy implications.&para;<br>The principles underlying the presumption against extraterritoriality thus constrain courts exercising their power&para;<br>under the ATS.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Petitioners contend that even if the presumption applies, the text, history, and purposes of the ATS rebut&para;<br>it for causes of action brought under that statute. It is&para;<br>true that Congress, even in a jurisdictional provision, can&para;<br>indicate that it intends federal law to apply to conduct&para;<br>occurring abroad. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §1091(e) (2006 ed.,&para;<br>Supp. V) (providing jurisdiction over the offense of genocide “regardless of where the offense is committed” if&para;<br>the alleged offender is, among other things, “present in the&para;<br>United States”). But to rebut the presumption, the ATS&para;<br>would need to evince a “clear indication of extraterritorial-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ity.” Morrison, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16). It does&para;<br>not.&para;<br>To begin, nothing in the text of the statute suggests that&para;<br>Congress intended causes of action recognized under it&para;<br>to have extraterritorial reach. The ATS covers actions by&para;<br>aliens for violations of the law of nations, but that does&para;<br>not imply extraterritorial reach—such violations affecting aliens can occur either within or outside the United&para;<br>States. Nor does the fact that the text reaches “any civil&para;<br>action” suggest application to torts committed abroad; it is&para;<br>well established that generic terms like “any” or “every” do&para;<br>not rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality. See,&para;<br>e.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at 13–14); Small v. United States,&para;<br>544 U. S. 385, 388 (2005); Aramco, 499 U. S., at 248–250;&para;<br>Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 287 (1949).&para;<br>Petitioners make much of the fact that the ATS provides&para;<br>jurisdiction over civil actions for “torts” in violation of the&para;<br>law of nations. They claim that in using that word, the&para;<br>First Congress “necessarily meant to provide for jurisdiction over extraterritorial transitory torts that could arise&para;<br>on foreign soil.” Supp. Brief for Petitioners 18. For support, they cite the common-law doctrine that allowed&para;<br>courts to assume jurisdiction over such “transitory torts,”&para;<br>including actions for personal injury, arising abroad. See&para;<br>Mostyn v. Fabrigas, 1 Cowp. 161, 177, 98 Eng. Rep. 1021,&para;<br>1030 (1774) (Mansfield, L.) (“[A]ll actions of a transitory&para;<br>nature that arise abroad may be laid as happening in an&para;<br>English county”); Dennick v. Railroad Co., 103 U. S. 11, 18&para;<br>(1881) (“Wherever, by either the common law or the statute law of a State, a right of action has become fixed and a&para;<br>legal liability incurred, that liability may be enforced and&para;<br>the right of action pursued in any court which has jurisdiction of such matters and can obtain jurisdiction of the&para;<br>parties”).&para;<br>Under the transitory torts doctrine, however, “the only&para;<br>justification for allowing a party to recover when the cause&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of action arose in another civilized jurisdiction is a well&para;<br>founded belief that it was a cause of action in that place.”&para;<br>Cuba R. Co. v. Crosby, 222 U. S. 473, 479 (1912) (majority&para;<br>opinion of Holmes, J.). The question under Sosa is not&para;<br>whether a federal court has jurisdiction to entertain a&para;<br>cause of action provided by foreign or even international&para;<br>law. The question is instead whether the court has authority to recognize a cause of action under U. S. law to&para;<br>enforce a norm of international law. The reference to&para;<br>“tort” does not demonstrate that the First Congress “necessarily meant” for those causes of action to reach conduct&para;<br>in the territory of a foreign sovereign. In the end, nothing&para;<br>in the text of the ATS evinces the requisite clear indication&para;<br>of extraterritoriality.&para;<br>Nor does the historical background against which the&para;<br>ATS was enacted overcome the presumption against application to conduct in the territory of another sovereign.&para;<br>See Morrison, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (noting&para;<br>that “[a]ssuredly context can be consulted” in determining&para;<br>whether a cause of action applies abroad). We explained&para;<br>in Sosa that when Congress passed the ATS, “three principal offenses against the law of nations” had been identified by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement&para;<br>of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy. 542 U. S., at&para;<br>723, 724; see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws&para;<br>of England 68 (1769). The first two offenses have no&para;<br>necessary extraterritorial application. Indeed, Blackstone—&para;<br>in describing them—did so in terms of conduct occurring within the forum nation. See ibid. (describing the&para;<br>right of safe conducts for those “who are here”); 1 id.,&para;<br>at 251 (1765) (explaining that safe conducts grant a member of one society “a right to intrude into another”); id., at&para;<br>245–248 (recognizing the king’s power to “receiv[e] ambassadors at home” and detailing their rights in the state&para;<br>“wherein they are appointed to reside”); see also E. De&para;<br>Vattel, Law of Nations 465 (J. Chitty et al. transl. and ed.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>1883) (“[O]n his entering the country to which he is sent,&para;<br>and making himself known, [the ambassador] is under the&para;<br>protection of the law of nations . . .”).&para;<br>Two notorious episodes involving violations of the law of&para;<br>nations occurred in the United States shortly before passage of the ATS. Each concerned the rights of ambassadors, and each involved conduct within the Union. In&para;<br>1784, a French adventurer verbally and physically assaulted Francis Barbe Marbois—the Secretary of the&para;<br>French Legion—in Philadelphia. The assault led the&para;<br>French Minister Plenipotentiary to lodge a formal protest&para;<br>with the Continental Congress and threaten to leave the&para;<br>country unless an adequate remedy were provided.&para;<br>Respublica v. De Longschamps, 1 Dall. 111 (O. T. Phila.&para;<br>1784); Sosa, supra, at 716–717, and n. 11. And in 1787,&para;<br>a New York constable entered the Dutch Ambassador’s&para;<br>house and arrested one of his domestic servants. See&para;<br>Casto, The Federal Courts’ Protective Jurisdiction over&para;<br>Torts Committed in Violation of the Law of Nations, 18&para;<br>Conn. L. Rev. 467, 494 (1986). At the request of Secretary&para;<br>of Foreign Affairs John Jay, the Mayor of New York City&para;<br>arrested the constable in turn, but cautioned that because&para;<br>“ ‘neither Congress nor our [State] Legislature have yet&para;<br>passed any act respecting a breach of the privileges of&para;<br>Ambassadors,’ ” the extent of any available relief would&para;<br>depend on the common law. See Bradley, The Alien Tort&para;<br>Statute and Article III, 42 Va. J. Int’l L. 587, 641–642&para;<br>(2002) (quoting 3 Dept. of State, The Diplomatic Correspondence of the United States of America 447 (1837)).&para;<br>The two cases in which the ATS was invoked shortly after&para;<br>its passage also concerned conduct within the territory of&para;<br>the United States. See Bolchos, 3 F. Cas. 810 (wrongful&para;<br>seizure of slaves from a vessel while in port in the United&para;<br>States); Moxon, 17 F.

ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>before and after passage of the ATS—provide no support&para;<br>for the proposition that Congress expected causes of action&para;<br>to be brought under the statute for violations of the law of&para;<br>nations occurring abroad.&para;<br>The third example of a violation of the law of nations&para;<br>familiar to the Congress that enacted the ATS was piracy.&para;<br>Piracy typically occurs on the high seas, beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the United States or any other country. See 4 Blackstone, supra, at 72 (“The offence of piracy,&para;<br>by common law, consists of committing those acts of robbery and depredation upon the high seas, which, if committed upon land, would have amounted to felony there”).&para;<br>This Court has generally treated the high seas the same&para;<br>as foreign soil for purposes of the presumption against&para;<br>extraterritorial application. See, e.g., Sale v. Haitian&para;<br>Centers Council, Inc., 509 U. S. 155, 173–174 (1993) (declining to apply a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act to conduct occurring on the high seas); Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S.&para;<br>428, 440 (1989) (declining to apply a provision of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 to the high seas).&para;<br>Petitioners contend that because Congress surely intended&para;<br>the ATS to provide jurisdiction for actions against pirates,&para;<br>it necessarily anticipated the statute would apply to conduct occurring abroad.&para;<br>Applying U. S. law to pirates, however, does not typically impose the sovereign will of the United States onto&para;<br>conduct occurring within the territorial jurisdiction of&para;<br>another sovereign, and therefore carries less direct foreign&para;<br>policy consequences. Pirates were fair game wherever&para;<br>found, by any nation, because they generally did not operate within any jurisdiction. See 4 Blackstone, supra, at&para;<br>71. We do not think that the existence of a cause of action&para;<br>against them is a sufficient basis for concluding that other&para;<br>causes of action under the ATS reach conduct that does&para;<br>occur within the territory of another sovereign; pirates&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

In 1794, in the midst of war&para;<br>between France and Great Britain, and notwithstanding&para;<br>the American official policy of neutrality, several U. S.&para;<br>citizens joined a French privateer fleet and attacked and&para;<br>plundered the British colony of Sierra Leone. In response&para;<br>to a protest from the British Ambassador, Attorney General Bradford responded as follows:&para;<br>So far . . . as the transactions complained of originated or took place in a foreign country, they are not&para;<br>within the cognizance of our courts; nor can the actors&para;<br>be legally prosecuted or punished for them by the&para;<br>United States. But crimes committed on the high&para;<br>seas are within the jurisdiction of the . . . courts of the&para;<br>United States; and, so far as the offence was committed thereon, I am inclined to think that it may be legally prosecuted in . . . those courts . . . . But some&para;<br>doubt rests on this point, in consequence of the terms&para;<br>in which the [applicable criminal law] is expressed.&para;<br>But there can be no doubt that the company or individuals who have been injured by these acts of hostility have a remedy by a civil suit in the courts of the&para;<br>United States; jurisdiction being expressly given to&para;<br>these courts in all cases where an alien sues for a tort&para;<br>only, in violation of the laws of nations, or a treaty of&para;<br>the United States . . . .” Id., at 58–59.&para;<br>Petitioners read the last sentence as confirming that&para;<br>“the Founding generation understood the ATS to apply to&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>law of nations violations committed on the territory of a&para;<br>foreign sovereign.” Supp. Brief for Petitioners 33. Respondents counter that when Attorney General Bradford&para;<br>referred to “these acts of hostility,” he meant the acts only&para;<br>insofar as they took place on the high seas, and even if his&para;<br>conclusion were broader, it was only because the applicable treaty had extraterritorial reach. See Supp. Brief for&para;<br>Respondents 28–30. The Solicitor General, having once&para;<br>read the opinion to stand for the proposition that an “ATS&para;<br>suit could be brought against American citizens for&para;<br>breaching neutrality with Britain only if acts did not take&para;<br>place in a foreign country,” Supp. Brief for United States&para;<br>as Amicus Curiae 8, n. 1 (internal quotation marks and&para;<br>brackets omitted), now suggests the opinion “could have&para;<br>been meant to encompass . . . conduct [occurring within&para;<br>the foreign territory],” id., at 8.&para;<br>Attorney General Bradford’s opinion defies a definitive&para;<br>reading and we need not adopt one here. Whatever its precise meaning, it deals with U. S. citizens who, by participating in an attack taking place both on the high seas&para;<br>and on a foreign shore, violated a treaty between the&para;<br>United States and Great Britain. The opinion hardly&para;<br>suffices to counter the weighty concerns underlying the&para;<br>presumption against extraterritoriality.&para;<br>Finally, there is no indication that the ATS was passed&para;<br>to make the United States a uniquely hospitable forum for&para;<br>the enforcement of international norms. As Justice Story&para;<br>put it, “No nation has ever yet pretended to be the custos&para;<br>morum of the whole world . . . .” United States v. The La&para;<br>Jeune Eugenie, 26 F. Cas. 832, 847 (No. 15,551) (CC.&para;<br>Mass. 1822). It is implausible to suppose that the First&para;<br>Congress wanted their fledgling Republic—struggling to&para;<br>receive international recognition—to be the first. Indeed,&para;<br>the parties offer no evidence that any nation, meek or&para;<br>mighty, presumed to do such a thing.&para;<br>The United States was, however, embarrassed by its&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

Bradley, 42 Va. J.&para;<br>Int’l L., at 641. Such offenses against ambassadors violated the law of nations, “and if not adequately redressed&para;<br>could rise to an issue of war.” Sosa, 542 U. S., at 715; cf.&para;<br>The Federalist No. 80, p. 536 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (“As the denial or perversion of justice . . . is with&para;<br>reason classed among the just causes of war, it will follow&para;<br>that the federal judiciary ought to have cognizance of all&para;<br>causes in which the citizens of other countries are concerned”). The ATS ensured that the United States could&para;<br>provide a forum for adjudicating such incidents. See Sosa,&para;<br>supra, at 715–718, and n. 11. Nothing about this historical context suggests that Congress also intended federal&para;<br>common law under the ATS to provide a cause of action for&para;<br>conduct occurring in the territory of another sovereign.&para;<br>Indeed, far from avoiding diplomatic strife, providing&para;<br>such a cause of action could have generated it. Recent&para;<br>experience bears this out. See Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp.,&para;<br>654 F. 3d 11, 77–78 (CADC 2011) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting in part) (listing recent objections to extraterritorial&para;<br>applications of the ATS by Canada, Germany, Indonesia,&para;<br>Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Switzerland, and the&para;<br>United Kingdom). Moreover, accepting petitioners’ view&para;<br>would imply that other nations, also applying the law of&para;<br>nations, could hale our citizens into their courts for alleged&para;<br>violations of the law of nations occurring in the United&para;<br>States, or anywhere else in the world. The presumption&para;<br>against extraterritoriality guards against our courts triggering such serious foreign policy consequences, and instead defers such decisions, quite appropriately, to the&para;<br>political branches.&para;<br>We therefore conclude that the presumption against&para;<br>extraterritoriality applies to claims under the ATS, and&para;<br>that nothing in the statute rebuts that presumption.&para;<br>“[T]here is no clear indication of extraterritoriality here,”&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>KIOBEL v.

Specifically, I agree that when&para;<br>Alien Tort Statute (ATS) “claims touch and concern the&para;<br>territory of the United States, they must do so with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application.” Ante, at 14. This formulation obviously&para;<br>leaves much unanswered, and perhaps there is wisdom&para;<br>in the Court’s preference for this narrow approach. I write&para;<br>separately to set out the broader standard that leads me&para;<br>to the conclusion that this case falls within the scope of&para;<br>the presumption.&para;<br>In Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S.&para;<br>___ (2010), we explained that “the presumption against&para;<br>extraterritorial application would be a craven watchdog&para;<br>indeed if it retreated to its kennel whenever some domestic activity is involved in the case.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>17). We also reiterated that a cause of action falls outside the scope of the presumption—and thus is not barred&para;<br>by the presumption—only if the event or relationship that&para;<br>was “the ‘focus’ of congressional concern” under the relevant statute takes place within the United States. Ibid.&para;<br>(quoting EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.&para;<br>ALITO, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>244, 255 (1991)). For example, because “the focus of the&para;<br>[Securities] Exchange Act [of 1934] is not upon the place&para;<br>where the deception originated, but upon purchases and&para;<br>sales of securities in the United States,” we held in Morrison that §10(b) of the Exchange Act applies “only” to&para;<br>“transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges,&para;<br>and domestic transactions in other securities.” 561 U. S.,&para;<br>at ___–___ (slip op., at 17–18).&para;<br>The Court’s decision in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542&para;<br>U. S. 692 (2004), makes clear that when the ATS was&para;<br>enacted, “congressional concern” was “ ‘focus[ed],’ ” Morrison, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 17), on the “three principal&para;<br>offenses against the law of nations” that had been identified by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement&para;<br>of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy, Sosa, 542 U. S.,&para;<br>at 723–724. The Court therefore held that “federal courts&para;<br>should not recognize private claims under federal common&para;<br>law for violations of any international law norm with less&para;<br>definite content and acceptance among civilized nations&para;<br>than the historical paradigms familiar when [the ATS]&para;<br>was enacted.” Id., at 732. In other words, only conduct&para;<br>that satisfies Sosa’s requirements of definiteness and acceptance among civilized nations can be said to have been&para;<br>“the ‘focus’ of congressional concern,” Morrison, supra, at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 17), when Congress enacted the ATS. As a&para;<br>result, a putative ATS cause of action will fall within the&para;<br>scope of the presumption against extraterritoriality—and&para;<br>will therefore be barred—unless the domestic conduct is&para;<br>sufficient to violate an international law norm that satisfies Sosa’s requirements of definiteness and acceptance&para;<br>among civilized nations.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

The Court sets forth four key propositions of&para;<br>law: First, the “presumption against extraterritoriality&para;<br>applies to claims under” the Alien Tort Statute. Ante, at&para;<br>13. Second, “nothing in the statute rebuts that presumption.” Ibid. Third, there “is no clear indication of extraterritoria[l application] here,” where “all the relevant&para;<br>conduct took place outside the United States” and “where&para;<br>the claims” do not “touch and concern the territory of the&para;<br>United States . . . with sufficient force to displace the&para;<br>presumption.” Ante, at 13–14 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). Fourth, that is in part because “[c]orporations&para;<br>are often present in many countries, and it would reach&para;<br>too far to say that mere corporate presence suffices.” Ante,&para;<br>at 14.&para;<br>Unlike the Court, I would not invoke the presumption&para;<br>against extraterritoriality. Rather, guided in part by&para;<br>principles and practices of foreign relations law, I would&para;<br>find jurisdiction under this statute where (1) the alleged&para;<br>tort occurs on American soil, (2) the defendant is an American national, or (3) the defendant’s conduct substantially&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>and adversely affects an important American national&para;<br>interest, and that includes a distinct interest in preventing the United States from becoming a safe harbor (free of&para;<br>civil as well as criminal liability) for a torturer or other&para;<br>common enemy of mankind. See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain,&para;<br>542 U. S. 692, 732 (2004) (“ ‘[F]or purposes of civil liability,&para;<br>the torturer has become—like the pirate and slave trader&para;<br>before him—hostis humani generis, an enemy of all mankind.’ ” (quoting Filartiga v.

In this case, however, the&para;<br>parties and relevant conduct lack sufficient ties to the&para;<br>United States for the ATS to provide jurisdiction.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Our decision in Sosa frames the question. In Sosa the&para;<br>Court specified that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), when&para;<br>enacted in 1789, “was intended as jurisdictional.” 542&para;<br>U. S., at 714. We added that the statute gives today’s&para;<br>courts the power to apply certain “judge-made” damages&para;<br>law to victims of certain foreign affairs-related misconduct, including “three specific offenses” to which “Blackstone referred,” namely “violation of safe conducts, infringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.” Id.,&para;<br>at 715. We held that the statute provides today’s federal&para;<br>judges with the power to fashion “a cause of action” for a&para;<br>“modest number” of claims, “based on the present-day law&para;<br>of nations,” and which “rest on a norm of international&para;<br>character accepted by the civilized world and defined with&para;<br>a specificity comparable to the features” of those three&para;<br>“18th-century paradigms.” Id., at 724–725.&para;<br>We further said that, in doing so, a requirement of&para;<br>“exhaust[ion]” of “remedies” might apply. Id., at 733,&para;<br>n. 21. We noted “a strong argument that federal courts&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>should give serious weight to the Executive Branch’s view&para;<br>of the case’s impact on foreign policy.” Ibid. Adjudicating&para;<br>any such claim must, in my view, also be consistent with&para;<br>those notions of comity that lead each nation to respect the&para;<br>sovereign rights of other nations by limiting the reach of&para;<br>its own laws and their enforcement. Id., at 761 (BREYER,&para;<br>J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). See&para;<br>also F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Empagran S. A., 542&para;<br>U. S. 155, 165–169 (2004).&para;<br>Recognizing that Congress enacted the ATS to permit&para;<br>recovery of damages from pirates and others who violated&para;<br>basic international law norms as understood in 1789, Sosa&para;<br>essentially leads today’s judges to ask: Who are today’s&para;<br>pirates? See 542 U. S., at 724–725 (majority opinion). We&para;<br>provided a framework for answering that question by&para;<br>setting down principles drawn from international norms&para;<br>and designed to limit ATS claims to those that are similar&para;<br>in character and specificity to piracy. Id., at 725.&para;<br>In this case we must decide the extent to which this&para;<br>jurisdictional statute opens a federal court’s doors to those&para;<br>harmed by activities belonging to the limited class that&para;<br>Sosa set forth when those activities take place abroad. To&para;<br>help answer this question here, I would refer both to Sosa&para;<br>and, as in Sosa, to norms of international law. See Part II,&para;<br>infra.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In my view the majority’s effort to answer the question&para;<br>by referring to the “presumption against extraterritoriality”&para;<br>does not work well. That presumption “rests on the perception that Congress ordinarily legislates with respect&para;<br>to domestic, not foreign matters.” Morrison v. National&para;<br>Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at&para;<br>5–6). See ante, at 4. The ATS, however, was enacted with&para;<br>“foreign matters” in mind. The statute’s text refers explicitly to “alien[s],” “treat[ies],” and “the law of nations.” 28&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>U. S. C. §1350. The statute’s purpose was to address&para;<br>“violations of the law of nations, admitting of a judicial&para;<br>remedy and at the same time threatening serious consequences in international affairs.” Sosa, 542 U. S., at&para;<br>715. And at least one of the three kinds of activities that&para;<br>we found to fall within the statute’s scope, namely piracy,&para;<br>ibid., normally takes place abroad. See 4 W. Blackstone,&para;<br>Commentaries on the Law of England 72 (1769).&para;<br>The majority cannot wish this piracy example away by&para;<br>emphasizing that piracy takes place on the high seas. See&para;<br>ante, at 10. That is because the robbery and murder that&para;<br>make up piracy do not normally take place in the water;&para;<br>they take place on a ship. And a ship is like land, in that&para;<br>it falls within the jurisdiction of the nation whose flag it&para;<br>flies. See McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros&para;<br>de Honduras, 372 U. S. 10, 20–21 (1963); 2 Restatement&para;<br>§502, Comment d (“[F]lag state has jurisdiction to prescribe with respect to any activity aboard the ship”).&para;<br>Indeed, in the early 19th century Chief Justice Marshall&para;<br>described piracy as an “offenc[e] against the nation under&para;<br>whose flag the vessel sails, and within whose particular&para;<br>jurisdiction all on board the vessel are.” United States v.&para;<br>Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 632 (1818). See United States v.&para;<br>Furlong, 5 Wheat. 184, 197 (1820) (a crime committed&para;<br>“within the jurisdiction” of a foreign state and a crime&para;<br>committed “in the vessel of another nation” are “the same&para;<br>thing”).&para;<br>The majority nonetheless tries to find a distinction&para;<br>between piracy at sea and similar cases on land. It writes,&para;<br>“Applying U. S. law to pirates . . . does not typically impose the sovereign will of the United States onto conduct&para;<br>occurring within the territorial jurisdiction of another&para;<br>sovereign and therefore carries less direct foreign policy&para;<br>consequences.” Ante, at 10 (emphasis added). But, as I&para;<br>have just pointed out, “[a]pplying U. S. law to pirates” does&para;<br>typically involve applying our law to acts taking place&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>within the jurisdiction of another sovereign. Nor can&para;<br>the majority’s words “territorial jurisdiction” sensibly distinguish land from sea for purposes of isolating adverse&para;<br>foreign policy risks, as the Barbary Pirates, the War of&para;<br>1812, the sinking of the Lusitania, and the Lockerbie&para;<br>bombing make all too clear.&para;<br>The majority also writes, “Pirates were fair game wherever found, by any nation, because they generally did not&para;<br>operate within any jurisdiction.” Ibid. I very much agree&para;<br>that pirates were fair game “wherever found.” Indeed,&para;<br>that is the point. That is why we asked, in Sosa, who are&para;<br>today’s pirates? Certainly today’s pirates include torturers and perpetrators of genocide. And today, like the&para;<br>pirates of old, they are “fair game” where they are found.&para;<br>Like those pirates, they are “common enemies of all mankind and all nations have an equal interest in their apprehension and punishment.” 1 Restatement §404 Reporters’&para;<br>Note 1, p. 256 (quoting In re Demjanjuk, 612 F. Supp. 544,&para;<br>556 (ND Ohio 1985) (internal quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>See Sosa, supra, at 732. And just as a nation that harbored pirates provoked the concern of other nations in past&para;<br>centuries, see infra, at 8, so harboring “common enemies&para;<br>of all mankind” provokes similar concerns today.&para;<br>Thus the Court’s reasoning, as applied to the narrow&para;<br>class of cases that Sosa described, fails to provide significant support for the use of any presumption against extraterritoriality; rather, it suggests the contrary. See also&para;<br>ante, at 10 (conceding and citing cases showing that this&para;<br>Court has “generally treated the high seas the same as&para;<br>foreign soil for purposes of the presumption against extraterritorial application”).&para;<br>In any event, as the Court uses its “presumption against&para;<br>extraterritorial application,” it offers only limited help in&para;<br>deciding the question presented, namely “ ‘under what&para;<br>circumstances the Alien Tort Statute . . . allows courts to&para;<br>recognize a cause of action for violations of the law of&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>nations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other&para;<br>than the United States.’ ” 565 U. S. ___ (2012). The majority echoes in this jurisdictional context Sosa’s warning&para;<br>to use “caution” in shaping federal common-law causes of&para;<br>action. Ante, at 5. But it also makes clear that a statutory&para;<br>claim might sometimes “touch and concern the territory of&para;<br>the United States . . . with sufficient force to displace the&para;<br>presumption.” Ante, at 14. It leaves for another day the&para;<br>determination of just when the presumption against extraterritoriality might be “overcome.” Ante, at 8.&para;<br>II&para;<br>In applying the ATS to acts “occurring within the territory of a[nother] sovereign,” I would assume that Congress&para;<br>intended the statute’s jurisdictional reach to match the&para;<br>statute’s underlying substantive grasp.

S., at 715. And just as&para;<br>we have looked to established international substantive&para;<br>norms to help determine the statute’s substantive reach,&para;<br>id., at 729, so we should look to international jurisdictional&para;<br>norms to help determine the statute’s jurisdictional&para;<br>scope.&para;<br>The Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law is&para;<br>helpful. Section 402 recognizes that, subject to §403’s “reasonableness” requirement, a nation may apply its law&para;<br>(for example, federal common law, see 542 U.

Doing&para;<br>so reflects the fact that Congress adopted the present&para;<br>statute at a time when, as Justice Story put it, “No nation&para;<br>ha[d] ever yet pretended to be the custos morum of the&para;<br>whole world.” United States v. La Jeune Eugenie, 26&para;<br>F. Cas. 832, 847 (No. 15,551) (CC Mass. 1822). That restriction also should help to minimize international friction. Further limiting principles such as exhaustion,&para;<br>forum non conveniens, and comity would do the same. So&para;<br>would a practice of courts giving weight to the views of the&para;<br>Executive Branch. See Sosa, 542 U. S., at 733, n. 21; id.,&para;<br>at 761 (opinion of BREYER, J.).&para;<br>As I have indicated, we should treat this Nation’s interest&para;<br>in not becoming a safe harbor for violators of the most fundamental international norms as an important jurisdictionrelated interest justifying application of the ATS in light of&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>KIOBEL v.

Palestinian Authority, 566 U.

Rather, Congress has enacted other statutes, and&para;<br>not only criminal statutes, that allow the United States to&para;<br>prosecute (or allow victims to obtain damages from) foreign persons who injure foreign victims by committing&para;<br>abroad torture, genocide, and other heinous acts. See, e.g.,&para;<br>18 U. S. C. §2340A(b)(2) (authorizing prosecution of torturers if “the alleged offender is present in the United&para;<br>States, irrespective of the nationality of the victim or&para;<br>alleged offender”); §1091(e)(2)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. V)&para;<br>(genocide prosecution authorized when, “regardless of&para;<br>where the offense is committed, the alleged offender is . . .&para;<br>present in the United States”); note following 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1350, §2(a) (private right of action on behalf of individuals harmed by an act of torture or extrajudicial killing&para;<br>committed “under actual or apparent authority, or color of&para;<br>law, of any foreign nation”). See also S. Rep. No. 102–249,&para;<br>supra, at 3–4 (purpose to “mak[e] sure that torturers and&para;<br>death squads will no longer have a safe haven in the&para;<br>United States,” by “providing a civil cause of action in&para;<br>U. S. courts for torture committed abroad”).&para;<br>Thus, the jurisdictional approach that I would use is&para;<br>analogous to, and consistent with, the approaches of a&para;<br>number of other nations. It is consistent with the approaches set forth in the Restatement. Its insistence upon&para;<br>the presence of some distinct American interest, its reliance upon courts also invoking other related doctrines&para;<br>such as comity, exhaustion, and forum non conveniens,&para;<br>along with its dependence (for its workability) upon courts&para;<br>obtaining, and paying particular attention to, the views of&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>the Executive Branch, all should obviate the majority’s&para;<br>concern that our jurisdictional example would lead “other&para;<br>nations, also applying the law of nations,” to “hale our&para;<br>citizens into their courts for alleged violations of the law of&para;<br>nations occurring in the United States, or anywhere else&para;<br>in the world.” Ante, at 13.&para;<br>Most importantly, this jurisdictional view is consistent&para;<br>with the substantive view of the statute that we took in&para;<br>Sosa. This approach would avoid placing the statute’s&para;<br>jurisdictional scope at odds with its substantive objectives,&para;<br>holding out “the word of promise” of compensation for&para;<br>victims of the torturer, while “break[ing] it to the hope.”&para;<br>III&para;<br>Applying these jurisdictional principles to this case,&para;<br>however, I agree with the Court that jurisdiction does not&para;<br>lie. The defendants are two foreign corporations. Their&para;<br>shares, like those of many foreign corporations, are traded&para;<br>on the New York Stock Exchange. Their only presence in&para;<br>the United States consists of an office in New York City&para;<br>(actually owned by a separate but affiliated company) that&para;<br>helps to explain their business to potential investors. See&para;<br>Supp. Brief for Petitioners 4, n. 3 (citing Wiwa v. Royal&para;<br>Dutch Petroleum Co., 226 F. 3d 88, 94 (CA2 2000)); App.&para;<br>55. The plaintiffs are not United States nationals but&para;<br>nationals of other nations. The conduct at issue took place&para;<br>abroad. And the plaintiffs allege, not that the defendants&para;<br>directly engaged in acts of torture, genocide, or the equivalent, but that they helped others (who are not American&para;<br>nationals) to do so.&para;<br>Under these circumstances, even if the New York office&para;<br>were a sufficient basis for asserting general jurisdiction,&para;<br>but see Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.
