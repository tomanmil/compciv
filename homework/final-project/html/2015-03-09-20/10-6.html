Argued February 23, 2011—Decided May 31, 2011&para;<br>After respondent SEB invented an innovative deep fryer, obtained a&para;<br>U. S. patent for its design, and began selling its fryer in this country,&para;<br>Sunbeam Products, Inc., asked petitioner Pentalpha Enterprises,&para;<br>Ltd., a Hong Kong home appliance maker and wholly owned subsidi&para;<br>ary of petitioner Global-Tech Appliances, Inc., to supply Sunbeam&para;<br>with deep fryers meeting certain specifications. Pentalpha purchased&para;<br>an SEB fryer that was made for sale in a foreign market and thus&para;<br>lacked U. S. patent markings, copied all but the fryer’s cosmetic fea&para;<br>tures, and retained an attorney to conduct a right-to-use study with&para;<br>out telling him it had copied directly from SEB’s design. Failing to&para;<br>locate SEB’s patent, the attorney issued an opinion letter stating that&para;<br>Pentalpha’s deep fryer did not infringe any of the patents that he had&para;<br>found. Pentalpha then started selling its fryers to Sunbeam, which&para;<br>resold them in this country under its own trademarks at a price that&para;<br>undercut SEB’s.&para;<br>SEB then sued Sunbeam for patent infringement. Though Sun&para;<br>beam notified Pentalpha of the lawsuit, Pentalpha went on to sell its&para;<br>fryers to other companies, which resold them in the U. S. market un&para;<br>der their respective trademarks. After settling the Sunbeam lawsuit,&para;<br>SEB sued Pentalpha, asserting, as relevant here, that it had contra&para;<br>vened 35 U. S. C. §271(b) by actively inducing Sunbeam and the&para;<br>other purchasers of Pentalpha fryers to sell or offer to sell them in&para;<br>violation of SEB’s patent rights. The jury found for SEB on the in&para;<br>duced infringement theory, and the District Court entered judgment&para;<br>for SEB. Affirming, the Federal Circuit stated that induced in&para;<br>fringement under §271(b) requires a showing that the alleged in&para;<br>fringer knew or should have known that his actions would induce ac&para;<br>tual infringements; declared that this showing includes proof that the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>alleged infringer knew of the patent; held that, although there was&para;<br>no direct evidence that Pentalpha knew of SEB’s patent before it re&para;<br>ceived notice of the Sunbeam suit, there was adequate proof that it&para;<br>deliberately disregarded a known risk that SEB had a protective pat&para;<br>ent; and said that such disregard is not different from, but a form of,&para;<br>actual knowledge.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Induced infringement under §271(b) requires knowledge that the&para;<br>induced acts constitute patent infringement. Pp. 3–10.&para;<br>(a) Section 271(b)’s text—“[w]hoever actively induces infringe&para;<br>ment of a patent shall be liable as an infringer”—is ambiguous as to&para;<br>the intent needed to impose liability. In referring to a party that “in&para;<br>duces infringement,” the provision may require merely that the in&para;<br>ducer must lead another to engage in conduct that happens to&para;<br>amount to infringement. On the other hand, the reference to a party&para;<br>that “induces infringement” may also be read to mean that the in&para;<br>ducer must persuade another to engage in conduct that the inducer&para;<br>knows is infringement. Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(b) Like §271(b)’s language, the pre-1952 case law is susceptible&para;<br>to conflicting interpretations. However, Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible&para;<br>Top Replacement Co., 377 U. S. 476 (Aro II), resolves the question at&para;<br>issue. Pp. 5–8.&para;<br>(c) Induced infringement was not considered a separate theory of&para;<br>indirect liability in the pre-1952 case law, but was treated as evi&para;<br>dence of “contributory infringement,” i.e., the aiding and abetting of&para;<br>direct infringement by another party. When Congress enacted §271,&para;<br>it separated the contributory infringement concept into two catego&para;<br>ries: induced infringement, covered by §271(b), and sale of a compo&para;<br>nent of a patented invention, covered by §271(c). In the badly frac&para;<br>tured Aro II decision, a majority concluded that a violator of §271(c)&para;<br>must know “that the combination for which his component was espe&para;<br>cially designed was both patented and infringing.” 377 U. S., at 488.&para;<br>That conclusion, now a fixture in the law, compels this same knowl&para;<br>edge for liability under §271(b), given that the two provisions have a&para;<br>common origin and create the same difficult interpretive choice. Pp.&para;<br>8–10.&para;<br>2. Deliberate indifference to a known risk that a patent exists does&para;<br>not satisfy the knowledge required by §271(b). Nevertheless, the&para;<br>Federal Circuit’s judgment must be affirmed because the evidence in&para;<br>this case was plainly sufficient to support a finding of Pentalpha’s&para;<br>knowledge under the doctrine of willful blindness. Pp. 10–16.&para;<br>(a) The doctrine of willful blindness is well established in crimi&para;<br>nal law. Many criminal statutes require proof that a defendant acted&para;<br>knowingly or willfully, and courts applying the doctrine have held&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>that defendants cannot escape the reach of these statutes by deliber&para;<br>ately shielding themselves from clear evidence of critical facts that&para;<br>are strongly suggested by the circumstances. The traditional ration&para;<br>ale for the doctrine is that defendants who behave in this manner are&para;<br>just as culpable as those who have actual knowledge. This Court en&para;<br>dorsed a concept similar to willful blindness over a century ago in&para;<br>Spurr v. United States, 174 U. S. 728, 735, and every Federal Court&para;<br>of Appeals but one has fully embraced willful blindness. Given the&para;<br>doctrine's long history and wide acceptance in the Federal Judiciary,&para;<br>there is no reason why the doctrine should not apply in civil lawsuits&para;<br>for induced patent infringement under §271(b). Pp. 10–13.&para;<br>(b) Although the Courts of Appeals articulate the doctrine of will&para;<br>ful blindness in slightly different ways, all agree on two basic re&para;<br>quirements. First, the defendant must subjectively believe that there&para;<br>is a high probability that a fact exists. Second, the defendant must&para;<br>take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact. These require&para;<br>ments give willful blindness an appropriately limited scope that sur&para;<br>passes recklessness and negligence. Pp. 13–14.&para;<br>(c) Although the Federal Circuit’s test departs from the proper&para;<br>willful blindness standard in important respects, the evidence when&para;<br>viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict for SEB was suffi&para;<br>cient under the correct standard. Pentalpha believed that SEB’s&para;<br>fryer embodied advanced technology that would be valuable in the&para;<br>U. S. market as evidenced by its decision to copy all but the fryer’s&para;<br>cosmetic features. Also revealing is Pentalpha’s decision to copy an&para;<br>overseas model of SEB’s fryer, aware that it would not bear U. S.&para;<br>patent markings. Even more telling is Pentalpha’s decision not to in&para;<br>form its attorney that the product to be evaluated was simply a&para;<br>knockoff of SEB’s fryer. Taken together, the evidence was more than&para;<br>sufficient for a jury to find that Pentalpha subjectively believed there&para;<br>was a high probability that SEB’s fryer was patented and took delib&para;<br>erate steps to avoid knowing that fact, and that it therefore willfully&para;<br>blinded itself to the infringing nature of Sunbeam’s sales. Pp. 14–16.&para;<br>594 F. 3d 1360, affirmed.&para;<br>ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

S. C. §271(b) must know&para;<br>that the induced acts constitute patent infringement.&para;<br>I&para;<br>This case concerns a patent for an innovative deep fryer&para;<br>designed by respondent SEB S. A., a French maker of&para;<br>home appliances. In the late 1980’s, SEB invented a “cool­&para;<br>touch” deep fryer, that is, a deep fryer for home use with&para;<br>external surfaces that remain cool during the frying proc­&para;<br>ess. The cool-touch deep fryer consisted of a metal frying&para;<br>pot surrounded by a plastic outer housing. Attached to the&para;<br>housing was a ring that suspended the metal pot and&para;<br>insulated the housing from heat by separating it from the&para;<br>pot, creating air space between the two components. SEB&para;<br>obtained a U. S. patent for its design in 1991, and some­&para;<br>time later, SEB started manufacturing the cool-touch fryer&para;<br>and selling it in this country under its well-known “T-Fal”&para;<br>brand. Superior to other products in the American market&para;<br>at the time, SEB’s fryer was a commercial success.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>In 1997, Sunbeam Products, Inc., a U. S. competitor of&para;<br>SEB, asked petitioner Pentalpha Enterprises, Ltd., to&para;<br>supply it with deep fryers meeting certain specifications.&para;<br>Pentalpha is a Hong Kong maker of home appliances and&para;<br>a wholly owned subsidiary of petitioner Global-Tech Ap­&para;<br>pliances, Inc.1&para;<br>In order to develop a deep fryer for Sunbeam, Pentalpha&para;<br>purchased an SEB fryer in Hong Kong and copied all but&para;<br>its cosmetic features. Because the SEB fryer bought in&para;<br>Hong Kong was made for sale in a foreign market, it bore&para;<br>no U. S. patent markings. After copying SEB’s design,&para;<br>Pentalpha retained an attorney to conduct a right-to-use&para;<br>study, but Pentalpha refrained from telling the attorney&para;<br>that its design was copied directly from SEB’s.&para;<br>The attorney failed to locate SEB’s patent, and in Au­&para;<br>gust 1997 he issued an opinion letter stating that Pental­&para;<br>pha’s deep fryer did not infringe any of the patents that he&para;<br>had found. That same month, Pentalpha started selling&para;<br>its deep fryers to Sunbeam, which resold them in the&para;<br>United States under its trademarks. By obtaining its&para;<br>product from a manufacturer with lower production costs,&para;<br>Sunbeam was able to undercut SEB in the U. S. market.&para;<br>After SEB’s customers started defecting to Sunbeam,&para;<br>SEB sued Sunbeam in March 1998, alleging that Sun­&para;<br>beam’s sales infringed SEB’s patent. Sunbeam notified&para;<br>Pentalpha of the lawsuit the following month. Unde­&para;<br>terred, Pentalpha went on to sell deep fryers to Fingerhut&para;<br>Corp. and Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., both of which resold&para;<br>them in the United States under their respective trade­&para;<br>marks.&para;<br>SEB settled the lawsuit with Sunbeam, and then sued&para;<br>Pentalpha, asserting two theories of recovery: First, SEB&para;<br>claimed that Pentalpha had directly infringed SEB’s&para;<br>patent in violation of 35 U. S. C. §271(a), by selling or&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 We&para;<br>&para;<br>refer to both petitioners as “Pentalpha.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>offering to sell its deep fryers; and second, SEB claimed&para;<br>that Pentalpha had contravened §271(b) by actively induc­&para;<br>ing Sunbeam, Fingerhut, and Montgomery Ward to sell or&para;<br>to offer to sell Pentalpha’s deep fryers in violation of SEB’s&para;<br>patent rights.&para;<br>Following a 5-day trial, the jury found for SEB on both&para;<br>theories and also found that Pentalpha’s infringement had&para;<br>been willful. Pentalpha filed post-trial motions seeking&para;<br>a new trial or judgment as a matter of law on several&para;<br>grounds. As relevant here, Pentalpha argued that there&para;<br>was insufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding of&para;<br>induced infringement under §271(b) because Pentalpha&para;<br>did not actually know of SEB’s patent until it received the&para;<br>notice of the Sunbeam lawsuit in April 1998.&para;<br>The District Court rejected Pentalpha’s argument, as&para;<br>did the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which&para;<br>affirmed the judgment, SEB S. A. v. Montgomery Ward &amp;&para;<br>Co., 594 F. 3d 1360 (2010). Summarizing a recent en banc&para;<br>decision, the Federal Circuit stated that induced in­&para;<br>fringement under §271(b) requires a “plaintiff [to] show&para;<br>that the alleged infringer knew or should have known&para;<br>that his actions would induce actual infringements” and&para;<br>that this showing includes proof that the alleged infringer&para;<br>knew of the patent. Id., at 1376. Although the record&para;<br>contained no direct evidence that Pentalpha knew of&para;<br>SEB’s patent before April 1998, the court found adequate&para;<br>evidence to support a finding that “Pentalpha deliberately&para;<br>disregarded a known risk that SEB had a protective pat­&para;<br>ent.” Id., at 1377. Such disregard, the court said, “is not&para;<br>different from actual knowledge, but is a form of actual&para;<br>knowledge.” Ibid.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Pentalpha argues that active inducement liability under&para;<br>§271(b) requires more than deliberate indifference to a&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>known risk that the induced acts may violate an existing&para;<br>patent. Instead, Pentalpha maintains, actual knowledge&para;<br>of the patent is needed.&para;<br>A&para;<br>In assessing Pentalpha’s argument, we begin with the&para;<br>text of §271(b)—which is short, simple, and, with respect&para;<br>to the question presented in this case, inconclusive. Sec­&para;<br>tion 271(b) states: “Whoever actively induces infringement&para;<br>of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.”&para;<br>Although the text of §271(b) makes no mention of intent,&para;<br>we infer that at least some intent is required. The term&para;<br>“induce” means “[t]o lead on; to influence; to prevail on; to&para;<br>move by persuasion or influence.” Webster’s New Interna­&para;<br>tional Dictionary 1269 (2d ed. 1945). The addition of the&para;<br>adverb “actively” suggests that the inducement must&para;<br>involve the taking of affirmative steps to bring about the&para;<br>desired result, see id., at 27.&para;<br>When a person actively induces another to take some&para;<br>action, the inducer obviously knows the action that he or&para;<br>she wishes to bring about. If a used car salesman induces&para;<br>a customer to buy a car, the salesman knows that the&para;<br>desired result is the purchase of the car. But what if it&para;<br>is said that the salesman induced the customer to buy a&para;<br>damaged car? Does this mean merely that the salesman&para;<br>induced the customer to purchase a car that happened to&para;<br>be damaged, a fact of which the salesman may have been&para;<br>unaware? Or does this mean that the salesman knew that&para;<br>the car was damaged? The statement that the salesman&para;<br>induced the customer to buy a damaged car is ambiguous.&para;<br>So is §271(b). In referring to a party that “induces&para;<br>infringement,” this provision may require merely that the&para;<br>inducer lead another to engage in conduct that happens to&para;<br>amount to infringement, i.e., the making, using, offering to&para;<br>sell, selling, or importing of a patented invention. See&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§271(a).2 On the other hand, the reference to a party&para;<br>that “induces infringement” may also be read to mean that&para;<br>the inducer must persuade another to engage in conduct&para;<br>that the inducer knows is infringement. Both readings are&para;<br>possible.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Finding no definitive answer in the statutory text, we&para;<br>turn to the case law that predates the enactment of §271&para;<br>as part the Patent Act of 1952. As we recognized in Aro&para;<br>Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U. S. 476&para;<br>(1964) (Aro II), “[t]he section was designed to ‘codify in&para;<br>statutory form principles of contributory infringement’&para;<br>which had been ‘part of our law for about 80 years.’ ” Id.,&para;<br>at 485–486, n. 6 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 1923, 82d Cong.,&para;<br>2d Sess., 9 (1952)).&para;<br>Unfortunately, the relevant pre-1952 cases are less clear&para;<br>than one might hope with respect to the question pre­&para;<br>sented here. Before 1952, both the conduct now covered&para;<br>by §271(b) (induced infringement) and the conduct now&para;<br>addressed by §271(c) (sale of a component of a patented&para;<br>invention) were viewed as falling within the overarching&para;<br>concept of “contributory infringement.” Cases in the latter&para;<br>category—i.e., cases in which a party sold an item that&para;<br>was not itself covered by the claims of a patent but that&para;<br>enabled another party to make or use a patented machine,&para;<br>process, or combination—were more common.&para;<br>The pre-1952 case law provides conflicting signals re­&para;<br>garding the intent needed in such cases. In an oft-cited&para;<br>decision, then-Judge Taft suggested that it was sufficient&para;<br>if the seller of the component part intended that the part&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Direct infringement has long been understood to require no more&para;<br>than the unauthorized use of a patented invention. See Aro Mfg. Co. v.&para;<br>Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U. S. 476, 484 (1964); 3 A. Deller,&para;<br>Walker on Patents §453, p. 1684 (1937) (hereinafter Deller).

See Lemley, In­&para;<br>ducing Patent Infringement, 39 U. C. D. L. Rev. 225, 227&para;<br>(2005). When Congress enacted §271, it separated what&para;<br>had previously been regarded as contributory infringe­&para;<br>ment into two categories, one covered by §271(b) and the&para;<br>other covered by §271(c).&para;<br>Aro II concerned §271(c), which states in relevant part:&para;<br>“Whoever offers to sell or sells . . . a component of a&para;<br>patented [invention] . . . , constituting a material part&para;<br>of the invention, knowing the same to be especially&para;<br>made or especially adapted for use in an infringement&para;<br>of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity&para;<br>of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing&para;<br>use, shall be liable as a contributory infringer.” (Em­&para;<br>phasis added.)&para;<br>This language contains exactly the same ambiguity as&para;<br>§271(b). The phrase “knowing [a component] to be espe­&para;<br>cially made or especially adapted for use in an infringe­&para;<br>ment” may be read to mean that a violator must know&para;<br>that the component is “especially adapted for use” in a&para;<br>product that happens to infringe a patent. Or the phrase&para;<br>may be read to require, in addition, knowledge of the&para;<br>patent’s existence.&para;<br>This question closely divided the Aro II Court. In a&para;<br>badly fractured decision, a majority concluded that knowl­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

S., at 488, and n. 8;&para;<br>id., at 514 (White, J., concurring); id., at 524–527 (Black,&para;<br>J., dissenting).5 Justice Black’s opinion, which explained&para;<br>the basis for the majority’s view, concluded that the lan­&para;<br>guage of §271(c) supported this interpretation. See id., at&para;<br>525. His opinion also relied on an amendment to this&para;<br>language that was adopted when the bill was in commit­&para;<br>tee. Id., at 525–527.&para;<br>Four Justices disagreed with this interpretation and&para;<br>would have held that a violator of §271(c) need know only&para;<br>that the component is specially adapted for use in a prod­&para;<br>uct that happens to infringe a patent. See id., at 488–490,&para;<br>n. 8. These Justices thought that this reading was sup­&para;<br>ported by the language of §271(c) and the pre-1952 case&para;<br>law, and they disagreed with the inference drawn by the&para;<br>majority from the amendment of §271(c)’s language. Ibid.&para;<br>While there is much to be said in favor of both views&para;<br>expressed in Aro II, the “holding in Aro II has become&para;<br>a fixture in the law of contributory infringement under&para;<br>[section] 271(c),” 5 R. Moy, Walker on Patents §15:20,&para;<br>p. 15–131 (4th ed. 2009)—so much so that SEB has not&para;<br>asked us to overrule it, see Brief for Respondent 19, n. 3.&para;<br>Nor has Congress seen fit to alter §271(c)’s intent re­&para;<br>quirement in the nearly half a century since Aro II was&para;<br>decided. In light of the “ ‘special force’ ” of the doctrine of&para;<br>stare decisis with regard to questions of statutory inter­&para;<br>pretation, see John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States,&para;<br>552 U. S. 130, 139 (2008), we proceed on the premise that&para;<br>§271(c) requires knowledge of the existence of the patent&para;<br>that is infringed.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Although Justice Black disagreed with the judgment and was thus&para;<br>in dissent, he was in the majority with respect to the interpretation of&para;<br>§271(c), and his opinion sets out the reasoning of the majority on this&para;<br>point. Three other Justices joined his opinion, and a fourth, Justice&para;<br>White, endorsed his reasoning with respect to the interpretation of&para;<br>§271(c). See 377 U. S., at 514 (White, J., concurring).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Based on this premise, it follows that the same knowl­&para;<br>edge is needed for induced infringement under §271(b). As&para;<br>noted, the two provisions have a common origin in the pre­&para;<br>1952 understanding of contributory infringement, and the&para;<br>language of the two provisions creates the same difficult&para;<br>interpretive choice. It would thus be strange to hold that&para;<br>knowledge of the relevant patent is needed under §271(c)&para;<br>but not under §271(b).&para;<br>Accordingly, we now hold that induced infringement&para;<br>under §271(b) requires knowledge that the induced acts&para;<br>constitute patent infringement.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Returning to Pentalpha’s principal challenge, we agree&para;<br>that deliberate indifference to a known risk that a patent&para;<br>exists is not the appropriate standard under §271(b). We&para;<br>nevertheless affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals&para;<br>because the evidence in this case was plainly sufficient to&para;<br>support a finding of Pentalpha’s knowledge under the&para;<br>doctrine of willful blindness.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The doctrine of willful blindness is well established in&para;<br>criminal law. Many criminal statutes require proof that a&para;<br>defendant acted knowingly or willfully, and courts apply­&para;<br>ing the doctrine of willful blindness hold that defendants&para;<br>cannot escape the reach of these statutes by deliberately&para;<br>shielding themselves from clear evidence of critical facts&para;<br>that are strongly suggested by the circumstances. The&para;<br>traditional rationale for this doctrine is that defendants&para;<br>who behave in this manner are just as culpable as those&para;<br>who have actual knowledge. Edwards, The Criminal&para;<br>Degrees of Knowledge, 17 Mod. L. Rev. 294, 302 (1954)&para;<br>(hereinafter Edwards) (observing on the basis of English&para;<br>authorities that “up to the present day, no real doubt has&para;<br>been cast on the proposition that [willful blindness] is as&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

It is also said that per­&para;<br>sons who know enough to blind themselves to direct proof&para;<br>of critical facts in effect have actual knowledge of those&para;<br>facts. See United States v. Jewell, 532 F. 2d 697, 700 (CA9&para;<br>1976) (en banc).&para;<br>This Court’s opinion more than a century ago in Spurr&para;<br>v. United States, 174 U. S. 728 (1899),6 while not using the&para;<br>term “willful blindness,” endorsed a similar concept. The&para;<br>case involved a criminal statute that prohibited a bank&para;<br>officer from “willfully” certifying a check drawn against&para;<br>insufficient funds. We said that a willful violation would&para;<br>occur “if the [bank] officer purposely keeps himself in&para;<br>ignorance of whether the drawer has money in the bank.”&para;<br>Id., at 735.

Pentalpha knew all of this, for its CEO and&para;<br>president, John Sham, testified that, in developing a&para;<br>product for Sunbeam, Pentalpha performed “market re­&para;<br>search” and “gather[ed] information as much as possible.”&para;<br>App. 23a. Pentalpha’s belief that SEB’s fryer embodied&para;<br>advanced technology that would be valuable in the U.

Pentalpha knew that the prod­&para;<br>uct it was designing was for the U. S. market, and Sham—&para;<br>himself a named inventor on numerous U.

But this Court&para;<br>has never before held that willful blindness can substitute&para;<br>for a statutory requirement of knowledge. Spurr v. United&para;<br>States, 174 U. S. 728, 735 (1899), explained that “evil&para;<br>design may be presumed if the [bank] officer purposefully&para;<br>keeps himself in ignorance of whether the drawer has&para;<br>money in the bank or not, or is grossly indifferent to his&para;<br>duty in respect to the ascertainment of that fact.” The&para;<br>question in Spurr was whether the defendant’s admitted&para;<br>violation was willful, and with this sentence the Court&para;<br>simply explained that wrongful intent may be inferred&para;<br>from the circumstances. It did not suggest that blindness&para;<br>can substitute for knowledge. Neither did Turner v.&para;<br>United States, 396 U. S. 398 (1970), or Leary v. United&para;<br>States, 395 U. S. 6 (1969). As the Court here explains,&para;<br>both cases held only that certain statutory presumptions&para;<br>of knowledge were consistent with due process. Ante, at&para;<br>12. And although most Courts of Appeals have embraced&para;<br>willful blindness, counting courts in a circuit split is not&para;<br>this Court’s usual method for deciding important ques&para;<br>tions of law.&para;<br>The Court appears to endorse the willful blindness&para;<br>doctrine here for all federal criminal cases involving&para;<br>knowledge. It does so in a civil case where it has received&para;<br>no briefing or argument from the criminal defense bar,&para;<br>which might have provided important counsel on this&para;<br>difficult issue.&para;<br>There is no need to invoke willful blindness for the first&para;<br>time in this case. Facts that support willful blindness are&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>GLOBAL-TECH APPLIANCES, INC. v. SEB S. A.&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>often probative of actual knowledge. Circumstantial facts&para;<br>like these tend to be the only available evidence in any&para;<br>event, for the jury lacks direct access to the defendant’s&para;<br>mind. The jury must often infer knowledge from conduct,&para;<br>and attempts to eliminate evidence of knowledge may&para;<br>justify such inference, as where an accused inducer avoids&para;<br>further confirming what he already believes with good&para;<br>reason to be true. The majority’s decision to expand the&para;<br>statute’s scope appears to depend on the unstated premise&para;<br>that knowledge requires certainty, but the law often per&para;<br>mits probabilistic judgments to count as knowledge. Cf.&para;<br>Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Lathrop, 111 U. S. 612,&para;<br>620 (1884) (Harlan, J.) (“[B]eing founded on actual obser&para;<br>vation, and being consistent with common experience and&para;<br>the ordinary manifestations of the condition of the mind, it&para;<br>is knowledge, so far as the human intellect can acquire&para;<br>knowledge, upon such subjects”).&para;<br>The instant dispute provides a case in point. Pentalpha&para;<br>copied an innovative fryer. The model it copied bore no&para;<br>U. S. patent markings, but that could not have been a&para;<br>surprise, for Pentalpha knew that a fryer purchased in&para;<br>Hong Kong was unlikely to bear such markings. And&para;<br>Pentalpha failed to tell the lawyer who ran a patent&para;<br>search that it copied the SEB fryer. These facts may&para;<br>suggest knowledge that Pentalpha’s fryers were infring&para;<br>ing, and perhaps a jury could so find.&para;<br>But examining the sufficiency of the evidence presented&para;<br>in the 5-day trial requires careful review of an extensive&para;<br>record. The trial transcript alone spans over 1,000 pages.&para;<br>If willful blindness is as close to knowledge and as far&para;<br>from the “knew or should have known” jury instruction&para;<br>provided in this case as the Court suggests, then review&para;<br>ing the record becomes all the more difficult. I would&para;<br>leave that task to the Court of Appeals in the first in&para;<br>stance on remand.&para;<br>For these reasons, and with respect, I dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
