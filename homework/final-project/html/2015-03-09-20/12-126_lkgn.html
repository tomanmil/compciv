PERKINS&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SIXTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–126.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued February 25, 2013—Decided May 28, 2013&para;<br>&para;<br>Rodney Henderson was found stabbed to death after leaving a party in&para;<br>Flint, Michigan, with respondent Floyd Perkins and Damarr Jones.&para;<br>Perkins was charged with murder. Jones, the key prosecution witness, testified that Perkins alone committed the murder while Jones&para;<br>looked on. Perkins, however, testified that Jones and Henderson left&para;<br>him during the evening, and that he later saw Jones with blood on&para;<br>his clothing. Perkins was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. His conviction became final in 1997.&para;<br>The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996&para;<br>(AEDPA) gives a state prisoner one year to file a federal habeas petition, starting from “the date on which the judgment became final.”&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §2244(d)(1)(A). But if the petition alleges newly discovered evidence, the filing deadline is one year from “the date on which&para;<br>the factual predicate of the claim . . . could have been discovered&para;<br>through . . . due diligence.” §2244(d)(1)(D).&para;<br>More than 11 years after his conviction became final, Perkins filed&para;<br>his federal habeas petition, alleging, inter alia, ineffective assistance&para;<br>of trial counsel. To overcome AEDPA’s time limitations, he asserted&para;<br>newly discovered evidence of actual innocence, relying on three affidavits, the most recent dated July 16, 2002, each pointing to Jones as&para;<br>the murderer. The District Court found that, even if the affidavits&para;<br>could be characterized as evidence newly discovered, Perkins had&para;<br>failed to show diligence entitling him to equitable tolling of AEDPA’s&para;<br>limitations period. Alternatively, the court found, Perkins had not&para;<br>shown that, taking account of all the evidence, no reasonable juror&para;<br>would have convicted him. The Sixth Circuit reversed. Acknowledging that Perkins’ petition was untimely and that he had not diligently&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>pursued his rights, the court held that Perkins’ actual-innocence&para;<br>claim allowed him to present his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel&para;<br>claim as if it had been filed on time. In so ruling, the court apparently considered Perkins’ delay irrelevant to appraisal of his actualinnocence claim.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Actual innocence, if proved, serves as a gateway through which a&para;<br>petitioner may pass whether the impediment is a procedural bar, as&para;<br>it was in Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298, and House v. Bell, 547 U. S.&para;<br>518, or expiration of the AEDPA statute of limitations, as in this&para;<br>case. Pp. 7–14.&para;<br>(a) Perkins, who waited nearly six years from the date of the&para;<br>2002 affidavit to file his petition, maintains that an actual-innocence&para;<br>plea can overcome AEDPA’s one-year limitations period. This Court’s&para;<br>decisions support his view. The Court has not resolved whether a&para;<br>prisoner may be entitled to habeas relief based on a freestanding actual-innocence claim, Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 404–405, but&para;<br>it has recognized that a prisoner “otherwise subject to defenses of&para;<br>abusive or successive use of the writ may have his federal constitutional claim considered on the merits if he makes a proper showing of&para;<br>actual innocence,” id., at 404.&para;<br>The Court has applied this “fundamental miscarriage of justice exception” to overcome various procedural defaults, including, as most&para;<br>relevant here, failure to observe state procedural rules, such as filing&para;<br>deadlines. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750. The exception, the Court’s decisions bear out, survived AEDPA’s passage. See,&para;<br>e.g., Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S. 538, 558; House, 547 U. S., at&para;<br>537–538. These decisions “see[k] to balance the societal interests in&para;<br>finality, comity, and conservation of scarce judicial resources with the&para;<br>individual interest in justice that arises in the extraordinary case.”&para;<br>Schlup, 513 U. S., at 324. Sensitivity to the injustice of incarcerating&para;<br>an innocent individual should not abate when the impediment is&para;<br>AEDPA’s statute of limitations. Pp. 7–9.&para;<br>(b) The State urges that recognition of a miscarriage of justice&para;<br>exception would render §2244(d)(1)(D) superfluous. That is not so,&para;<br>for AEDPA’s time limitations apply to the typical case in which&para;<br>no actual-innocence claim is made, while the exception applies to&para;<br>a severely confined category: cases in which new evidence shows&para;<br>“it is more likely than not that ‘no reasonable juror’ would have convicted [the petitioner],” Schlup, 513 U. S., at 329. Many petitions&para;<br>that could not pass through the actual-innocence gateway will be&para;<br>timely or not measured by §2244(d)(1)(D)’s triggering provision. Nor&para;<br>does Congress’ inclusion of a miscarriage of justice exception in&para;<br>§§2244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2) indicate an intent to preclude courts&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>from applying the exception in §2244(d)(1)(D) cases. Congress did&para;<br>not simply incorporate the miscarriage of justice exception into&para;<br>§§2244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2). Rather, Congress constrained the exception’s application with respect to second-or-successive petitions&para;<br>and the holding of evidentiary hearings in federal court. The more&para;<br>rational inference to draw from the incorporation of a modified version of the exception into other provisions of AEDPA is that, in a case&para;<br>not governed by those provisions, the exception survived AEDPA’s&para;<br>passage intact and unrestricted. Pp. 9–14.&para;<br>2. A federal habeas court, faced with an actual-innocence gateway&para;<br>claim, should count unjustifiable delay on a habeas petitioner’s part,&para;<br>not as an absolute barrier to relief, but as a factor in determining&para;<br>whether actual innocence has been reliably shown. A petitioner invoking the miscarriage of justice exception “must show that it is more&para;<br>likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in&para;<br>the light of the new evidence.” Schlup, 513 U. S., at 327. Unexplained delay in presenting new evidence bears on the determination&para;<br>whether the petitioner has made the requisite showing. Taking account of the delay in the context of the merits of a petitioner’s actualinnocence claim, rather than treating timeliness as a threshold inquiry, is tuned to the exception’s underlying rationale of ensuring&para;<br>“that federal constitutional errors do not result in the incarceration of&para;<br>innocent persons.” Herrera, 506 U. S., at 404. Pp. 14–16.&para;<br>3. Here, the District Court’s appraisal of Perkins’ petition as insufficient to meet Schlup’s actual-innocence standard should be dispositive, absent cause, which this Court does not currently see, for the&para;<br>Sixth Circuit to upset that evaluation. Under Schlup’s demanding&para;<br>standard, the gateway should open only when a petition presents “evidence of innocence so strong that a court cannot have confidence in&para;<br>the outcome of the trial unless the court is also satisfied that the trial&para;<br>was free of nonharmless constitutional error.” 513 U. S., at 316.&para;<br>Pp. 16–17.&para;<br>670 F. 3d 665, vacated and remanded.&para;<br>GINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which KENNEDY,&para;<br>BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., joined.

Delo, 513 U. S.&para;<br>298 (1995), and further explained in House v. Bell, 547&para;<br>U. S. 518 (2006). In those cases, a convincing showing of&para;<br>actual innocence enabled habeas petitioners to overcome&para;<br>a procedural bar to consideration of the merits of their&para;<br>constitutional claims. Here, the question arises in the&para;<br>context of 28 U. S. C. §2244(d)(1), the statute of limitations&para;<br>on federal habeas petitions prescribed in the Antiterrorism&para;<br>and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Specifically,&para;<br>if the petitioner does not file her federal habeas petition, at the latest, within one year of “the date on which&para;<br>the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented&para;<br>could have been discovered through the exercise of due&para;<br>diligence,” §2244(d)(1)(D), can the time bar be overcome by&para;<br>a convincing showing that she committed no crime?&para;<br>We hold that actual innocence, if proved, serves as a&para;<br>gateway through which a petitioner may pass whether the&para;<br>impediment is a procedural bar, as it was in Schlup and&para;<br>House, or, as in this case, expiration of the statute of&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>limitations. We caution, however, that tenable actualinnocence gateway pleas are rare: “[A] petitioner does not&para;<br>meet the threshold requirement unless he persuades the&para;<br>district court that, in light of the new evidence, no juror,&para;<br>acting reasonably, would have voted to find him guilty&para;<br>beyond a reasonable doubt.” Schlup, 513 U. S., at 329; see&para;<br>House, 547 U. S., at 538 (emphasizing that the Schlup&para;<br>standard is “demanding” and seldom met). And in making&para;<br>an assessment of the kind Schlup envisioned, “the timing&para;<br>of the [petition]” is a factor bearing on the “reliability of&para;<br>th[e] evidence” purporting to show actual innocence.&para;<br>Schlup, 513 U. S., at 332.&para;<br>In the instant case, the Sixth Circuit acknowledged that&para;<br>habeas petitioner Perkins (respondent here) had filed his&para;<br>petition after the statute of limitations ran out, and had&para;<br>“failed to diligently pursue his rights.” Order in No. 09–&para;<br>1875, (CA6, Feb. 24, 2010), p. 2 (Certificate of Appealability). Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals reversed the&para;<br>decision of the District Court denying Perkins’ petition,&para;<br>and held that Perkins’ actual-innocence claim allowed him&para;<br>to pursue his habeas petition as if it had been filed on&para;<br>time. 670 F. 3d 665, 670 (2012). The appeals court apparently considered a petitioner’s delay irrelevant to appraisal of an actual-innocence claim. See ibid.&para;<br>We vacate the Court of Appeals’ judgment and remand&para;<br>the case. Our opinion clarifies that a federal habeas&para;<br>court, faced with an actual-innocence gateway claim, should&para;<br>count unjustifiable delay on a habeas petitioner’s part,&para;<br>not as an absolute barrier to relief, but as a factor in&para;<br>determining whether actual innocence has been reliably shown.

Henderson was&para;<br>later discovered on a wooded trail, murdered by stab&para;<br>wounds to his head.&para;<br>Perkins was charged with the murder of Henderson. At&para;<br>trial, Jones was the key witness for the prosecution. He&para;<br>testified that Perkins alone committed the murder while&para;<br>Jones looked on. App. 55.&para;<br>Chauncey Vaughn, a friend of Perkins and Henderson,&para;<br>testified that, prior to the murder, Perkins had told him&para;<br>he would kill Henderson, id., at 39, and that Perkins later&para;<br>called Vaughn, confessing to his commission of the crime.&para;<br>Id., at 36–38. A third witness, Torriano Player, also a&para;<br>friend of both Perkins and Henderson, testified that Perkins told him, had he known how Player felt about Henderson, he would not have killed Henderson. Id., at 74.&para;<br>Perkins, testifying in his own defense, offered a different&para;<br>account of the episode. He testified that he left Henderson and Jones to purchase cigarettes at a convenience store.&para;<br>When he exited the store, Perkins related, Jones and&para;<br>Henderson were gone. Id., at 84. Perkins said that he&para;<br>then visited his girlfriend. Id., at 87. About an hour later,&para;<br>Perkins recalled, he saw Jones standing under a streetlight with blood on his pants, shoes, and plaid coat. Id.,&para;<br>at 90.&para;<br>The jury convicted Perkins of first-degree murder. He&para;<br>was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of&para;<br>parole on October 27, 1993. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed Perkins’ conviction and sentence, and the&para;<br>Michigan Supreme Court denied Perkins leave to appeal&para;<br>on January 31, 1997. Perkins’ conviction became final on&para;<br>May 5, 1997.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty&para;<br>Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, a state prisoner&para;<br>ordinarily has one year to file a federal petition for habeas&para;<br>corpus, starting from “the date on which the judgment&para;<br>became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.” 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2244(d)(1)(A). If the petition alleges newly discovered&para;<br>evidence, however, the filing deadline is one year from&para;<br>“the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or&para;<br>claims presented could have been discovered through the&para;<br>exercise of due diligence.” §2244(d)(1)(D).&para;<br>Perkins filed his federal habeas corpus petition on June&para;<br>13, 2008, more than 11 years after his conviction became&para;<br>final. He alleged, inter alia, ineffective assistance on the&para;<br>part of his trial attorney, depriving him of his Sixth&para;<br>Amendment right to competent counsel. To overcome&para;<br>AEDPA’s time limitations, Perkins asserted newly discovered evidence of actual innocence. He relied on three&para;<br>affidavits, each pointing to Jones, not Perkins, as Henderson’s murderer.&para;<br>The first affidavit, dated January 30, 1997, was submitted by Perkins’ sister, Ronda Hudson. Hudson stated that&para;<br>she had heard from a third party, Louis Ford, that Jones&para;<br>bragged about stabbing Henderson and had taken his&para;<br>clothes to the cleaners after the murder. App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 54a–55a. The second affidavit, dated March 16,&para;<br>1999, was subscribed to by Demond Louis, Chauncey&para;<br>Vaughn’s younger brother. Louis stated that, on the night&para;<br>of the murder, Jones confessed to him that he had just&para;<br>killed Henderson. Louis also described the clothes Jones&para;<br>wore that night, bloodstained orange shoes and orange&para;<br>pants, and a colorful shirt. Id., at 50a–53a. The next day,&para;<br>Louis added, he accompanied Jones, first to a dumpster&para;<br>where Jones disposed of the bloodstained shoes, and then&para;<br>to the cleaners. Finally, Perkins presented the July 16,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>2002 affidavit of Linda Fleming, an employee at Pro-Clean&para;<br>Cleaners in 1993. She stated that, on or about March 4,&para;<br>1993, a man matching Jones’s description entered the&para;<br>shop and asked her whether bloodstains could be removed&para;<br>from the pants and a shirt he brought in. The pants were&para;<br>orange, she recalled, and heavily stained with blood, as&para;<br>was the multicolored shirt left for cleaning along with the&para;<br>pants. Id., at 48a–49a.&para;<br>The District Court found the affidavits insufficient to&para;<br>entitle Perkins to habeas relief. Characterizing the affidavits as newly discovered evidence was “dubious,” the&para;<br>District Court observed, in light of what Perkins knew&para;<br>about the underlying facts at the time of trial. Id., at 29a.&para;<br>But even assuming qualification of the affidavits as evidence newly discovered, the District Court next explained,&para;<br>“[Perkins’] petition [was] untimely under §2244(d)(1)(D).”&para;<br>Ibid. “[If] the statute of limitations began to run as of&para;<br>the date of the latest of th[e] affidavits, July 16, 2002,” the&para;<br>District Court noted, then “absent tolling, [Perkins] had&para;<br>until July 16, 2003 in which to file his habeas petition.”&para;<br>Ibid. Perkins, however, did not file until nearly five years&para;<br>later, on June 13, 2008.&para;<br>Under Sixth Circuit precedent, the District Court stated,&para;<br>“a habeas petitioner who demonstrates a credible claim&para;<br>of actual innocence based on new evidence may, in exceptional circumstances, be entitled to equitable tolling&para;<br>of habeas limitations.” Id., at 30a. But Perkins had not&para;<br>established exceptional circumstances, the District Court&para;<br>determined. In any event, the District Court observed,&para;<br>equitable tolling requires diligence and Perkins “ha[d]&para;<br>failed utterly to demonstrate the necessary diligence in&para;<br>exercising his rights.” Id., at 31a. Alternatively, the District Court found that Perkins had failed to meet the strict&para;<br>standard by which pleas of actual innocence are measured: He had not shown that, taking account of all&para;<br>the evidence, “it is more likely than not that no reasonable&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>juror would have convicted him,” or even that the evidence&para;<br>was new. Id., at 30a–31a.&para;<br>Perkins appealed the District Court’s judgment. Although recognizing that AEDPA’s statute of limitations&para;<br>had expired and that Perkins had not diligently pursued&para;<br>his rights, the Sixth Circuit granted a certificate of appealability limited to a single question: Is reasonable&para;<br>diligence a precondition to relying on actual innocence as a&para;<br>gateway to adjudication of a federal habeas petition on the&para;<br>merits? Certificate of Appealability 2–3.&para;<br>On consideration of the certified question, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals reversed the District Court’s judgment. Adhering&para;<br>to Circuit precedent, Souter v. Jones, 395 F. 3d 577, 597–&para;<br>602 (2005), the Sixth Circuit held that Perkins’ gateway&para;<br>actual-innocence allegations allowed him to present his&para;<br>ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim as if it were filed&para;<br>on time. On remand, the Court of Appeals instructed, “the&para;<br>[D]istrict [C]ourt [should] fully consider whether Perkins&para;<br>assert[ed] a credible claim of actual innocence.” 670 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 676.&para;<br>We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict on&para;<br>whether AEDPA’s statute of limitations can be overcome&para;<br>by a showing of actual innocence. 568 U. S. ___ (2012).&para;<br>Compare, e.g., San Martin v. McNeil, 633 F. 3d 1257,&para;<br>1267–1268 (CA11 2011) (“A court . . . may consider an&para;<br>untimely §2254 petition if, by refusing to consider the&para;<br>petition for untimeliness, the court thereby would endorse&para;<br>a ‘fundamental miscarriage of justice’ because it would&para;<br>require that an individual who is actually innocent remain&para;<br>imprisoned.”), with, e.g., Escamilla v. Jungwirth, 426&para;<br>F. 3d 868, 871–872 (CA7 2005) (“Prisoners claiming to be&para;<br>innocent, like those contending that other events spoil the&para;<br>conviction, must meet the statutory requirement of timely&para;<br>action.”). See also Rivas v. Fischer, 687 F. 3d 514, 548&para;<br>(CA2 2012) (collecting cases).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

S. ___ (2010), this Court&para;<br>addressed the circumstances in which a federal habeas&para;<br>petitioner could invoke the doctrine of “equitable tolling.”&para;<br>Holland held that “a [habeas] petitioner is entitled to&para;<br>equitable tolling only if he shows (1) that he has been&para;<br>pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely&para;<br>filing.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 16–17) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). As the courts below comprehended,&para;<br>Perkins does not qualify for equitable tolling. In possession of all three affidavits by July 2002, he waited nearly&para;<br>six years to seek federal postconviction relief. “Such a&para;<br>delay falls far short of demonstrating the . . . diligence”&para;<br>required to entitle a petitioner to equitable tolling. App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 31a (District Court opinion). See also Certificate of Appealability 2.&para;<br>Perkins, however, asserts not an excuse for filing after&para;<br>the statute of limitations has run. Instead, he maintains&para;<br>that a plea of actual innocence can overcome AEDPA’s&para;<br>one-year statute of limitations. He thus seeks an equitable exception to §2244(d)(1), not an extension of the time&para;<br>statutorily prescribed. See Rivas, 687 F. 3d, at 547, n. 42&para;<br>(distinguishing from “equitable tolling” a plea to override&para;<br>the statute of limitations when actual innocence is shown).&para;<br>Decisions of this Court support Perkins’ view of the&para;<br>significance of a convincing actual-innocence claim. We&para;<br>have not resolved whether a prisoner may be entitled to&para;<br>habeas relief based on a freestanding claim of actual&para;<br>innocence. Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 404–405&para;<br>(1993). We have recognized, however, that a prisoner&para;<br>“otherwise subject to defenses of abusive or successive use&para;<br>of the writ [of habeas corpus] may have his federal constitutional claim considered on the merits if he makes a&para;<br>proper showing of actual innocence.” Id., at 404 (citing&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333 (1992)). See also Murray&para;<br>v. Carrier, 477 U.

In other words, a credible showing of actual&para;<br>innocence may allow a prisoner to pursue his constitutional claims (here, ineffective assistance of counsel) on the&para;<br>merits notwithstanding the existence of a procedural bar&para;<br>to relief. “This rule, or fundamental miscarriage of justice&para;<br>exception, is grounded in the ‘equitable discretion’ of&para;<br>habeas courts to see that federal constitutional errors do&para;<br>not result in the incarceration of innocent persons.” Herrera, 506 U.

That is so, the State maintains,&para;<br>because AEDPA prescribes a comprehensive system for&para;<br>determining when its one-year limitations period begins to&para;<br>run. “Included within that system,” the State observes, “is&para;<br>a specific trigger for the precise circumstance presented&para;<br>here: a constitutional claim based on new evidence.” Ibid.&para;<br>Section 2244(d)(1)(D) runs the clock from “the date on&para;<br>which the factual predicate of the claim . . . could have&para;<br>been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.” In&para;<br>light of that provision, the State urges, “there is no need&para;<br>for the courts to act in equity to provide additional time for&para;<br>persons who allege actual innocence as a gateway to their&para;<br>claims of constitutional error.” Ibid. Perkins’ request for&para;<br>an equitable exception to the statute of limitations, the&para;<br>State charges, would “rende[r] superfluous this carefully&para;<br>scripted scheme.” Id., at 18.&para;<br>The State’s argument in this regard bears blinders.&para;<br>AEDPA’s time limitations apply to the typical case in&para;<br>which no allegation of actual innocence is made. The&para;<br>miscarriage of justice exception, we underscore, applies to&para;<br>a severely confined category: cases in which new evidence&para;<br>shows “it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted [the petitioner].” Schlup, 513&para;<br>U. S., at 329 (internal quotation marks omitted). Section&para;<br>2244(d)(1)(D) is both modestly more stringent (because it&para;<br>requires diligence) and dramatically less stringent (because it requires no showing of innocence). Many petitions&para;<br>that could not pass through the actual-innocence gateway&para;<br>will be timely or not measured by §2244(d)(1)(D)’s triggering provision. That provision, in short, will hardly be&para;<br>rendered superfluous by recognition of the miscarriage of&para;<br>justice exception.&para;<br>The State further relies on provisions of AEDPA other&para;<br>than §2244(d)(1)(D), namely, §§2244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)&para;<br>(2), to urge that Congress knew how to incorporate the&para;<br>miscarriage of justice exception when it was so minded.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

And §2254(e)(2), which generally bars&para;<br>evidentiary hearings in federal habeas proceedings initiated by state prisoners, includes an exception for prisoners who present new evidence of their innocence. See&para;<br>§§2254(e)(2)(A)(ii), (B) (permitting evidentiary hearings in&para;<br>federal court if “the facts underlying the claim would be&para;<br>sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence&para;<br>that but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder&para;<br>would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying&para;<br>offense”).&para;<br>But Congress did not simply incorporate the miscarriage&para;<br>of justice exception into §§2244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2).&para;<br>Rather, Congress constrained the application of the exception. Prior to AEDPA’s enactment, a court could grant&para;<br>relief on a second-or-successive petition, then known as&para;<br>an “abusive” petition, if the petitioner could show that “a&para;<br>fundamental miscarriage of justice would result from a&para;<br>failure to entertain the claim.” McCleskey, 499 U.

Section 2244(b)(2)(B) limits the exception to cases in&para;<br>which “the factual predicate for the claim could not have&para;<br>been discovered previously through the exercise of due&para;<br>diligence,” and the petitioner can establish that no reasonable factfinder “would have found [her] guilty of the&para;<br>underlying offense” by “clear and convincing evidence.”&para;<br>Congress thus required second-or-successive habeas petitioners attempting to benefit from the miscarriage of&para;<br>justice exception to meet a higher level of proof (“clear and&para;<br>convincing evidence”) and to satisfy a diligence require-&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MCQUIGGIN v.

The timing of such a petition,&para;<br>however, should seriously undermine the credibility of the&para;<br>actual-innocence claim. Moreover, the deceased witness’&para;<br>prior testimony, which would have been subject to crossexamination, could be introduced in the event of a new&para;<br>trial. See Crawford v.

Where Congress has erected a&para;<br>constitutionally valid barrier to habeas relief, a court&para;<br>cannot decline to give it effect.&para;<br>Before AEDPA, the Supreme Court had developed an&para;<br>array of doctrines, see, e.g., Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S.&para;<br>72, 87 (1977) (procedural default); McCleskey v. Zant, 499&para;<br>U. S. 467, 489 (1991) (abuse of the writ), to limit the habeas practice that it had radically expanded in the early or&para;<br>mid-20th century to include review of the merits of conviction and not merely jurisdiction of the convicting court, see&para;<br>Stone v.

Rev. 441,&para;<br>483–499 (1963). For example, the doctrine of procedural&para;<br>default holds that a state prisoner’s default of his federal&para;<br>claims “in state court pursuant to an independent and&para;<br>adequate state procedural rule” bars federal habeas review of those claims. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.&para;<br>722, 750 (1991). That doctrine is not a statutory or jurisdictional command; rather, it is a “prudential” rule&para;<br>“grounded in ‘considerations of comity and concerns for the&para;<br>orderly administration of criminal justice.’ ” Dretke v.&para;<br>Haley, 541 U. S. 386, 392–393 (2004) (quoting Francis v.&para;<br>Henderson, 425 U. S. 536, 538–539 (1976)).&para;<br>And what courts have created, courts can modify. One&para;<br>judge-made exception to procedural default allows a petitioner to proceed where he can demonstrate “cause” for the&para;<br>default and “prejudice.” See Coleman, supra, at 750. As&para;<br>relevant here, we have also expressed a willingness to&para;<br>excuse a petitioner’s default, even absent a showing of&para;<br>cause, “where a constitutional violation has probably&para;<br>resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

Where a petitioner would, but for&para;<br>a judge-made doctrine like procedural default, have a good&para;<br>habeas claim, it offends no command of Congress’s for a&para;<br>federal court to consider the petition. But that free-andeasy approach has no place where a statutory bar to habeas&para;<br>relief is at issue. “[T]he power to award the writ by any&para;<br>of the courts of the United States, must be given by written law,” Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 94 (1807) (Marshall, C.

Not one of the cases on which the Court relies&para;<br>today supports the extraordinary premise that courts can&para;<br>create out of whole cloth an exception to a statutory bar to&para;<br>relief.&para;<br>The opinion for the Court also trots out post-AEDPA&para;<br>cases to prove the irrelevant point that “[t]he miscarriage&para;<br>of justice exception . . . survived AEDPA’s passage.” Ante,&para;<br>at 8. What it ignores, yet again, is that after AEDPA’s&para;<br>passage, as before, the exception applied only to nonstatutory obstacles to relief. Bousley v. United States and&para;<br>House v. Bell were applications of the judge-made doctrine&para;<br>of procedural default. See Bousley, 523 U. S. 614, 623&para;<br>(1998); id., at 625 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and&para;<br>dissenting in part) (“I agree with the Court’s central holding . . . that none of its judge-made rules foreclose petitioner’s collateral attack . . .” (emphasis added)); id., at&para;<br>630 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); House, 547 U. S., at 522.&para;<br>Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S. 538 (1998), a nonAEDPA case, involved the courts of appeals’ “inherent&para;<br>power to recall their mandates, subject to review for an&para;<br>abuse of discretion,” id., at 549; it stands only for the&para;<br>proposition that the miscarriage-of-justice exception is an&para;<br>appropriate “ ‘means of channeling’ ” that discretion, id., at&para;<br>559 (quoting McCleskey, supra, at 496).&para;<br>The Court’s opinion, in its way, acknowledges the dearth&para;<br>of precedential support for its holding. “Prior to AEDPA,”&para;<br>it concedes, “this Court had not ruled that a credible claim&para;<br>of actual innocence could supersede a federal statute of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>limitations.” Ante, at 13, n. 2. Its explanation for this lack&para;<br>of precedent is that before AEDPA, “petitions for federal&para;<br>habeas relief were not governed by any statute of limitations.” Ibid. That is true but utterly unprobative. There&para;<br>are many statutory bars to relief other than statutes of&para;<br>limitations, and we had never (and before today, have&para;<br>never) created an actual-innocence exception to any of&para;<br>them. The reason why is obvious: Judicially amending a&para;<br>validly enacted statute in this way is a flagrant breach of&para;<br>the separation of powers.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Court has no qualms about transgressing such a&para;<br>basic principle. It does not even attempt to cloak its act of&para;<br>judicial legislation in the pretense that it is merely construing the statute; indeed, it freely admits that its opinion recognizes an “exception” that the statute does not&para;<br>contain. Ante, at 7. And it dismisses, with a series of&para;<br>transparent non sequiturs, Michigan’s overwhelming&para;<br>textual argument that the statute provides no such exception and envisions none.&para;<br>The key textual point is that two provisions of §2244,&para;<br>working in tandem, provide a comprehensive path to relief&para;<br>for an innocent prisoner who has newly discovered evidence that supports his constitutional claim. Section&para;<br>2244(d)(1)(D) gives him a fresh year in which to file, starting on “the date on which the factual predicate of the&para;<br>claim or claims presented could have been discovered&para;<br>through the exercise of due diligence,” while §2244(b)(2)(B)&para;<br>lifts the bar on second or successive petitions. Congress&para;<br>clearly anticipated the scenario of a habeas petitioner with&para;<br>a credible innocence claim and addressed it by crafting an&para;<br>exception (and an exception, by the way, more restrictive&para;<br>than the one that pleases the Court today). One cannot&para;<br>assume that Congress left room for other, judge-made&para;<br>applications of the actual-innocence exception, any more&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>than one would add another gear to a Swiss watch on the&para;<br>theory that the watchmaker surely would have included it&para;<br>if he had thought of it. In both cases, the intricate craftsmanship tells us that the designer arranged things just as&para;<br>he wanted them.&para;<br>The Court’s feeble rejoinder is that its (judicially invented) version of the “actual innocence” exception applies&para;<br>only to a “severely confined category” of cases. Ante, at 10.&para;<br>Since cases qualifying for the actual-innocence exception&para;<br>will be rare, it explains, the statutory path for innocent&para;<br>petitioners will not “be rendered superfluous.” Ibid. That&para;<br>is no answer at all. That the Court’s exception would not&para;<br>entirely frustrate Congress’s design does not weaken the&para;<br>force of the State’s argument that Congress addressed&para;<br>the issue comprehensively and chose to exclude dilatory&para;<br>prisoners like respondent. By the Court’s logic, a statute&para;<br>banning littering could simply be deemed to contain an&para;<br>exception for cigarette butts; after all, the statute as thus&para;<br>amended would still cover something. That is not how a&para;<br>court respectful of the separation of powers should interpret statutes.&para;<br>Even more bizarre is the Court’s concern that applying&para;<br>AEDPA’s statute of limitations without recognizing an&para;<br>atextual actual-innocence exception would “accord greater&para;<br>force to a federal deadline than to a similarly designed&para;<br>state deadline.” Ante, at 9; see also ante, at 13, n. 2. The&para;<br>Court terms that outcome “passing strange,” ante, at 9,&para;<br>but it is not strange at all. Only federal statutes of limitations bind federal habeas courts with the force of law;&para;<br>a state statute of limitations is given effect on federal&para;<br>habeas review only by virtue of the judge-made doctrine of&para;<br>procedural default.1 See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 730–731.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 If the Court is really troubled by this disparity, there is a way to&para;<br>resolve it that is consistent with the separation of powers: Revise our&para;<br>judge-made procedural-default doctrine to give absolute preclusive&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>With its eye firmly fixed on something it likes—a shiny&para;<br>new exception to a statute unloved in the best circles—the&para;<br>Court overlooks this basic distinction, which would not&para;<br>trouble a second-year law student armed with a copy of&para;<br>Hart &amp; Wechsler. The Court simply ignores basic legal&para;<br>principles where they pose an obstacle to its policy-driven,&para;<br>free-form improvisation.&para;<br>The Court’s statutory-construction blooper reel does&para;<br>not end there. Congress’s express inclusion of innocencebased exceptions in two neighboring provisions of the Act&para;<br>confirms, one would think, that there is no actualinnocence exception to §2244(d)(1). Section 2244(b)(2)(B),&para;<br>as already noted, lifts the bar on claims presented in&para;<br>second or successive petitions where “the factual predicate&para;<br>for the claim could not have been discovered previously&para;<br>through . . . due diligence” and “the facts underlying the&para;<br>claim . . . would be sufficient to establish by clear and&para;<br>convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no&para;<br>reasonable factfinder would have found” the petitioner&para;<br>guilty. Section 2254(e)(2) permits a district court to hold&para;<br>an evidentiary hearing where a diligent state prisoner’s&para;<br>claim relies on new facts that “would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found”&para;<br>him guilty. Ordinarily, we would draw from the express&para;<br>enumeration of these two actual-innocence exceptions the&para;<br>inference that no others were intended.&para;<br>The Court’s twisting path to the contrary conclusion is&para;<br>not easy to follow, but I will try. In the Court’s view, the&para;<br>key fact here is that these two provisions of AEDPA codified what had previously been judge-made barriers to&para;<br>relief and applied to them a stricter actual-innocence&para;<br>standard than the courts had been applying. See ante, at&para;<br>11–12. From this, the Court reasons that Congress made&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>effect to state statutes of limitations. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>a conscious choice not also to apply the more restrictive&para;<br>actual-innocence standard to the statute of limitations.&para;<br>Ergo, the Court concludes, we are free to apply the more&para;<br>lenient version of the actual-innocence exception. Ante, at&para;<br>12–13.&para;<br>That clever account ignores the background&para;<br>against which Congress legislated. Of course Congress did&para;<br>not “constrain” application of the actual-innocence exception to the statute of limitations. It felt no need to do so,&para;<br>because it had no reason whatsoever to suspect that any&para;<br>version of the exception would apply to the statute of&para;<br>limitations. The collective efforts of respondent and the&para;<br>majority have turned up not a single instance where this&para;<br>Court has applied the actual-innocence exception to any&para;<br>statutory barrier to habeas relief, much less to a statute of&para;<br>limitations. See Part I–B, supra. What has been said&para;<br>of equitable tolling applies in spades to non-tolling judicial inventions: “Congress cannot intend to incorporate, by&para;<br>silence, various forms of equitable tolling that were not&para;<br>generally recognized in the common law at the time of&para;<br>enactment.” Bain &amp; Colella, Interpreting Federal Statutes&para;<br>of Limitations, 37 Creighton L. Rev. 493, 503 (2004).&para;<br>The only conceivable relevance of §§2244(b)(2)(B) and&para;<br>2254(e)(2) is (1) as we have said, that no other actualinnocence exception was intended, and (2) that if Congress&para;<br>had anticipated that this Court would amend §2244(d)(1)&para;<br>to add an actual-innocence exception (which it surely did&para;<br>not), it would have desired the more stringent formulation&para;<br>and not the expansive formulation applied today, which it&para;<br>specifically rejected for those other provisions.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Three years ago, in Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___&para;<br>(2010), we held that AEDPA’s statute of limitations is&para;<br>subject to equitable tolling. That holding offers no support&para;<br>for importing a novel actual-innocence exception. Equitable tolling—extending the deadline for a filing because of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>an event or circumstance that deprives the filer, through&para;<br>no fault of his own, of the full period accorded by the&para;<br>statute—seeks to vindicate what might be considered the&para;<br>genuine intent of the statute. By contrast, suspending the&para;<br>statute because of a separate policy that the court believes&para;<br>should trump it (“actual innocence”) is a blatant overruling. Moreover, the doctrine of equitable tolling is centuries old, and dates from a time when the separation of&para;<br>the legislative and judicial powers was incomplete. See,&para;<br>e.g., Bree v. Holbech, 2 Doug. 655, 656 (1781) (Mansfield, J.);&para;<br>South-Sea Co. v. Wymondsell, 24 E. R. 1004, 3 P. Wms.&para;<br>143, 144 (1732); Booth v. Warrington, 2 E. R. 111, 112–&para;<br>113, 4 Bro. P. C. 163, 165–166 (1714); see also Holmberg v.&para;<br>Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 396–397 (1946); Exploration Co.&para;<br>v. United States, 247 U. S. 435, 446–447 (1918); Bailey v.&para;<br>Glover, 21 Wall. 342, 348 (1875); Sherwood v. Sutton, 21&para;<br>F. Cas. 1303, 1304–1305 (No. 12,782) (CCNH 1828) (Story,&para;<br>J.); Jones v. Conoway, 4 Yeates 109 (Pa. 1804). As Professor Manning has explained, until the Glorious Revolution&para;<br>of 1688, the Crown retained “pretensions to independent&para;<br>legislative authority, and English judges continued to&para;<br>serve as the Crown’s agents, in theory and practice a&para;<br>component of the executive. Given these conditions, which&para;<br>distinguish the old English from the American constitutional context, it is not surprising to find a similarly indistinct line between appropriate legislative and judicial&para;<br>functions in matters of interpretation.” Manning, Textualism and the Equity of the Statute, 101 Colum. L. Rev. 1,&para;<br>36–37 (2001) (footnote omitted). Thus, the doctrine of the&para;<br>equity of the statute, of which equitable tolling was an&para;<br>example, was reflected in Blackstone’s Commentaries&para;<br>“two-thirds of the way through the eighteenth century.”&para;<br>Manning, supra, at 52.&para;<br>American courts’ later adoption of the English equitabletolling practice need not be regarded as a violation of the&para;<br>separation of powers, but can be seen as a reasonable&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>assumption of genuine legislative intent. Colonial legislatures would have assumed that equitable tolling would&para;<br>attend any statute of limitations they adopted. In any&para;<br>case, equitable tolling surely represents such a reasonable&para;<br>assumption today. “It is hornbook law that limitations&para;<br>periods are customarily subject to equitable tolling, unless&para;<br>tolling would be inconsistent with the text of the relevant&para;<br>statute. Congress must be presumed to draft limitations&para;<br>periods in light of this background principle.” Young v.&para;<br>United States, 535 U. S. 43, 49–50 (2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see Manning, What&para;<br>Divides Textualists from Purposivists? 106 Colum. L. Rev.&para;<br>70, 81–82, and n. 42 (2006). Congress, being well aware of&para;<br>the longstanding background presumption of equitable&para;<br>tolling, “may provide otherwise if it wishes to do so.”&para;<br>Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 96&para;<br>(1990). The majority and dissenting opinions in Holland&para;<br>disputed whether that presumption had been overcome,&para;<br>but all agreed that the presumption existed and was a&para;<br>legitimate tool for construing statutes of limitations. See&para;<br>Holland, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13); id., at ___&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1).&para;<br>Here, by contrast, the Court has ambushed Congress&para;<br>with an utterly unprecedented (and thus unforeseeable)&para;<br>maneuver. Congressional silence, “while permitting an&para;<br>inference that Congress intended to apply ordinary background” principles, “cannot show that it intended to apply&para;<br>an unusual modification of those rules.” Meyer v. Holley,&para;<br>537 U. S. 280, 286 (2003).2 Because there is no plausible&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The Court concedes that “Congress legislates against the backdrop&para;<br>of existing law,” but protests that “[a]t the time of AEDPA’s enactment,&para;<br>multiple decisions of this Court applied the miscarriage of justice&para;<br>exception to overcome various threshold barriers to relief.” Ante, at 14,&para;<br>n. 3. That is right, of course, but only at an uninformative level of&para;<br>generality; the relevant inquiry is, to which barriers had we applied the&para;<br>exception?

Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S. 637, 647&para;<br>(1998) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>“It would be marvellously inspiring to be able to boast&para;<br>that we have a criminal-justice system in which a claim of&para;<br>‘actual innocence’ will always be heard, no matter how late&para;<br>it is brought forward, and no matter how much the failure&para;<br>to bring it forward at the proper time is the defendant’s&para;<br>own fault.” Bousley, 523 U. S., at 635 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). I suspect it is this vision of perfect justice through&para;<br>abundant procedure that impels the Court today. Of&para;<br>course, “we do not have such a system, and no society&para;<br>unwilling to devote unlimited resources to repetitive criminal litigation ever could.” Ibid. Until today, a district&para;<br>court could dismiss an untimely petition without delving&para;<br>into the underlying facts. From now on, each time an&para;<br>untimely petitioner claims innocence—and how many&para;<br>prisoners asking to be let out of jail do not?—the district&para;<br>court will be obligated to expend limited judicial resources&para;<br>wading into the murky merits of the petitioner’s innocence&para;<br>claim. The Court notes “that tenable actual-innocence&para;<br>gateway pleas are rare.” Ante, at 2. That discouraging&para;<br>reality, intended as reassurance, is in truth “the condemnation of the procedure which has encouraged frivolous&para;<br>cases.” Brown, 344 U.
