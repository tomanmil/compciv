UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 12–417.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued November 4, 2013—Decided January 27, 2014&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner Sandifer and others filed a putative collective action under&para;<br>the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, seeking backpay for time spent&para;<br>donning and doffing pieces of protective gear that they assert respondent United States Steel Corporation requires workers to wear&para;<br>because of hazards at its steel plants. U. S. Steel contends that this&para;<br>donning-and-doffing time, which would otherwise be compensable&para;<br>under the Act, is noncompensable under a provision of its collectivebargaining agreement with petitioners’ union. That provision’s validity depends on 29 U. S. C. §203(o), which allows parties to collectively&para;<br>bargain over whether “time spent in changing clothes . . . at the beginning or end of each workday” must be compensated. The District&para;<br>Court granted U. S. Steel summary judgment in pertinent part, holding that petitioners’ donning and doffing constituted “changing&para;<br>clothes” under §203(o). It also assumed that any time spent donning&para;<br>and doffing items that were not “clothes” was “de minimis” and hence&para;<br>noncompensable. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: The time petitioners spend donning and doffing their protective&para;<br>gear is not compensable by operation of §203(o). Pp. 3–15.&para;<br>(a) This Court initially construed compensability under the Fair&para;<br>Labor Standards Act expansively. See, e.g., Anderson v. Mt. Clemens&para;<br>Pottery Co., 328 U. S. 680. The Act was amended in 1949, however,&para;<br>to provide that the compensability of time spent “changing clothes or&para;<br>washing at the beginning or end of each workday” is a subject appropriately committed to collective bargaining, §203(o). Whether petitioners’ donning and doffing qualifies as “changing clothes” depends&para;<br>on the meaning of that statutory phrase. Pp. 3–6.&para;<br>(b) The term “clothes,” which is otherwise undefined, is “interpreted as taking [its] ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.” Perrin&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42. In dictionaries from the era of&para;<br>§203(o)’s enactment, “clothes” denotes items that are both designed&para;<br>and used to cover the body and are commonly regarded as articles of&para;<br>dress. Nothing in §203(o)’s text or context suggests anything other&para;<br>than this ordinary meaning. There is no basis for petitioners’ proposition that the unmodified term “clothes” somehow omits protective&para;<br>clothing. Section 203(o)’s exception applies only when the changing&para;<br>of clothes is “an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed,” Steiner v. Mitchell,&para;<br>350 U. S. 247, 256, and thus otherwise compensable under the Act.&para;<br>See 29 U. S. C. §254(a). And protective gear is the only clothing that&para;<br>is integral and indispensable to the work of many occupations, such&para;<br>as butchers and longshoremen. Petitioners’ position is also incompatible with the historical context of §203(o)’s passage, contradicting&para;<br>contemporaneous Labor Department regulations and dictum in Steiner, see 350 U. S., at 248, 254–255. The interpretation adopted here&para;<br>leaves room for distinguishing between clothes and wearable items&para;<br>that are not clothes, such as some equipment and devices. The view&para;<br>of respondent and its amici that “clothes” encompasses the entire outfit that one puts on to be ready for work is also devoid of any textual&para;<br>foundation. Pp. 6–10.&para;<br>(c) While the normal meaning of “changing clothes” connotes substitution, “changing” also carried the meaning to “alter” at the time of&para;<br>§203(o)’s enactment. The broader statutory context makes plain that&para;<br>“time spent in changing clothes” includes time spent in altering&para;<br>dress. Whether one exchanges street clothes for work clothes or&para;<br>simply chooses to layer one over the other may be a matter of purely&para;<br>personal choice, and §203(o) should not be read to allow workers to&para;<br>opt into or out of its coverage at random or at will when another&para;<br>reading is textually permissible. Pp. 10–11.&para;<br>(d) Applying these principles here, it is evident that the donning&para;<br>and doffing in this case qualifies as “changing clothes” under §203(o).&para;<br>Of the 12 items at issue, only 3—safety glasses, earplugs, and a respirator—do not fit within the elaborated interpretation of “clothes.”&para;<br>Apparently concerned that federal judges would have to separate the&para;<br>minutes spent clothes-changing and washing from the minutes devoted to other activities during the relevant period, some Courts of&para;<br>Appeals have invoked the doctrine de minimis non curat lex (the law&para;<br>does not take account of trifles). But that doctrine does not fit comfortably within this statute, which is all about trifles. A more appropriate way to proceed is for courts to ask whether the period at issue&para;<br>can, on the whole, be fairly characterized as “time spent in changing&para;<br>clothes or washing.” If an employee devotes the vast majority of that&para;<br>time to putting on and off equipment or other non-clothes items, the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>entire period would not qualify as “time spent in changing clothes”&para;<br>under §203(o), even if some clothes items were also donned and&para;<br>doffed. But if the vast majority of the time is spent in donning and&para;<br>doffing “clothes” as defined here, the entire period qualifies, and the&para;<br>time spent putting on and off other items need not be subtracted.&para;<br>Here, the Seventh Circuit agreed with the District Court’s conclusion&para;<br>that the time spent donning and doffing safety glasses and earplugs&para;<br>was minimal. And this Court is disinclined to disturb the District&para;<br>Court’s additional factual finding, not addressed by the Seventh Circuit, that the respirators were donned and doffed as needed during&para;<br>the normal workday and thus fell beyond §203(o)’s scope.

Facts and Procedural History&para;<br>Petitioner Clifton Sandifer, among others, filed suit&para;<br>under the Fair Labor Standards Act against respondent&para;<br>United States Steel Corporation in the District Court for&para;<br>the Northern District of Indiana. The plaintiffs in this&para;<br>putative collective action are a group of current or former&para;<br>employees of respondent’s steelmaking facilities.1 As&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR joins this opinion except as to footnote 7.&para;<br>1 Petitioners filed this action under 29 U. S. C. §216(b), which establishes a cause of action that may be maintained “by any one or more&para;<br>employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.” Pending resolution of the instant summaryjudgment dispute, a Magistrate Judge set aside a motion to certify the&para;<br>suit as a collective action, see No. 2:07–CV–443 RM, 2009 WL 3430222,&para;<br>*1, n. 1 (ND Ind., Oct. 15, 2009), but petitioners assert that their ranks&para;<br>are about 800 strong.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>relevant here, they seek backpay for time spent donning&para;<br>and doffing various pieces of protective gear. Petitioners&para;<br>assert that respondent requires workers to wear all of the&para;<br>items because of hazards regularly encountered in steel&para;<br>plants.&para;<br>Petitioners point specifically to 12 of what they state are&para;<br>the most common kinds of required protective gear: a&para;<br>flame-retardant jacket, pair of pants, and hood; a hardhat;&para;<br>a “snood”; “wristlets”; work gloves; leggings; “metatarsal”&para;<br>boots; safety glasses; earplugs; and a respirator.2 At bottom, petitioners want to be paid for the time they have&para;<br>spent putting on and taking off those objects. In the aggregate, the amount of time—and thus money—involved is&para;<br>likely to be quite large. Because this donning-and-doffing&para;<br>time would otherwise be compensable under the Act, U. S.&para;<br>Steel’s contention of noncompensability stands or falls&para;<br>upon the validity of a provision of its collective-bargaining&para;<br>agreement with petitioners’ union, which says that this&para;<br>time is noncompensable.3 The validity of that provision&para;<br>depends, in turn, upon the applicability of 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§203(o) to the time at issue. That subsection allows parties to decide, as part of a collective-bargaining agreement,&para;<br>that “time spent in changing clothes . . . at the beginning&para;<br>or end of each workday” is noncompensable.&para;<br>The District Court granted summary judgment in pertinent part to U.

And the&para;<br>opinion of the Court of Appeals provides a photograph of a male model&para;<br>wearing the jacket, pants, hardhat, snood, gloves, boots, and glasses.&para;<br>678 F. 3d, at 593.&para;<br>3 The District Court concluded that the collective-bargaining agreement provided that the activities at issue here were noncompensable,&para;<br>2009 WL 3430222, *10, and the Seventh Circuit upheld that conclusion,&para;<br>678 F. 3d, at 595. That issue was not among the questions on which we&para;<br>granted certiorari, and we take the import of the collective-bargaining&para;<br>agreement to be a given.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U.

No. 2:07–CV–443 RM, 2009 WL&para;<br>3430222, *4–*10 (ND Ind., Oct. 15, 2009). The District&para;<br>Court further assumed that even if certain items—the&para;<br>hardhat, glasses, and earplugs—were not “clothes,” the&para;<br>time spent donning and doffing them was “de minimis”&para;<br>and hence noncompensable. Id., at *6. The Court of&para;<br>Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld those conclusions.&para;<br>678 F. 3d 590, 593–595 (2012).4&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2013), and now&para;<br>affirm.&para;<br>II. Legal Background&para;<br>The Fair Labor Standards Act, enacted in 1938, governs&para;<br>minimum wages and maximum hours for non-exempt&para;<br>“employees who in any workweek [are] engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, or [are]&para;<br>employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the&para;<br>production of goods for commerce.” 29 U. S. C. §206(a)&para;<br>(minimum wages); §207(a) (maximum hours); see §213&para;<br>(exemptions). The Act provides that “employee” generally&para;<br>means “any individual employed by an employer,”&para;<br>§203(e)(1), and, in turn, provides that to “employ” is “to&para;<br>suffer or permit to work,” §203(g).&para;<br>The Act did not, however, define the key terms “work”&para;<br>and “workweek”—an omission that soon let loose a landslide of litigation. See IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21,&para;<br>25–26 (2005). This Court gave those terms a broad reading, culminating in its holding in Anderson v. Mt. Clemens&para;<br>Pottery Co., 328 U. S. 680 (1946), that “the statutory&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Petitioners also sought, inter alia, backpay for time spent traveling&para;<br>between the locker rooms where they don and doff at least some of the&para;<br>protective gear and their workstations. The District Court denied that&para;<br>portion of respondent’s motion for summary judgment, 2009 WL&para;<br>3430222, *11, and the Seventh Circuit reversed, 678 F. 3d, at 595–598.&para;<br>That issue is not before this Court, so we express no opinion on it.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>workweek includes all time during which an employee is&para;<br>necessarily required to be on the employer’s premises, on&para;<br>duty or at a prescribed workplace.” Id., at 690–691. That&para;<br>period, Anderson explained, encompassed time spent&para;<br>“pursu[ing] certain preliminary activities after arriving&para;<br>. . . , such as putting on aprons and overalls [and] removing shirts.” Id., at 692–693. “These activities,” the Court&para;<br>declared, “are clearly work” under the Act. Id., at 693.&para;<br>Organized labor seized on the Court’s expansive construction of compensability by filing what became known&para;<br>as “portal” actions (a reference to the “portals” or entrances to mines, at which workers put on their gear).&para;<br>“PORTAL PAY SUITS EXCEED A BILLION,” announced&para;<br>a newspaper headline in late 1946. N. Y. Times, Dec. 29,&para;<br>1946, p. 1. Stating that the Fair Labor Standards Act&para;<br>had been “interpreted judicially in disregard of longestablished customs, practices, and contracts between&para;<br>employers and employees,” Congress responded by passing&para;<br>the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 84, as amended,&para;<br>29 U. S. C. §251 et seq. (2006 ed. and Supp. V). §251(a).&para;<br>The Portal-to-Portal Act limited the scope of employers’&para;<br>liability in various ways. As relevant here, it excluded&para;<br>from mandatorily compensable time&para;<br>“activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to&para;<br>[the] principal activity or activities [that an employee&para;<br>is employed to perform], which occur either prior to&para;<br>the time on any particular workday at which such&para;<br>employee commences, or subsequent to the time on&para;<br>any particular workday at which he ceases, such principal activity or activities.” 61 Stat. 87, 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§254(a)(2).&para;<br>The Department of Labor promulgated a regulation&para;<br>explaining that the Portal-to-Portal Act did not alter what&para;<br>is known as the “continuous workday rule,” under which&para;<br>compensable time comprises “the period between the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>commencement and completion on the same workday of an&para;<br>employee’s principal activity or activities . . . [,] whether or&para;<br>not the employee engages in work throughout all of that&para;<br>period.” 12 Fed. Reg. 7658 (1947); 29 CFR §790.6(b)&para;<br>(2013). Of particular importance to this case, a Labor&para;<br>Department interpretive bulletin also specified that&para;<br>whereas “changing clothes” and “washing up or showering” “would be considered ‘preliminary’ or ‘postliminary’&para;<br>activities” when “performed outside the workday and . . .&para;<br>under the conditions normally present,” those same activities “may in certain situations be so directly related to the&para;<br>specific work the employee is employed to perform that&para;<br>[they] would be regarded as an integral part of the employee’s ‘principal activity.’ ” 12 Fed. Reg. 7659, and n. 49;&para;<br>29 CFR §790.7, and n. 49.&para;<br>In 1949, Congress amended the Fair Labor Standards&para;<br>Act to address the conduct discussed in that interpretive&para;<br>bulletin—changing clothes and washing—by adding the&para;<br>provision presently at issue:&para;<br>“Hours Worked.—In determining for the purposes of&para;<br>[the minimum-wage and maximum-hours sections] of&para;<br>this title the hours for which an employee is employed, there shall be excluded any time spent in&para;<br>changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end&para;<br>of each workday which was excluded from measured&para;<br>working time during the week involved by the express&para;<br>terms of or by custom or practice under a bona fide&para;<br>collective-bargaining agreement applicable to the particular employee.” 63 Stat. 911, 29 U. S. C. §203(o).&para;<br>Simply put, the statute provides that the compensability&para;<br>of time spent changing clothes or washing is a subject&para;<br>appropriately committed to collective bargaining.&para;<br>In Steiner v. Mitchell, 350 U. S. 247 (1956), the Court&para;<br>echoed the Labor Department’s 1947 regulations by holding that “changing clothes and showering” can, under&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>some circumstances, be considered “an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered&para;<br>workmen are employed,” reasoning that §203(o) “clear[ly]&para;<br>impli[ed]” as much. Id., at 254–256. And in IBP, we&para;<br>applied Steiner to treat as compensable the donning and&para;<br>doffing of protective gear somewhat similar to that at&para;<br>issue here, 546 U. S., at 30. We said that “any activity&para;<br>that is ‘integral and indispensable’ to a ‘principal activity’&para;<br>is itself a ‘principal activity’ ” under §254(a), id., at 37.&para;<br>As relevant to the question before us, U. S. Steel does&para;<br>not dispute the Seventh Circuit’s conclusion that “[h]ad&para;<br>the clothes-changing time in this case not been rendered&para;<br>noncompensable pursuant to [§]203(o), it would have been&para;<br>a principal activity.” 678 F. 3d, at 596. Petitioners, however, quarrel with the premise, arguing that the donning&para;<br>and doffing of protective gear does not qualify as “changing clothes.”&para;<br>III. Analysis&para;<br>A. “Clothes”&para;<br>We begin by examining the meaning of the word&para;<br>“clothes.”5 It is a “fundamental canon of statutory construction” that, “unless otherwise defined, words will be&para;<br>interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.” Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42&para;<br>(1979).&para;<br>Dictionaries from the era of §203(o)’s enactment indicate&para;<br>that “clothes” denotes items that are both designed and&para;<br>used to cover the body and are commonly regarded as&para;<br>articles of dress. See Webster’s New International Dictionary of the English Language 507 (2d ed. 1950) (Webster’s Second) (defining “clothes” as “[c]overing for the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Although&para;<br>&para;<br>the Labor Department has construed §203(o) on a number&para;<br>of occasions, the Government has expressly declined to ask us to defer&para;<br>to those interpretations, which have vacillated considerably over the&para;<br>years.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>human body; dress; vestments; vesture”); see also, e.g., 2&para;<br>Oxford English Dictionary 524 (1933) (defining “clothes”&para;<br>as “[c]overing for the person; wearing apparel; dress,&para;<br>raiment, vesture”). That is what we hold to be the meaning of the word as used in §203(o). Although a statute&para;<br>may make “a departure from the natural and popular&para;<br>acceptation of language,” Greenleaf v. Goodrich, 101 U. S.&para;<br>278, 284–285 (1880) (citing Maillard v. Lawrence, 16 How.&para;<br>251 (1854)), nothing in the text or context of §203(o) suggests anything other than the ordinary meaning of&para;<br>“clothes.”&para;<br>Petitioners argue that the word “clothes” is too indeterminate to be ascribed any general meaning but that,&para;<br>whatever it includes, it necessarily excludes items designed and used to protect against workplace hazards.&para;<br>That position creates a distinction between “protection,”&para;<br>on the one hand, and “decency or comfort,” on the other—a&para;<br>distinction that petitioners appear to have derived from&para;<br>Webster’s Second, which elaborates that “clothes” is “a&para;<br>general term for whatever covering is worn, or is made to&para;<br>be worn, for decency or comfort.” Webster’s Second 507&para;<br>(emphasis added). But that definition does not exclude,&para;<br>either explicitly or implicitly, items with a protective&para;<br>function, since “protection” and “comfort” are not incompatible, and are often synonymous. A parasol protects&para;<br>against the sun, enhancing the comfort of the bearer—just&para;<br>as work gloves protect against scrapes and cuts, enhancing the comfort of the wearer. Petitioners further assert&para;<br>that protective items of apparel are referred to as “clothing” rather than “clothes.” They point out that, when&para;<br>introduced by the adjective “protective,” the noun “clothing” is used more commonly than “clothes.” That is true&para;<br>enough, but it seems to us explained by euphonic preference rather than difference in meaning. We see no basis&para;<br>for the proposition that the unmodified term “clothes”&para;<br>somehow omits protective clothing.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioners’ proffered distinction, moreover, runs the risk&para;<br>of reducing §203(o) to near nothingness. The statutory&para;<br>compensation requirement to which §203(o) provides an&para;<br>exception embraces the changing of clothes only when that&para;<br>conduct constitutes “an integral and indispensable part of&para;<br>the principal activities for which covered workmen are&para;<br>employed.” Steiner, 350 U. S., at 256. But protective gear&para;<br>is the only clothing that is integral and indispensable to&para;<br>the work of factory workers, butchers, longshoremen, and&para;<br>a host of other occupations. Petitioners’ definition of&para;<br>“clothes” would largely limit the application of §203(o) to&para;<br>what might be called workers’ costumes, worn by such&para;<br>employees as waiters, doormen, and train conductors.&para;<br>Petitioners insist that their definition excludes only items&para;<br>with some specific work-hazard-related protective function, but that limitation essentially abandons the assertion that clothes are for decency or comfort, leaving no&para;<br>basis whatever for the distinction.&para;<br>Petitioners’ position is also incompatible with the historical context surrounding §203(o)’s passage, since it flatly&para;<br>contradicts an illustration provided by the Labor Department’s 1947 regulations to show how “changing clothes”&para;<br>could be intimately related to a principal activity. See 29&para;<br>CFR §790.7, and n. 49. Those regulations cited the situation in which “an employee in a chemical plant . . . cannot&para;<br>perform his [job] without putting on certain clothes” and&para;<br>specified that “[s]uch a situation may exist where the&para;<br>changing of clothes on the employer’s premises is required&para;<br>by law, by rules of the employer, or by the nature of the&para;<br>work.” 12 Fed. Reg. 7660, and n. 65; 29 CFR §790.8(c),&para;<br>and n. 65. And petitioners’ position contradicts this&para;<br>Court’s only prior opinion purporting to interpret §203(o).&para;<br>Steiner, announced less than a decade after the statute’s&para;<br>passage, suggested in dictum that, were there a pertinent&para;<br>provision of a collective-bargaining agreement, §203(o)&para;<br>would have applied to the facts of that case—where work-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ers “ma[d]e extensive use of dangerously caustic and toxic&para;<br>materials, and [we]re compelled by circumstances, including vital considerations of health and hygiene, to change&para;<br>clothes” on the job site. 350 U. S., at 248, 254–255.&para;<br>Petitioners contend that any attempt at a general definition of “clothes” will cast a net so vast as to capture all&para;<br>manner of marginal things—from bandoliers to barrettes&para;<br>to bandages. Yet even acknowledging that it may be&para;<br>impossible to eliminate all vagueness when interpreting a&para;<br>word as wide-ranging as “clothes,” petitioners’ fanciful&para;<br>hypotheticals give us little pause. The statutory context&para;<br>makes clear that the “clothes” referred to are items that&para;<br>are integral to job performance; the donning and doffing of&para;<br>other items would create no claim to compensation under&para;<br>the Act, and hence no need for the §203(o) exception.&para;<br>Moreover, even with respect to items that can be regarded&para;<br>as integral to job performance, our definition does not&para;<br>embrace the view, adopted by some Courts of Appeals,&para;<br>that “clothes” means essentially anything worn on the&para;<br>body—including accessories, tools, and so forth. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Salazar v. Butterball, LLC, 644 F. 3d 1130, 1139–1140&para;<br>(CA10 2011) (“clothes” are “items or garments worn by a&para;<br>person” and include “knife holders”). The construction&para;<br>we adopt today is considerably more contained. Many&para;<br>accessories—necklaces and knapsacks, for instance—are not&para;<br>“both designed and used to cover the body.” Nor are tools&para;<br>“commonly regarded as articles of dress.” Our definition&para;<br>leaves room for distinguishing between clothes and wearable items that are not clothes, such as some equipment&para;<br>and devices.6&para;<br>Respondent and its amici, by contrast, give the term in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Petitioners and their amici insist that equipment can never be&para;<br>clothes. While we do not believe that every wearable piece of equipment qualifies—for example, a wristwatch—our construction of&para;<br>“clothes” does not exclude all objects that could conceivably be characterized as equipment.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>question a capacious construction, effectively echoing the&para;<br>Courts of Appeals mentioned above.&para;<br>On this view,&para;<br>“clothes” encompasses the entire outfit that one puts on to&para;<br>be ready for work. That interpretation is, to be sure, more&para;<br>readily administrable, but it is even more devoid of a&para;<br>textual foundation than petitioners’ offering. Congress&para;<br>could have declared bargainable under §203(o) “time spent&para;<br>in changing outfits,” or “time spent in putting on and off&para;<br>all the items needed for work.” For better or worse, it used&para;<br>the narrower word “clothes.” “The role of this Court is to&para;<br>apply the statute as it is written—even if we think some&para;<br>other approach might accord with good policy.” Burrage v.&para;<br>United States, ante at 14 (internal quotation marks and&para;<br>brackets omitted).&para;<br>B. “Changing”&para;<br>Having settled upon the meaning of “clothes,” we must&para;<br>now consider the meaning of “changing.” Petitioners&para;<br>assert that when used with certain objects—such as “tire,”&para;<br>“diaper,” or, indeed, “clothes”—the term “changing” connotes&para;<br>substitution. That is undoubtedly true. See Webster’s&para;<br>Second 448 (defining “change” as “to make substitution&para;<br>of, for, or among, often among things of the same kind&para;<br>. . . ; as, to change one’s clothes”). One would not normally&para;<br>say he has changed clothes when he puts on an overcoat.&para;<br>Petitioners conclude from this that items of protective gear&para;<br>that are put on over the employee’s street clothes are not&para;<br>covered by §203(o).&para;<br>We disagree. Although it is true that the normal meaning of “changing clothes” connotes substitution, the phrase&para;<br>is certainly able to have a different import. The term&para;<br>“changing” carried two common meanings at the time of&para;<br>§203(o)’s enactment: to “substitute” and to “alter.” See,&para;<br>e.g., 2 Oxford English Dictionary 268 (defining “change,”&para;<br>among other verb forms, as “to substitute another (or&para;<br>others) for, replace by another (or others)” and “[t]o make&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(a thing) other than it was; to render different, alter,&para;<br>modify, transmute”). We think that despite the usual&para;<br>meaning of “changing clothes,” the broader statutory&para;<br>context makes it plain that “time spent in changing&para;<br>clothes” includes time spent in altering dress.&para;<br>The object of §203(o) is to permit collective bargaining&para;<br>over the compensability of clothes-changing time and to&para;<br>promote the predictability achieved through mutually&para;<br>beneficial negotiation. There can be little predictability,&para;<br>and hence little meaningful negotiation, if “changing”&para;<br>means only “substituting.” Whether one actually exchanges street clothes for work clothes or simply layers&para;<br>garments atop one another after arriving on the job site is&para;<br>often a matter of purely personal choice. That choice may&para;<br>be influenced by such happenstances and vagaries as what&para;<br>month it is, what styles are in vogue, what time the employee wakes up, what mode of transportation he uses,&para;<br>and so on. As the Fourth Circuit has put it, if the statute&para;<br>imposed a substitution requirement “compensation for&para;<br>putting on a company-issued shirt might turn on something as trivial as whether the employee did or did not&para;<br>take off the t-shirt he wore into work that day.” Sepulveda&para;<br>v. Allen Family Foods, Inc., 591 F. 3d 209, 216 (2009).&para;<br>Where another reading is textually permissible, §203(o)&para;<br>should not be read to allow workers to opt into or out of its&para;<br>coverage at random or at will.7&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 This Court has stated that “exemptions” in the Fair Labor Standards Act “are to be narrowly construed against the employers seeking to&para;<br>assert them.” Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc., 361 U. S. 388, 392 (1960).&para;<br>We need not disapprove that statement to resolve the present case.&para;<br>The exemptions from the Act generally reside in §213, which is entitled&para;<br>“Exemptions” and classifies certain kinds of workers as uncovered by&para;<br>various provisions. Thus, in Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.,&para;<br>567 U. S. ___, ___–___, n. 21 (2012) (slip op., at 19–20, n. 21), we declared the narrow-construction principle inapplicable to a provision&para;<br>appearing in §203, entitled “Definitions.”&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>C. Application&para;<br>Applying the foregoing principles to the facts of this&para;<br>case, we hold that petitioners’ donning and doffing of the&para;<br>protective gear at issue qualifies as “changing clothes”&para;<br>within the meaning of §203(o).&para;<br>Petitioners have pointed to 12 particular items: a flameretardant jacket, pair of pants, and hood; a hardhat; a&para;<br>snood; wristlets; work gloves; leggings; metatarsal boots;&para;<br>safety glasses; earplugs; and a respirator. The first nine&para;<br>clearly fit within the interpretation of “clothes” elaborated&para;<br>above: they are both designed and used to cover the body&para;<br>and are commonly regarded as articles of dress. That&para;<br>proposition is obvious with respect to the jacket, pants,&para;<br>hood, and gloves. The hardhat is simply a type of hat.&para;<br>The snood is basically a hood that also covers the neck and&para;<br>upper shoulder area; on the ski slopes, one might call it a&para;<br>“balaclava.” The wristlets are essentially detached shirtsleeves. The leggings look much like traditional legwarmers, but with straps. And the metatarsal boots—more&para;<br>commonly known as “steel-toed” boots—are just a special&para;<br>kind of shoe.&para;<br>The remaining three items, by contrast, do not satisfy&para;<br>our standard. Whereas glasses and earplugs may have a&para;<br>covering function, we do not believe that they are commonly&para;<br>regarded as articles of dress. And a respirator obviously&para;<br>falls short on both grounds. The question is whether the&para;<br>time devoted to the putting on and off of these items must&para;<br>be deducted from the noncompensable time. If so, federal&para;<br>judges must be assigned the task of separating the&para;<br>minutes spent clothes-changing and washing from the&para;<br>minutes devoted to other activities during the period in&para;<br>question.&para;<br>Some Courts of Appeals, including the Court of Appeals&para;<br>in this case, have sought to avoid, or at least mitigate, this&para;<br>difficulty by invoking the doctrine de minimis non curat&para;<br>lex (the law does not take account of trifles). This, they&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>hold, enables them to declare noncompensable a few&para;<br>minutes actually spent on something other than clotheschanging—to wit, donning and doffing non-clothes items.&para;<br>Although the roots of the de minimis doctrine stretch to&para;<br>ancient soil, its application in the present context began&para;<br>with Anderson. There, the Court declared that because&para;<br>“[s]plit-second absurdities are not justified by the actualities of working conditions or by the policy of the Fair&para;<br>Labor Standards Act,” such “trifles” as “a few seconds or&para;<br>minutes of work beyond the scheduled working hours”&para;<br>may be “disregarded.” 328 U. S., at 692. “We [thus] do not&para;<br>. . . preclude the application of a de minimis rule.” Ibid.&para;<br>We doubt that the de minimis doctrine can properly be&para;<br>applied to the present case. To be sure, Anderson included&para;<br>“putting on aprons and overalls” and “removing shirts” as&para;<br>activities to which “it is appropriate to apply a de minimis&para;<br>doctrine.” Id., at 692–693. It said that, however, in the&para;<br>context of determining what preliminary activities had to&para;<br>be counted as part of the gross workweek under §207(a) of&para;<br>the Fair Labor Standards Act.8 A de minimis doctrine&para;<br>does not fit comfortably within the statute at issue here,&para;<br>which, it can fairly be said, is all about trifles—the relatively insignificant periods of time in which employees&para;<br>wash up and put on various items of clothing needed for&para;<br>their jobs. Or to put it in the context of the present case,&para;<br>there is no more reason to disregard the minute or so&para;<br>necessary to put on glasses, earplugs, and respirators,&para;<br>than there is to regard the minute or so necessary to put&para;<br>on a snood. If the statute in question requires courts to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 We note, moreover, that even in that context, the current regulations of the Labor Department apply a stricter de minimis standard&para;<br>than Anderson expressed. They specify that “[a]n employer may not&para;<br>arbitrarily fail to count as hours worked any part, however small, of the&para;<br>employee’s fixed or regular working time or practically ascertainable&para;<br>period of time he is regularly required to spend on duties assigned to&para;<br>him.” 29 CFR §785.47.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>select among trifles, de minimis non curat lex is not Latin&para;<br>for close enough for government work.&para;<br>That said, we nonetheless agree with the basic perception of the Courts of Appeals that it is most unlikely&para;<br>Congress meant §203(o) to convert federal judges into&para;<br>time-study professionals. That is especially so since the consequence of dispensing with the intricate exercise of separating the minutes spent clothes-changing and washing from&para;<br>the minutes devoted to other activities is not to prevent&para;<br>compensation for the uncovered segments, but merely to&para;<br>leave the issue of compensation to the process of collective&para;<br>bargaining. We think it is possible to give the text of&para;<br>§203(o) a meaning that avoids such relatively inconsequential judicial involvement in “a morass of difficult, factspecific determinations,” Sepulveda, 591 F. 3d, at 218.&para;<br>The forerunner of §203(o)—the Portal-to-Portal Act&para;<br>provision whose interpretation by the Labor Department&para;<br>prompted its enactment—focused narrowly on the activities involved: “activities which are preliminary to or&para;<br>postliminary to [the employee’s] principal activity or activities.” §254(a)(2). Section 203(o), by contrast, is addressed&para;<br>not to certain “activities,” but to “time spent” on certain&para;<br>activities, viz., “changing clothes or washing.” Just as one&para;<br>can speak of “spending the day skiing” even when lessthan-negligible portions of the day are spent having lunch&para;<br>or drinking hot toddies, so also one can speak of “time&para;<br>spent changing clothes and washing” when the vast preponderance of the period in question is devoted to those&para;<br>activities. To be sure, such an imprecise and colloquial&para;<br>usage will not ordinarily be attributed to a statutory text,&para;<br>but for the reasons we have discussed we think that appropriate here. The question for courts is whether the&para;<br>period at issue can, on the whole, be fairly characterized as&para;<br>“time spent in changing clothes or washing.” If an employee devotes the vast majority of the time in question to&para;<br>putting on and off equipment or other non-clothes items&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(perhaps a diver’s suit and tank) the entire period would&para;<br>not qualify as “time spent in changing clothes” under&para;<br>§203(o), even if some clothes items were donned and doffed&para;<br>as well. But if the vast majority of the time is spent in&para;<br>donning and doffing “clothes” as we have defined that&para;<br>term, the entire period qualifies, and the time spent putting on and off other items need not be subtracted.&para;<br>In the present case, the District Court stated that “the&para;<br>time expended by each employee donning and doffing”&para;<br>safety glasses and earplugs “is minimal,” 2009 WL&para;<br>3430222, *6, a conclusion with which the Seventh Circuit&para;<br>agreed, 678 F. 3d, at 593. As for respirators, the District&para;<br>Court stated that they “are kept and put on as needed at&para;<br>job locations,” 2009 WL 3430222, *2, which would render&para;<br>the time spent donning and doffing them part of an employee’s normal workday and thus beyond the scope of&para;<br>§203(o). The Seventh Circuit did not address respirators&para;<br>at all, and we are not inclined to disturb the District&para;<br>Court’s factual conclusion.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>* &para;<br>&para;<br>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. &para;<br>&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
