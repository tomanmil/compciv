Detroit Timber &amp; Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–6925. Argued October 6, 2009—Decided March 2, 2010&para;<br>Petitioner Johnson pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition by a&para;<br>convicted felon. 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1). The Government sought sen&para;<br>tencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act, which authorizes an&para;<br>enhanced penalty for a person who violates §922(g) and who “has&para;<br>three previous convictions” for “a violent felony,” §924(e)(1), defined&para;<br>as, inter alia, an offense that “has as an element the use . . . of physi&para;<br>cal force against the person of another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(i). Among the&para;<br>three prior felony convictions the Government proffered was John&para;<br>son’s 2003 Florida conviction for simple battery, which ordinarily is a&para;<br>first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat. §784.03(1)(b), but was a felony&para;<br>conviction for Johnson because he had previously been convicted of&para;<br>another battery, Fla. Stat. §784.03(2). Under Florida law, a battery&para;<br>occurs when a person either “[a]ctually and intentionally touches or&para;<br>strikes another person against [his] will,” or “[i]ntentionally causes&para;<br>bodily harm to another person.” §784.03(1)(a). Nothing in the record&para;<br>permitted the District Court to conclude that Johnson’s 2003 convic&para;<br>tion rested upon the “strik[ing]” or “[i]ntentionally caus[ing] bodily&para;<br>harm” elements of the offense. Accordingly, his conviction was a&para;<br>predicate conviction for a “violent felony” under the Armed Career&para;<br>Criminal Act only if “[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]” another&para;<br>constitutes the use of “physical force” under §924(e)(2)(B)(i). Con&para;<br>cluding it does, the District Court enhanced Johnson’s sentence un&para;<br>der §924(e)(1), sentencing him to a term of 15 years and 5 months.&para;<br>The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: The Florida felony offense of battery by “[a]ctually and intention&para;<br>ally touch[ing]” another person does not have “as an element the use&para;<br>. . . of physical force against the person of another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(i),&para;<br>and thus does not constitute a “violent felony” under §924(e)(1).&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Pp. 3–12.&para;<br>(a) In interpreting the phrase “physical force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i),&para;<br>the Court is not bound by the Florida Supreme Court’s conclusion in&para;<br>State v. Hearns, 961 So. 2d 211, 218, that, under Florida’s statutory&para;<br>equivalent to the Armed Career Criminal Act, Fla. Stat. §775.084,&para;<br>the offense of battery does not “involve the use . . . of physical force or&para;<br>violence against any individual,” Fla. Stat. §776.08. The meaning of&para;<br>“physical force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal law, not&para;<br>state law. The Court is bound, however, by the Florida Supreme&para;<br>Court’s interpretation of the elements of the state law offense, includ&para;<br>ing the Florida Supreme Court’s holding that §784.03(1)(a)’s element&para;<br>of “[a]ctually and intentionally touching” another person is satisfied&para;<br>by any intentional physical contact, no matter how slight. Pp. 3–4.&para;<br>(b) Because §924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define “physical force,” the&para;<br>Court gives the phrase its ordinary meaning. Bailey v. United States,&para;<br>516 U. S. 137, 144–145. The adjective “physical” is clear. The noun&para;<br>“force,” however, has a number of meanings. Its ordinary meaning&para;<br>refers to the application of strength, power, and violence—in this con&para;<br>text, against another person. Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(c) The Government suggests that “force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i)’s defi&para;<br>nition of “violent felony” is a legal term of art describing one of the&para;<br>elements of the common-law crime of battery. At common law, that&para;<br>element was satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching. Al&para;<br>though a common-law term of art should be given its established&para;<br>common-law meaning, the Court does not ascribe to a statutory term&para;<br>a common-law meaning where that meaning does not fit. Here&para;<br>“physical force” is used in defining not the crime of battery, but&para;<br>rather the statutory category of “violent felony.” §924(e)(2)(B)(i). In&para;<br>that context, “physical force” means violent force—i.e., force capable&para;<br>of causing physical pain or injury to another person. Cf. Leocal v.&para;<br>Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11. Moreover, it is significant that the meaning&para;<br>the Government seeks to impute to the term “force” derives from the&para;<br>elements of a common-law misdemeanor. Nothing in the text of&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B)(i) suggests that “force” in the definition of a “violent fel&para;<br>ony” should be regarded as a common-law term of art used to define&para;<br>the contours of a misdemeanor. Nor can any negative inference&para;<br>about the amount of “force” required by §924(e)(2)(B)(i) be drawn&para;<br>from §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and §922(g)(8)(C)(ii). Pp. 5–9.&para;<br>(d) There is no force to the Government’s prediction that this deci&para;<br>sion will undermine its ability to enforce §922(g)(9)’s firearm disabil&para;<br>ity against a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of&para;<br>domestic violence that has as an element the “use . . . of physical&para;<br>force,” §921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The Court interprets the phrase “physical&para;<br>force” only in the context of a statutory definition of “violent felony,”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>and does not decide whether the same meaning applies in the context&para;<br>of defining the scope of misdemeanor offenses. Similarly misplaced is&para;<br>the Government’s assertion that it will now be more difficult to ob&para;<br>tain sentencing enhancements for individuals convicted under ge&para;<br>neric felony-battery statutes that cover both violent force and un&para;<br>wanted physical contact, and to remove an alien convicted of a&para;<br>nonviolent battery conviction under the statutory provision for an&para;<br>alien convicted of a “crime of domestic violence,” 8 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1227(a)(2)(E). See, e.g., Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___; Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 26. Pp. 9–11.&para;<br>(e) Before the District Court the Government disclaimed any reli&para;<br>ance upon the so-called “residual clause” of the definition of “violent&para;<br>felony” in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), which covers an offense that “involves&para;<br>conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to&para;<br>another.” Accordingly, the Court declines to remand for considera&para;<br>tion whether Johnson’s 2003 battery conviction qualifies as a “violent&para;<br>felony” under that provision. Pp. 11–12.&para;<br>528 F. 3d 1318, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

Stat. §784.03(1)(a), (2) (2003), “has as an element&para;<br>the use . . . of physical force against the person of an&para;<br>other,” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i), and thus constitutes a&para;<br>“violent felony” under the Armed Career Criminal Act,&para;<br>§924(e)(1).&para;<br>I&para;<br>Curtis Johnson pleaded guilty to knowingly possessing&para;<br>ammunition after having been convicted of a felony, in&para;<br>violation of 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1).&para;<br>The Government&para;<br>sought an enhanced penalty under §924(e), which provides&para;<br>that a person who violates §922(g) and who “has three&para;<br>previous convictions” for “a violent felony” “committed on&para;<br>occasions different from one another” shall be imprisoned&para;<br>for a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life. A&para;<br>“violent felony” is defined as “any crime punishable by&para;<br>imprisonment for a term exceeding one year” that:&para;<br>“(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or&para;<br>threatened use of physical force against the person of&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>another; or&para;<br>“(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of&para;<br>explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre&para;<br>sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an&para;<br>other.” §924(e)(2)(B).&para;<br>Johnson’s indictment specified five prior felony convic&para;<br>tions. The Government contended that three of those&para;<br>convictions—for aggravated battery and for burglary of a&para;<br>dwelling in October 1986, and for battery in May 2003—&para;<br>rendered Johnson eligible for sentencing under §924(e)(1).&para;<br>At the sentencing hearing, Johnson did not dispute that&para;<br>the two 1986 convictions were for “violent felon[ies],” but&para;<br>he objected to counting his 2003 battery conviction. That&para;<br>conviction was for simple battery under Florida law, which&para;<br>ordinarily is a first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat.&para;<br>§784.03(1)(b), but is a third-degree felony for a defendant&para;<br>who (like Johnson) has been convicted of battery (even&para;<br>simple battery) before, §784.03(2).&para;<br>Under §784.03(1)(a), a battery occurs when a person&para;<br>either “1. [a]ctually and intentionally touches or strikes&para;<br>another person against the will of the other,” or&para;<br>“2. [i]ntentionally causes bodily harm to another person.”&para;<br>Because the elements of the offense are disjunctive, the&para;<br>prosecution can prove a battery in one of three ways.&para;<br>State v. Hearns, 961 So. 2d 211, 218 (Fla. 2007). It can&para;<br>prove that the defendant “[i]ntentionally caus[ed] bodily&para;<br>harm,” that he “intentionally str[uck]” the victim, or that&para;<br>he merely “[a]ctually and intentionally touche[d]” the&para;<br>victim.&para;<br>Since nothing in the record of Johnson’s 2003 battery&para;<br>conviction permitted the District Court to conclude that it&para;<br>rested upon anything more than the least of these acts, see&para;<br>Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 26 (2005) (plural&para;<br>ity opinion), his conviction was a predicate conviction for a&para;<br>“violent felony” under the Armed Career Criminal Act only&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>if “[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]” another person&para;<br>constitutes the use of “physical force” within the meaning&para;<br>of §924(e)(2)(B)(i). The District Court concluded that it&para;<br>does, and accordingly sentenced Johnson under §924(e)(1)&para;<br>to a prison term of 15 years and 5 months.&para;<br>The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 528 F. 3d 1318 (2008).&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Florida has a statute similar to the Armed Career&para;<br>Criminal Act that imposes mandatory-minimum sentences&para;<br>upon “violent career criminal[s],” Fla. Stat. §775.084(4)(d)&para;<br>(2007), defined to mean persons who have three convic&para;<br>tions for certain felonies, including any “forcible felony,”&para;<br>§775.084(1)(d)(1)(a). “[F]orcible felony” is defined to in&para;<br>clude a list of enumerated felonies—including murder,&para;<br>manslaughter, sexual battery, carjacking, aggravated&para;<br>assault, and aggravated battery—and also “any other&para;<br>felony which involves the use or threat of physical force or&para;<br>violence against any individual.” §776.08. In Hearns, the&para;<br>Florida Supreme Court held that the felony offense of&para;<br>battery on a law enforcement officer, §784.07(2)(b)—which&para;<br>requires the same conduct (directed against a law en&para;<br>forcement officer) as misdemeanor battery under&para;<br>§784.03(1)(a)—was not a forcible felony. See 961 So. 2d, at&para;<br>219. It said that since §784.03(1)(a) requires proof of only&para;<br>the slightest unwanted physical touch, “the use . . . of&para;<br>physical force” was not an element of the offense. Id., at&para;<br>219.&para;<br>Johnson argues that in deciding whether any unwanted&para;<br>physical touching constitutes “physical force” under 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i), we are bound by the Florida&para;<br>Supreme Court’s conclusion in Hearns that it does not&para;<br>constitute “physical force.” That is not so. The meaning of&para;<br>“physical force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal&para;<br>law, not state law. And in answering that question we are&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>not bound by a state court’s interpretation of a similar—or&para;<br>even identical—state statute.&para;<br>We are, however, bound by the Florida Supreme Court’s&para;<br>interpretation of state law, including its determination of&para;<br>the elements of Fla. Stat. §784.03(2). See Johnson v.&para;<br>Fankell, 520 U. S. 911, 916 (1997). The Florida Supreme&para;<br>Court has held that the element of “actually and inten&para;<br>tionally touching” under Florida’s battery law is satisfied&para;<br>by any intentional physical contact, “no matter how&para;<br>slight.” Hearns, 961 So. 2d, at 218. The most “nominal&para;<br>contact,” such as a “ta[p] . . . on the shoulder without&para;<br>consent,” id., at 219, establishes a violation. We apply&para;<br>“th[is] substantive elemen[t] of the criminal offense,”&para;<br>Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 324, n. 16 (1979), in&para;<br>determining whether a felony conviction for battery under&para;<br>Fla. Stat. §784.03(2) meets the definition of “violent fel&para;<br>ony” in 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i).&para;<br>III&para;<br>Section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define “physical force,”&para;<br>and we therefore give the phrase its ordinary meaning.&para;<br>Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144–145 (1995).&para;<br>The adjective “physical” is clear in meaning but not of&para;<br>much help to our inquiry. It plainly refers to force exerted&para;<br>by and through concrete bodies—distinguishing physical&para;<br>force from, for example, intellectual force or emotional&para;<br>force. It is the noun that poses the difficulty; “force” has a&para;<br>number of meanings. For present purposes we can ex&para;<br>clude its specialized meaning in the field of physics: a&para;<br>cause of the acceleration of mass. Webster’s New Interna&para;<br>tional Dictionary 986 (2d ed. 1954) (hereinafter Webster’s&para;<br>Second). In more general usage it means “[s]trength or&para;<br>energy; active power; vigor; often an unusual degree of&para;<br>strength or energy,” “[p]ower to affect strongly in physical&para;<br>relations,” or “[p]ower, violence, compulsion, or constraint&para;<br>exerted upon a person.” Id., at 985. Black’s Law Diction&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ary 717 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black’s) defines “force”&para;<br>as “[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person&para;<br>or thing.” And it defines “physical force” as “[f]orce con&para;<br>sisting in a physical act, esp. a violent act directed against&para;<br>a robbery victim.” Ibid. All of these definitions suggest a&para;<br>degree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest&para;<br>touching.&para;<br>There is, however, a more specialized legal usage of the&para;<br>word “force”: its use in describing one of the elements of&para;<br>the common-law crime of battery, which consisted of the&para;<br>intentional application of unlawful force against the per&para;<br>son of another. See 2 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive&para;<br>Criminal Law §7.15(a), p. 301 (1986 and Supp. 2003);&para;<br>accord, Black’s 173. The common law held this element of&para;<br>“force” to be satisfied by even the slightest offensive touch&para;<br>ing. See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of&para;<br>England 120 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone); Lynch v.&para;<br>Commonwealth, 131 Va. 762, 765, 109 S. E. 427, 428&para;<br>(1921); see also 2 LaFave &amp; Scott, supra, §7.15(a). The&para;<br>question is whether the term “force” in 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B)(i) has the specialized meaning that it bore in&para;<br>the common-law definition of battery. The Government&para;<br>asserts that it does. We disagree.&para;<br>Although a common-law term of art should be given its&para;<br>established common-law meaning, United States v. Turley,&para;<br>352 U. S. 407, 411 (1957), we do not assume that a statu&para;<br>tory word is used as a term of art where that meaning&para;<br>does not fit. Ultimately, context determines meaning,&para;<br>Jarecki v. G. D. Searle &amp; Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961),&para;<br>and we “do not force term-of-art definitions into contexts&para;<br>where they plainly do not fit and produce nonsense,”&para;<br>Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 282 (2006) (SCALIA, J.,&para;<br>dissenting). Here we are interpreting the phrase “physical&para;<br>force” as used in defining not the crime of battery, but&para;<br>rather the statutory category of “violent felon[ies],”&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B). In Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1 (2004), we&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>interpreted the statutory definition of “crime of violence”&para;<br>in 18 U. S. C. §16. That provision is very similar to&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B)(i), in that it includes any felony offense&para;<br>which “has as an element the use . . . of physical force&para;<br>against the person or property of another,” §16(a). We&para;<br>stated:&para;<br>“In construing both parts of §16, we cannot forget&para;<br>that we ultimately are determining the meaning of&para;<br>the term ‘crime of violence.’ The ordinary meaning of&para;<br>this term, combined with §16’s emphasis on the use of&para;<br>physical force against another person (or the risk of&para;<br>having to use such force in committing a crime), sug&para;<br>gests a category of violent, active crimes . . . .” 543&para;<br>U. S., at 11.&para;<br>Just so here. We think it clear that in the context of a&para;<br>statutory definition of “violent felony,” the phrase “physi&para;<br>cal force” means violent force—that is, force capable of&para;<br>causing physical pain or injury to another person. See&para;<br>Flores v. Ashcroft, 350 F. 3d 666, 672 (CA7 2003) (Easter&para;<br>brook, J.).&para;<br>Even by itself, the word “violent” in&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force. Web&para;<br>ster’s Second 2846 (defining “violent” as “[m]oving, acting,&para;<br>or characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and&para;<br>sudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe;&para;<br>vehement . . .”); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed.&para;<br>1989) (“[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical&para;<br>force or strength”); Black’s 1706 (“[o]f, relating to, or char&para;<br>acterized by strong physical force”). When the adjective&para;<br>“violent” is attached to the noun “felony,” its connotation&para;<br>of strong physical force is even clearer. See id., at 1188&para;<br>(defining “violent felony” as “[a] crime characterized by&para;<br>extreme physical force, such as murder, forcible rape, and&para;<br>assault and battery with a dangerous weapon”); see also&para;<br>United States v. Doe, 960 F. 2d 221, 225 (CA1 1992)&para;<br>(Breyer, C. J.) (“[T]he term to be defined, ‘violent felony,’&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>. . . calls to mind a tradition of crimes that involve the&para;<br>possibility of more closely related, active violence”).&para;<br>It is significant, moreover, that the meaning of “physical&para;<br>force” the Government would seek to import into this&para;<br>definition of “violent felony” is a meaning derived from a&para;<br>common-law misdemeanor. At common law, battery—all&para;<br>battery, and not merely battery by the merest touching—&para;<br>was a misdemeanor, not a felony. See 4 Blackstone 216–&para;<br>218 (1769); see also 1 LaFave &amp; Scott, supra, §2.1(b), at&para;<br>90; ALI, Model Penal Code §211.1, Comment, p. 175&para;<br>(1980). As the dissent points out, post, at 5–6 (opinion of&para;<br>ALITO, J.), the dividing line between misdemeanors and&para;<br>felonies has shifted over time. But even today a simple&para;<br>battery—whether of the mere-touching or bodily-injury&para;<br>variety—generally is punishable as a misdemeanor.1 See,&para;<br>e.g., 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law §16.1(b) (2d&para;<br>ed. 2003 and Supp. 2009–2010); Cal. Penal Code Ann.&para;<br>§§242 and 243 (West 2008); Fla. Stat. §784.03(1)(b); Ill.&para;<br>Comp. Stat., ch. 720, §5/12–3(b) (West 2009); Tex. Penal&para;<br>Code Ann. §22.01(b) (West Supp. 2008). It is unlikely that&para;<br>Congress would select as a term of art defining “violent&para;<br>felony” a phrase that the common law gave peculiar mean&para;<br>ing only in its definition of a misdemeanor. Of course&para;<br>“physical force” can be given its common-law misdemeanor&para;<br>meaning by artful language, but here the only text that&para;<br>can be claimed to accomplish that is the phrase “physical&para;<br>force” itself. Since, as we have seen, that is as readily&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The dissent notes, post, at 5–6, that, around the time the Armed&para;<br>Career Criminal Act became law, in “quite a few States” it was a felony&para;<br>offense to commit an unwanted physical touching of certain victims,&para;<br>such as police officers. That would be relevant for determining whether&para;<br>a conviction under one of those statutes meets the 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B) requirement of being a “felony” conviction. But it has no&para;<br>bearing upon whether the substantive element of those offenses—&para;<br>making unwanted physical contact with certain special categories of&para;<br>individuals—involves the use of “force” within the meaning of&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B)(i), a statute applicable to all victims.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(indeed, much more readily) taken to describe violent&para;<br>force, there is no reason to define “violent felony” by refer&para;<br>ence to a nonviolent misdemeanor.&para;<br>The Government argues that we cannot construe 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i) to reach only offenses that have as&para;<br>an element the use of violent force, because there is no&para;<br>modifier in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) that specifies the degree of&para;<br>“physical force” required. As we have discussed, however,&para;<br>the term “physical force” itself normally connotes force&para;<br>strong enough to constitute “power”—and all the more so&para;<br>when it is contained in a definition of “violent felony.” Nor&para;<br>is there any merit to the dissent’s contention, post, at 4,&para;<br>that the term “force” in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) cannot be read to&para;<br>require violent force, because Congress specifically named&para;<br>“burglary” and “extortion” as “violent felon[ies]” in&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B)(ii) notwithstanding that those offenses can&para;<br>be committed without violence. The point would have&para;<br>force (so to speak) if burglary and extortion were listed in&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B)(i), as felonies that have “as an element the&para;<br>use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.”&para;<br>In fact, however, they are listed in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii), as&para;<br>examples of felonies that “presen[t] a serious potential risk&para;<br>of physical injury to another.” The Government has not&para;<br>argued that intentional, unwanted touching qualifies&para;<br>under this latter provision. What the dissent’s argument&para;<br>comes down to, then, is the contention that, since felonies&para;<br>that create a serious risk of physical injury qualify as&para;<br>violent felonies under subparagraph (B)(ii), felonies that&para;<br>involve a mere unwanted touching must involve the use of&para;<br>physical force and qualify as violent felonies under sub&para;<br>paragraph (B)(i). That obviously does not follow. 2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Even further afield is the dissent’s argument, post, at 2–3, that since&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B)(ii) requires conduct that “presents a serious potential risk&para;<br>of physical injury to another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(i) must not. That is rather&para;<br>like saying a provision which includes (i) apples and (ii) overripe&para;<br>oranges must exclude overripe apples. It does not follow.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The Government also asks us to draw a negative infer&para;<br>ence from the presence of the “bodily injury” specification&para;<br>added to the phrase “physical force” in §922(g)(8)(C)(ii).&para;<br>That provision forbids the possession of firearms by a&para;<br>person subject to a court order explicitly prohibiting the&para;<br>“use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force&para;<br>against [an] intimate partner or child that would reasona&para;<br>bly be expected to cause bodily injury.” Ibid. The absence&para;<br>of such language in §924(e)(2)(B)(i), the Government&para;<br>contends, proves that the merest touch suffices. Even as a&para;<br>matter of logic that does not follow. Specifying that&para;<br>“physical force” must rise to the level of bodily injury does&para;<br>not suggest that without the qualification “physical force”&para;<br>would consist of the merest touch. It might consist, for&para;<br>example, of only that degree of force necessary to inflict&para;<br>pain—a slap in the face, for example. Moreover, this is&para;<br>not a case where Congress has “include[d] particular&para;<br>language in one section of a statute but omit[ted] it in&para;<br>another section of the same Act,” Russello v. United States,&para;<br>464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted;&para;<br>emphasis added). Section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was enacted into&para;<br>law in 1994—eight years after enactment of the language&para;<br>in §924(e)(2)(B)(i). Compare Pub. L. 103–322, §110401,&para;<br>108 Stat. 2015 (1994), with Pub. L. 99–570, §1402, 100&para;<br>Stat. 3207–39 (1986).&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The Government contends that interpreting 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B)(i) to require violent force will undermine its&para;<br>ability to enforce the firearm disability in §922(g)(9) for&para;<br>persons who previously have been convicted of a “misde&para;<br>meanor crime of domestic violence,” which is defined to&para;<br>include certain misdemeanor offenses that have, “as an&para;<br>element, the use or attempted use of physical force . . . ,”&para;<br>§921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The prediction is unfounded. We have&para;<br>interpreted the phrase “physical force” only in the context&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of a statutory definition of “violent felony.” We do not&para;<br>decide that the phrase has the same meaning in the con&para;<br>text of defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.&para;<br>The issue is not before us, so we do not decide it.&para;<br>In a similar vein, the Government asserts that our&para;<br>interpretation will make it more difficult to remove, pur&para;<br>suant to 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a&para;<br>“crime of domestic violence.” That phrase is defined to&para;<br>mean “any crime of violence (as defined in [18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§16])” committed by certain persons, including spouses,&para;<br>former spouses, and parents. §1227(a)(2)(E)(i). The Gov&para;<br>ernment contends it will be harder to obtain removal&para;<br>based upon battery convictions that, like those in Florida,&para;<br>do not require the use of violent physical force. The dis&para;<br>sent likewise anticipates that in the States it has identi&para;<br>fied, post, at 6–7, and n. 3, as having generic felony&para;<br>battery statutes that cover both violent force and un&para;<br>wanted physical contact, our decision will render convic&para;<br>tions under those statutes “outside the scope of [the&para;<br>Armed Career Criminal Act],” post, at 8.&para;<br>This exaggerates the practical effect of our decision.&para;<br>When the law under which the defendant has been con&para;<br>victed contains statutory phrases that cover several differ&para;<br>ent generic crimes, some of which require violent force and&para;<br>some of which do not, the “ ‘modified categorical approach’ ”&para;<br>that we have approved, Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2009) (slip op., at 10), permits a court to determine&para;<br>which statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by&para;<br>consulting the trial record—including charging docu&para;<br>ments, plea agreements, transcripts of plea colloquies,&para;<br>findings of fact and conclusions of law from a bench trial,&para;<br>and jury instructions and verdict forms.

See, e.g., Shepard, supra, at 22–23&para;<br>(burglary). It is implausible that avoiding that common&para;<br>enough consequence with respect to the single crime of&para;<br>battery, under the single statute that is the Armed Career&para;<br>Criminal Act, caused Congress to import a term of art&para;<br>that is a comical misfit with the defined term “violent&para;<br>felony.”&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The Government asks us to remand to the Eleventh&para;<br>Circuit for its consideration of whether Johnson’s 2003&para;<br>battery conviction is a “violent felony” within the meaning&para;<br>of the so-called “residual clause” in 18 U.

S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added).&para;<br>The classic definition of the crime of battery is the “inten&para;<br>tional application of unlawful force against the person of&para;<br>another.” Ante, at 5 (citing 2 W.

Thus,&para;<br>the crime of battery, as traditionally defined, falls&para;<br>squarely within the plain language of ACCA. Because I&para;<br>believe that ACCA was meant to incorporate this tradi&para;<br>tional definition, I would affirm the decision of the Court&para;<br>of Appeals.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Court starts out in the right direction by noting&para;<br>that the critical statutory language—“the use, attempted&para;<br>use, or threatened use of physical force against the person&para;<br>of another,” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i)—may mean either&para;<br>(a) the use of violent force or (b) the use of force that is&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sufficient to satisfy the traditional definition of a battery.&para;<br>See ante, at 4–5. The Court veers off course, however, by&para;<br>concluding that the statutory language reaches only vio&para;<br>lent force.&para;<br>The term “force,” as the Court correctly notes, had a&para;<br>well-established meaning at common law that included&para;<br>even the “slightest offensive touching.” Ante, at 5. See&para;<br>also Respublica v. De Longchamps, 1 Dall. 111, 114 (O. T.&para;<br>Phila. 1784) (“[T]hough no great bodily pain is suffered by&para;<br>a blow on the palm of the hand, or the skirt of the coat, yet&para;<br>these are clearly within the legal d[e]finition of Assault&para;<br>and Battery. . .”); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the&para;<br>Laws of England 120, 218 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone).&para;<br>This approach recognized that an offensive but nonviolent&para;<br>touching (for example, unwanted sexual contact) may be&para;<br>even more injurious than the use of force that is sufficient&para;<br>to inflict physical pain or injury (for example, a sharp slap&para;<br>in the face).&para;<br>When Congress selects statutory language with a well&para;<br>known common-law meaning, we generally presume that&para;<br>Congress intended to adopt that meaning. See, e.g.,&para;<br>United States v. Turley, 352 U. S. 407, 411 (1957) (“We&para;<br>recognize that where a federal criminal statute uses a&para;<br>common-law term of established meaning without other&para;<br>wise defining it, the general practice is to give that term&para;<br>its common-law meaning”); Morissette v.

And here, I see nothing to suggest&para;<br>that Congress meant the phrase “use of physical force” in&para;<br>ACCA to depart from that phrase’s meaning at common&para;<br>law.&para;<br>On the contrary, other standard canons of statutory&para;<br>interpretation point to the same conclusion. “[W]here&para;<br>Congress includes particular language in one section of a&para;<br>statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it&para;<br>is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

C.&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B)(ii)—the clause immediately following the&para;<br>clause at issue in this case—the term “violent felony” is&para;<br>defined as including any crime that “involves conduct that&para;<br>presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an&para;<br>other.” (Emphasis added.) Because Congress did not&para;<br>include a similar limitation in §924(e)(2)(B)(i), we should&para;<br>presume that it did not intend for such a limitation to&para;<br>apply.&para;<br>The language used by Congress in §922(g)(8)(C)(ii)&para;<br>further illustrates this point. This provision criminalizes,&para;<br>among other things, the possession of a firearm by a per&para;<br>son who is subject to a court order that “explicitly prohib&para;<br>its the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical&para;<br>force against [an] intimate partner or child that would&para;<br>reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.” (Emphasis&para;<br>added.) Although §922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was not enacted until&para;<br>eight years after §924(e)(2)(B)(i), see ante, at 9, the former&para;<br>provision is nevertheless instructive. If Congress had&para;<br>wanted to include in §924(e)(2)(B)(i) a limitation similar to&para;<br>those in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and §922(g)(8)(C)(ii), Congress&para;<br>could have easily done so expressly.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Court provides two reasons for refusing to interpret&para;<br>18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B)(i) in accordance with the com&para;<br>mon-law understanding, but neither is persuasive.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Court first argues that §924(e)(2)(B)(i) must be read&para;<br>to refer to “violent” force because that provision defines&para;<br>the term “violent felony.” Ante, at 6. But it is apparent&para;<br>that ACCA uses “violent felony” as a term of art with a&para;<br>wider meaning than the phrase may convey in ordinary&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>usage. ACCA specifically provides that burglary and&para;<br>extortion are “violent felon[ies],” §924(e)(2)(B),(ii), and we&para;<br>have held that ACCA also reaches the crime of attempted&para;<br>burglary, James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007).&para;<br>All of these offenses may be committed without violent&para;<br>force,1 and it is therefore clear that the use of such force is&para;<br>not a requirement under ACCA. Instead, ACCA classifies&para;<br>crimes like burglary and extortion as violent felonies&para;<br>because they often lead to violence. As we have put it,&para;<br>these crimes create “significant risks of . . . confrontation&para;<br>that might result in bodily injury,” id., at 199, and offen&para;<br>sive touching creates just such a risk. For example, when&para;<br>one bar patron spits on another, violence is a likely conse&para;<br>quence. See United States v. Velazquez-Overa, 100 F. 3d&para;<br>418, 422 (CA5 1996) (“If burglary, with its tendency to&para;<br>cause alarm and to provoke physical confrontation, is&para;<br>considered a violent crime under 18 U. S. C. §16(b), then&para;<br>surely the same is true of the far greater intrusion that&para;<br>occurs when a child is sexually molested”); United States&para;<br>v. Wood, 52 F. 3d 272, 276 (CA9 1995) (same).&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 For the purposes of ACCA, burglary is defined as “an unlawful or&para;<br>unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure,&para;<br>with intent to commit a crime.” Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575,&para;<br>598 (1990). See also James, 550 U.

Although we have not&para;<br>defined extortion under ACCA, the Hobbs Act defines it as “the obtain&para;<br>ing of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use&para;<br>of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official&para;<br>right.” 18 U. S. C. §1951(b)(2) (emphasis added); see also James, supra,&para;<br>at 223–224 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (defining extortion in ACCA as “the&para;<br>obtaining of something of value from another, with his consent, induced&para;<br>by the wrongful use or threatened use of force against the person or&para;<br>property of another” (emphasis added)).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

The Court reasons that “[i]t is unlikely&para;<br>that Congress would select as a term of art defining ‘vio&para;<br>lent felony’ a phrase that the common law gave peculiar&para;<br>meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor.” Ante, at&para;<br>7 (citing 4 Blackstone 216–218 (1769), and ALI, Model&para;<br>Penal Code §211.1, Comment, p. 175 (1980)). The Court&para;<br>does not spell out why Congress’ selection of this term&para;<br>would be unlikely, but I assume that the Court’s point is&para;<br>that Congress is unlikely to have decided to treat as a&para;<br>violent felony an offense that was regarded at common law&para;<br>as a mere misdemeanor. This argument overlooks the&para;<br>significance of the misdemeanor label at common law, the&para;<br>subsequent evolution of battery statutes, and the limita&para;<br>tion imposed by 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B).&para;<br>At common law, the terms “felony” and “misdemeanor”&para;<br>did not have the same meaning as they do today. At that&para;<br>time, imprisonment as a form of punishment was rare, see&para;<br>Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 480, n. 7 (2000);&para;<br>most felonies were punishable by death, see Tennessee v.&para;<br>Garner, 471 U. S. 1, 13 (1985); and many very serious&para;<br>crimes, such as kidnaping and assault with the intent to&para;<br>murder or rape, were categorized as misdemeanors. See&para;<br>United States v. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 439–440 (1976)&para;<br>(Marshall, J., dissenting). Since that time, however, the&para;<br>term “felony” has come to mean any offense punishable by&para;<br>a lengthy term of imprisonment (commonly more than one&para;<br>year, see Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S. 124, 130&para;<br>(2008)); the term “misdemeanor” has been reserved for&para;<br>minor offenses; and many crimes that were misdemeanors&para;<br>at common law have been reclassified as felonies. And&para;<br>when the relevant language in ACCA was enacted, quite a&para;<br>few States had felony battery statutes that retained the&para;<br>common-law definition of “force.” See Fla. Stat.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>§784.07(2)(b) (1987) (making simple battery of a police&para;<br>officer a felony); Idaho Code §18–915(c) (Lexis 1987)&para;<br>(same); Ill.

S. C. §924(e)(2)(B), which provides that&para;<br>an offense committed by an adult is not a “violent felony”&para;<br>unless it is “punishable by imprisonment for a term ex&para;<br>ceeding one year.” Consequently, while all convictions&para;<br>under battery statutes that track the common-law defini&para;<br>tion of the offense satisfy the requirements of&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B)(i)—because they have “as an element the&para;<br>use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force&para;<br>against the person of another”—not all battery convictions&para;<br>qualify as convictions for a violent felony because&para;<br>§924(e)(2)(B) excludes any battery conviction that was not&para;<br>regarded by the jurisdiction of conviction as being suffi&para;<br>ciently serious to be punishable by imprisonment for more&para;<br>than one year.

UNITED STATES&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>no doubt, based on the use of violent force, the effect of the&para;<br>Court’s decision will be to take all these convictions out&para;<br>side the scope of ACCA—unless the Government is able to&para;<br>produce documents that may properly be consulted under&para;<br>the modified categorical approach and that conclusively&para;<br>show that the offender’s conduct involved the use of vio&para;<br>lent force, see ante, at 10–11. As the Government notes,&para;<br>however, this will often be impossible because, in those&para;<br>States in which the same battery provision governs both&para;<br>the use of violent force and offensive touching, charging&para;<br>documents frequently simply track the language of the&para;<br>statute, and jury instructions often do not require juries to&para;<br>draw distinctions based on the type of force that the de&para;<br>fendant employed. See Brief for United States 42–43.&para;<br>In addition, the Court’s interpretation of the term&para;<br>“physical force” may hobble at least two federal statutes&para;<br>that contain this identical term. Under 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§922(g)(9), a person convicted of a “misdemeanor crime of&para;<br>domestic violence” may not lawfully possess a firearm, and&para;<br>the term “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” is&para;<br>defined as applying only to crimes that “ha[ve], as an&para;<br>element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the&para;<br>threatened use of a deadly weapon.” §921(a)(33)(A) (em&para;<br>phasis added). As we recently explained, Congress recog&para;<br>nized that “ ‘many people who engage in serious spousal or&para;<br>child abuse ultimately are not charged with or convicted of&para;<br>felonies,’ ” and Congress therefore enacted this provision to&para;<br>keep firearms out of the hands of such abusers. United&para;<br>States v. Hayes, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10).&para;<br>Cases of spousal and child abuse are frequently prosecuted&para;<br>under generally applicable assault and battery statutes,&para;<br>ibid., and as noted, the assault and battery statutes of&para;<br>almost half the States apply both to cases involving the&para;<br>use of violent force and cases involving offensive touching.&para;<br>As a result, if the Court’s interpretation of the term&para;<br>“physical force” in ACCA is applied to §922(g)(9), a great&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>many persons convicted for serious spousal or child abuse&para;<br>will be allowed to possess firearms.&para;<br>Under 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a&para;<br>“crime of domestic violence” is subject to removal, and the&para;<br>term “crime of domestic violence” is defined as an offense&para;<br>that, among other things, has “as an element the use [or]&para;<br>attempted use . . . of physical force.” 18 U. S.
