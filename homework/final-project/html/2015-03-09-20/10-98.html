AL-KIDD&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 10–98. Argued March 2, 2011—Decided May 31, 2011&para;<br>Respondent al-Kidd alleges that, after the September 11th terrorist&para;<br>attacks, then-Attorney General Ashcroft authorized federal officials&para;<br>to detain terrorism suspects using the federal material-witness stat&para;<br>ute, 18 U. S. C. §3144. He claims that this pretextual detention pol&para;<br>icy led to his material-witness arrest as he was boarding a plane to&para;<br>Saudi Arabia. To secure the warrant, federal officials had told a&para;<br>Magistrate Judge that information “crucial” to Sami Omar alHussayen’s prosecution would be lost if al-Kidd boarded his flight.&para;<br>Prosecutors never called al-Kidd as a witness, and (as he alleges)&para;<br>never meant to do so. Al-Kidd filed suit pursuant to Bivens v. Six&para;<br>Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, challenging the con&para;<br>stitutionality of Ashcroft’s alleged policy. The District Court denied&para;<br>Ashcroft’s motion to dismiss on absolute and qualified immunity&para;<br>grounds. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment prohibits pretextual arrests absent probable cause of&para;<br>criminal wrongdoing, and that Ashcroft could not claim qualified or&para;<br>absolute immunity.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The objectively reasonable arrest and detention of a material&para;<br>witness pursuant to a validly obtained warrant cannot be challenged&para;<br>as unconstitutional on the basis of allegations that the arresting au&para;<br>thority had an improper motive. Pp. 3–9.&para;<br>(a) Qualified immunity shields a government official from money&para;<br>damages unless (1) the official violated a statutory or constitutional&para;<br>right, and (2) that right was “clearly established” at the time of the&para;<br>challenged conduct. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818.&para;<br>Where, as here, a court considers both prongs of this inquiry, this&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Court has the discretion to correct the lower court’s errors at each&para;<br>step. P. 3.&para;<br>(b) Whether a detention is reasonable under the Fourth Amend&para;<br>ment “is predominantly an objective inquiry.” Indianapolis v. Ed&para;<br>mond, 531 U. S. 32, 47. Courts ask whether “the circumstances,&para;<br>viewed objectively, justify [the challenged] action.” Scott v. United&para;<br>States, 436 U. S. 128, 138. Except for cases that involve special&para;<br>needs, e.g., Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 653, or&para;<br>administrative searches, e.g., Michigan v. Clifford, 464 U. S. 287,&para;<br>294, this Court has almost uniformly rejected invitations to probe&para;<br>subjective intent. The Court of Appeals was mistaken in believing&para;<br>that Edmond established that “ ‘programmatic purpose’ is relevant to&para;<br>Fourth Amendment analysis of programs of seizures without prob&para;<br>able cause.” 580 F. 3d 949, 968. It was not the absence of probable&para;<br>cause that triggered Edmond’s invalidating-purpose inquiry, but the&para;<br>checkpoints’ failure to be based on “individualized suspicion.” 531&para;<br>U. S., at 47. Here a neutral Magistrate Judge issued a warrant au&para;<br>thorizing al-Kidd’s arrest, and the affidavit accompanying the war&para;<br>rant application gave individualized reasons to believe that he was a&para;<br>material witness who would soon disappear. A warrant based on in&para;<br>dividualized suspicion grants more protection than existed in most of&para;<br>this Court’s cases eschewing inquiries into intent, e.g., Whren v.&para;<br>United States, 517 U. S. 806, 813, and Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 21–&para;<br>22. Al-Kidd’s contrary, narrow reading of those cases is rejected. Be&para;<br>cause he concedes that individualized suspicion supported the issu&para;<br>ance of the material-witness arrest warrant; and does not assert that&para;<br>his arrest would have been unconstitutional absent the alleged pre&para;<br>text; there is no Fourth Amendment violation here. Pp. 3–9.&para;<br>2. Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law and thus is enti&para;<br>tled to qualified immunity. A Government official’s conduct violates&para;<br>clearly established law when, at the time of the challenged conduct,&para;<br>“[t]he contours of [a] right [are] sufficiently clear” that every “reason&para;<br>able official would have understood that what he is doing violates&para;<br>that right.” Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640. Here, the as&para;<br>serted constitutional right falls far short of that threshold. At the&para;<br>time of al-Kidd’s arrest, not a single judicial opinion had held that&para;<br>pretext could render an objectively reasonable arrest pursuant to a&para;<br>material-witness warrant unconstitutional. The Ninth Circuit’s reli&para;<br>ance on a District Court’s footnoted dictum, irrelevant cases from this&para;<br>Court, and the Fourth Amendment’s broad purposes and history is&para;<br>rejected. Because Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law, the&para;<br>question whether he enjoys absolute immunity need not be ad&para;<br>dressed.

S. C. §3144. Material wit&para;<br>nesses enjoy the same constitutional right to pretrial&para;<br>release as other federal detainees, and federal law re&para;<br>quires release if their testimony “can adequately be&para;<br>secured by deposition, and if further detention is not nec&para;<br>essary to prevent a failure of justice.” Ibid.&para;<br>Because this case arises from a motion to dismiss, we&para;<br>accept as true the factual allegations in Abdullah al-Kidd’s&para;<br>complaint. The complaint alleges that, in the aftermath of&para;<br>the September 11th terrorist attacks, then-Attorney Gen&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>eral John Ashcroft authorized federal prosecutors and law&para;<br>enforcement officials to use the material-witness statute to&para;<br>detain individuals with suspected ties to terrorist organi&para;<br>zations. It is alleged that federal officials had no intention&para;<br>of calling most of these individuals as witnesses, and that&para;<br>they were detained, at Ashcroft’s direction, because fed&para;<br>eral officials suspected them of supporting terrorism but&para;<br>lacked sufficient evidence to charge them with a crime.&para;<br>It is alleged that this pretextual detention policy led&para;<br>to the material-witness arrest of al-Kidd, a native-born&para;<br>United States citizen. FBI agents apprehended him in&para;<br>March 2003 as he checked in for a flight to Saudi Arabia.&para;<br>Two days earlier, federal officials had informed a Magis&para;<br>trate Judge that, if al-Kidd boarded his flight, they be&para;<br>lieved information “crucial” to the prosecution of Sami&para;<br>Omar al-Hussayen would be lost. App. 64. Al-Kidd re&para;<br>mained in federal custody for 16 days and on supervised&para;<br>release until al-Hussayen’s trial concluded 14 months&para;<br>later. Prosecutors never called him as a witness.&para;<br>In March 2005, al-Kidd filed this Bivens action, see&para;<br>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S.&para;<br>388 (1971) to challenge the constitutionality of Ashcroft’s&para;<br>alleged policy; he also asserted several other claims not&para;<br>relevant here against Ashcroft and others. Ashcroft filed a&para;<br>motion to dismiss based on absolute and qualified immu&para;<br>nity, which the District Court denied. A divided panel of&para;<br>the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit&para;<br>affirmed, holding that the Fourth Amendment prohibits&para;<br>pretextual arrests absent probable cause of criminal&para;<br>wrongdoing, and that Ashcroft could not claim qualified or&para;<br>absolute immunity. See 580 F. 3d 949 (2009).&para;<br>Judge Bea dissented, 580 F. 3d, at 981, and eight judges&para;<br>dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, see 598&para;<br>F. 3d 1129, 1137, 1142 (CA9 2010). We granted certiorari,&para;<br>see 562 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011) &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>Qualified immunity shields federal and state officials&para;<br>from money damages unless a plaintiff pleads facts show&para;<br>ing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitu&para;<br>tional right, and (2) that the right was “clearly estab&para;<br>lished” at the time of the challenged conduct. Harlow v.&para;<br>Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982). We recently reaf&para;<br>firmed that lower courts have discretion to decide which of&para;<br>the two prongs of qualified-immunity analysis to tackle&para;<br>first. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 236 (2009).&para;<br>Courts should think carefully before expending “scarce&para;<br>judicial resources” to resolve difficult and novel questions&para;<br>of constitutional or statutory interpretation that will “have&para;<br>no effect on the outcome of the case.” Id., at 236–237; see&para;<br>id., at 237–242. When, however, a Court of Appeals does&para;<br>address both prongs of qualified-immunity analysis, we&para;<br>have discretion to correct its errors at each step. Although&para;<br>not necessary to reverse an erroneous judgment, doing so&para;<br>ensures that courts do not insulate constitutional deci&para;<br>sions at the frontiers of the law from our review or inad&para;<br>vertently undermine the values qualified immunity seeks&para;<br>to promote. The former occurs when the constitutional&para;<br>law question is wrongly decided; the latter when what is&para;<br>not clearly established is held to be so. In this case, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals’ analysis at both steps of the qualified&para;<br>immunity inquiry needs correction.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Fourth Amendment protects “[t]he right of the&para;<br>people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and&para;<br>effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” An&para;<br>arrest, of course, qualifies as a “seizure” of a “person”&para;<br>under this provision, Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200,&para;<br>207–208 (1979), and so must be reasonable under the&para;<br>circumstances. Al-Kidd does not assert that Government&para;<br>officials would have acted unreasonably if they had used a&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>material-witness warrant to arrest him for the purpose of&para;<br>securing his testimony for trial. See Brief for Respondent&para;<br>16–17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 20–22. He contests, however (and&para;<br>the Court of Appeals here rejected), the reasonableness of&para;<br>using the warrant to detain him as a suspected criminal.&para;<br>Fourth Amendment reasonableness “is predominantly&para;<br>an objective inquiry.” Edmond, supra, at 47. We ask&para;<br>whether “the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify&para;<br>[the challenged] action.” Scott v. United States, 436 U. S.&para;<br>128, 138 (1978). If so, that action was reasonable “what&para;<br>ever the subjective intent” motivating the relevant offi&para;<br>cials. Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 806, 814 (1996).&para;<br>This approach recognizes that the Fourth Amendment&para;<br>regulates conduct rather than thoughts, Bond v. United&para;<br>States, 529 U. S. 334, 338, n. 2 (2000); and it promotes&para;<br>evenhanded, uniform enforcement of the law, Devenpeck v.&para;<br>Alford, 543 U. S. 146, 153–154 (2004).&para;<br>Two “limited exception[s]” to this rule are our special&para;<br>needs and administrative-search cases, where “actual&para;<br>motivations” do matter. United States v. Knights, 534&para;<br>U. S. 112, 122 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>A judicial warrant and probable cause are not needed&para;<br>where the search or seizure is justified by “special needs,&para;<br>beyond the normal need for law enforcement,” such as the&para;<br>need to deter drug use in public schools, Vernonia School&para;<br>Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 653 (1995) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted), or the need to assure that&para;<br>railroad employees engaged in train operations are not&para;<br>under the influence of drugs or alcohol, Skinner v. Railway&para;<br>Labor Executives’ Assn., 489 U. S. 602 (1989); and where&para;<br>the search or seizure is in execution of an administrative&para;<br>warrant authorizing, for example, an inspection of fire&para;<br>damaged premises to determine the cause, Michigan v.&para;<br>Clifford, 464 U. S. 287, 294 (1984) (plurality opinion), or&para;<br>an inspection of residential premises to assure compliance&para;<br>with a housing code, Camara v. Municipal Court of City&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and County of San Francisco, 387 U. S. 523, 535–538&para;<br>(1967). But those exceptions do not apply where the offi&para;<br>cer’s purpose is not to attend to the special needs or to the&para;<br>investigation for which the administrative inspection is&para;<br>justified. See Whren, supra, at 811–812. The Government&para;<br>seeks to justify the present arrest on the basis of a prop&para;<br>erly issued judicial warrant—so that the special-needs and&para;<br>administrative-inspection cases cannot be the basis for a&para;<br>purpose inquiry here.&para;<br>Apart from those cases, we have almost uniformly re&para;<br>jected invitations to probe subjective intent. See Brigham&para;<br>City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 404 (2006). There is one&para;<br>category of exception, upon which the Court of Appeals&para;<br>principally relied. In Edmond, 531 U. S. 32, we held that&para;<br>the Fourth Amendment could not condone suspicionless&para;<br>vehicle checkpoints set up for the purpose of detecting&para;<br>illegal narcotics. Although we had previously approved&para;<br>vehicle checkpoints set up for the purpose of keeping off&para;<br>the road unlicensed drivers, Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S.&para;<br>648, 663 (1979), or alcohol-impaired drivers, Michigan&para;<br>Dept. of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U. S. 444 (1990); and for&para;<br>the purpose of interdicting those who illegally cross the&para;<br>border, United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543&para;<br>(1976); we found the drug-detection purpose in Edmond&para;<br>invalidating because it was “ultimately indistinguishable&para;<br>from the general interest in crime control,” 531 U. S., at&para;<br>44. In the Court of Appeals’ view, Edmond established&para;<br>that “ ‘programmatic purpose’ is relevant to Fourth&para;<br>Amendment analysis of programs of seizures without&para;<br>probable cause.” 580 F. 3d, at 968.&para;<br>That was mistaken. It was not the absence of probable&para;<br>cause that triggered the invalidating-purpose inquiry in&para;<br>Edmond. To the contrary, Edmond explicitly said that it&para;<br>would approve checkpoint stops for “general crime control&para;<br>purposes” that were based upon merely “some quantum of&para;<br>individualized suspicion.” 531 U. S., at 47. Purpose was&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>relevant in Edmond because “programmatic purposes may&para;<br>be relevant to the validity of Fourth Amendment intru&para;<br>sions undertaken pursuant to a general scheme without&para;<br>individualized suspicion,” id., at 45–46 (emphasis added).1&para;<br>Needless to say, warrantless, “suspicionless intrusions&para;<br>pursuant to a general scheme,” id., at 47, are far removed&para;<br>from the facts of this case. A warrant issued by a neutral&para;<br>Magistrate Judge authorized al-Kidd’s arrest. The affida&para;<br>vit accompanying the warrant application (as al-Kidd&para;<br>concedes) gave individualized reasons to believe that he&para;<br>was a material witness and that he would soon disappear.&para;<br>The existence of a judicial warrant based on individualized&para;<br>suspicion takes this case outside the domain of not only&para;<br>our special-needs and administrative-search cases, but of&para;<br>Edmond as well.&para;<br>A warrant based on individualized suspicion2 in fact&para;<br>grants more protection against the malevolent and the&para;<br>incompetent than existed in most of our cases eschewing&para;<br>inquiries into intent. In Whren, 517 U. S., at 813, and&para;<br>Devenpeck, 543 U. S., at 153, we declined to probe the&para;<br>motives behind seizures supported by probable cause but&para;<br>lacking a warrant approved by a detached magistrate.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The Court of Appeals also relied upon Ferguson v. Charleston, 532&para;<br>U. S. 67 (2001), which held unconstitutional a program of mandatory&para;<br>drug testing of maternity patients. Like Edmond, that case involved a&para;<br>general scheme of searches without individualized suspicion. 532 U. S.,&para;<br>at 77, n. 10.&para;<br>2 JUSTICE GINSBURG suggests that our use of the word “suspicion” is&para;<br>peculiar because that word “ordinarily” means “that the person sus&para;<br>pected has engaged in wrongdoing.” Post, at 3, n. 2 (opinion concurring&para;<br>in judgment). We disagree. No usage of the word is more common and&para;<br>idiomatic than a statement such as “I have a suspicion he knows&para;<br>something about the crime,” or even “I have a suspicion she is throwing&para;<br>me a surprise birthday party.” The many cases cited by JUSTICE&para;<br>GINSBURG, post, at 3, n. 2, which use the neutral word “suspicion” in&para;<br>connection with wrongdoing, prove nothing except that searches and&para;<br>seizures for reasons other than suspected wrongdoing are rare.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 21–22 (1968), and Knights, 534&para;<br>U. S., at 121–122, applied an objective standard to war&para;<br>rantless searches justified by a lesser showing of reason&para;<br>able suspicion.&para;<br>We review even some suspicionless&para;<br>searches for objective reasonableness. See Bond, 529&para;<br>U. S., at 335–336, 338, n. 2. If concerns about improper&para;<br>motives and pretext do not justify subjective inquiries in&para;<br>those less protective contexts, we see no reason to adopt&para;<br>that inquiry here.&para;<br>Al-Kidd would read our cases more narrowly. He as&para;<br>serts that Whren establishes that we ignore subjective&para;<br>intent only when there exists “probable cause to believe&para;<br>that a violation of law has occurred,” 517 U. S., at 811—&para;<br>which was not the case here. That is a distortion of Whren.&para;<br>Our unanimous opinion held that we would not look&para;<br>behind an objectively reasonable traffic stop to determine&para;<br>whether racial profiling or a desire to investigate other&para;<br>potential crimes was the real motive. See id., at 810, 813.&para;<br>In the course of our analysis, we dismissed Whren’s&para;<br>reliance on our inventory-search and administrative&para;<br>inspection cases by explaining that those cases do not&para;<br>“endors[e] the principle that ulterior motives can invali&para;<br>date police conduct that is justifiable on the basis of prob&para;<br>able cause to believe that a violation of law has occurred,”&para;<br>id., at 811 But to say that ulterior motives do not in&para;<br>validate a search that is legitimate because of probable&para;<br>cause to believe a crime has occurred is not to say that it&para;<br>does invalidate all searches that are legitimate for other&para;<br>reasons.&para;<br>“[O]nly an undiscerning reader,” ibid., would think&para;<br>otherwise. We referred to probable cause to believe that a&para;<br>violation of law had occurred because that was the legiti&para;<br>mating factor in the case at hand. But the analysis of&para;<br>our opinion swept broadly to reject inquiries into motive&para;<br>generally. See id., at 812–815. We remarked that our&para;<br>special-needs and administrative-inspection cases are un&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>usual in their concern for pretext, and do nothing more&para;<br>than “explain that the exemption from the need for prob&para;<br>able cause (and warrant), which is accorded to searches&para;<br>made for the purpose of inventory or administrative regu&para;<br>lation, is not accorded to searches that are not made for&para;<br>those purposes,” id., at 811–812. And our opinion empha&para;<br>sized that we had at that time (prior to Edmond) rejected&para;<br>every request to examine subjective intent outside the&para;<br>narrow context of special needs and administrative inspec&para;<br>tions. See 517 U. S., at 812. Thus, al-Kidd’s approach&para;<br>adds an “only” to a sentence plucked from the Whren&para;<br>opinion, and then elevates that sentence (as so revised)&para;<br>over the remainder of the opinion, and over the consistent&para;<br>holdings of our other cases.&para;<br>Because al-Kidd concedes that individualized suspicion&para;<br>supported the issuance of the material-witness arrest&para;<br>warrant; and does not assert that his arrest would have&para;<br>been unconstitutional absent the alleged pretextual use of&para;<br>the warrant; we find no Fourth Amendment violation.3&para;<br>Efficient4 and evenhanded application of the law demands&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>concerns of JUSTICES GINSBURG and SOTOMAYOR about the valid&para;<br>ity of the warrant in this case are beside the point. See post, at 1–2&para;<br>(GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment); post, at 2 (SOTOMAYOR, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment). The validity of the warrant is not our “open&para;<br>ing assumption,” post, at 2 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment); it is&para;<br>the premise of al-Kidd’s argument. Al-Kidd does not claim that&para;<br>Ashcroft is liable because the FBI agents failed to obtain a valid war&para;<br>rant. He takes the validity of the warrant as a given, and argues that&para;<br>his arrest nevertheless violated the Constitution because it was moti&para;<br>vated by an illegitimate purpose. His separate Fourth Amendment and&para;<br>statutory claims against the FBI agents who sought the material&para;<br>witness warrant, which are the focus of both concurrences, are not&para;<br>before us.&para;<br>4 We may note in passing that al-Kidd alleges that the Attorney Gen&para;<br>eral authorized the use of material-witness warrants for detention of&para;<br>suspected terrorists, but not that he forbade the use of those warrants&para;<br>to detain material witnesses. Which means that if al-Kidd’s inquiry&para;<br>into actual motive is accepted, mere determination that the Attorney&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

Creigh&para;<br>ton, 483 U. S. 635, 640 (1987). We do not require a case&para;<br>directly on point, but existing precedent must have placed&para;<br>the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.&para;<br>See ibid.; Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 341 (1986). The&para;<br>constitutional question in this case falls far short of that&para;<br>threshold.&para;<br>At the time of al-Kidd’s arrest, not a single judicial&para;<br>opinion had held that pretext could render an objectively&para;<br>reasonable arrest pursuant to a material-witness warrant&para;<br>unconstitutional. A district-court opinion had suggested,&para;<br>in a footnoted dictum devoid of supporting citation, that&para;<br>using such a warrant for preventive detention of suspects&para;<br>“is an illegitimate use of the statute”—implying (we accept&para;<br>for the sake of argument) that the detention would there&para;<br>fore be unconstitutional. United States v. Awadallah, 202&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 55, 77, n. 28 (SDNY 2002). The Court of&para;<br>Appeals thought nothing could “have given John Ashcroft&para;<br>fair[er] warning” that his conduct violated the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment, because the footnoted dictum “call[ed] out&para;<br>Ashcroft by name”! 580 F. 3d, at 972–973 (internal quota&para;<br>tion marks omitted; emphasis added). We will indulge the&para;<br>assumption (though it does not seem to us realistic) that&para;<br>Justice Department lawyers bring to the Attorney Gen&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>General promulgated the alleged policy would not alone decide the case. &para;<br>&para;<br>Al-Kidd would also have to prove that the officials who sought his &para;<br>&para;<br>material-arrest warrant were motivated by Ashcroft’s policy, not by a&para;<br>&para;<br>desire to call al-Kidd as a witness. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>eral’s personal attention all district judges’ footnoted&para;<br>speculations that boldly “call him out by name.” On that&para;<br>assumption, would it prove that for him (and for him&para;<br>only?) it became clearly established that pretextual use of&para;<br>the material-witness statute rendered the arrest unconsti&para;<br>tutional? An extraordinary proposition. Even a district&para;<br>judge’s ipse dixit of a holding is not “controlling authority”&para;<br>in any jurisdiction, much less in the entire United States;&para;<br>and his ipse dixit of a footnoted dictum falls far short of&para;<br>what is necessary absent controlling authority: a robust&para;<br>“consensus of cases of persuasive authority.” Wilson v.&para;<br>Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 617 (1999).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals’ other cases “clearly establishing”&para;<br>the constitutional violation are, of course, those we re&para;<br>jected as irrelevant in our discussion of whether there was&para;<br>any constitutional violation at all. And the Court of Ap&para;<br>peals’ reference to those cases here makes the same error&para;<br>of assuming that purpose is only disregarded when there&para;<br>is probable cause to suspect a violation of law.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals also found clearly established law&para;<br>lurking in the broad “history and purposes of the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment.” 580 F. 3d, at 971. We have repeatedly told&para;<br>courts—and the Ninth Circuit in particular, see Brosseau&para;<br>v. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194, 198–199 (2004) (per curiam)—&para;<br>not to define clearly established law at a high level of&para;<br>generality. See also, e.g., Wilson, supra, at 615; Anderson,&para;<br>supra, at 639–640; cf. Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 236&para;<br>(1990). The general proposition, for example, that an&para;<br>unreasonable search or seizure violates the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment is of little help in determining whether the&para;<br>violative nature of particular conduct is clearly estab&para;<br>lished. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 201–202 (2001);&para;<br>Wilson, supra, at 615.&para;<br>The same is true of the Court of Appeals’ broad histori&para;<br>cal assertions. The Fourth Amendment was a response to&para;<br>the English Crown’s use of general warrants, which often&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U.

See Stanford v. Texas, 379 U. S.&para;<br>476, 481–485 (1965). According to the Court of Appeals,&para;<br>Ashcroft should have seen that a pretextual warrant&para;<br>similarly “gut[s] the substantive protections of the Fourth&para;<br>Amendmen[t]” and allows the State “to arrest upon the&para;<br>executive’s mere suspicion.” 580 F. 3d, at 972.&para;<br>Ashcroft must be forgiven for missing the parallel,&para;<br>which escapes us as well. The principal evil of the general&para;<br>warrant was addressed by the Fourth Amendment’s par&para;<br>ticularity requirement, Stanford, supra, at 485, which&para;<br>Ashcroft’s alleged policy made no effort to evade. The&para;<br>warrant authorizing al-Kidd’s arrest named al-Kidd and&para;<br>only al-Kidd. It might be argued, perhaps, that when, in&para;<br>response to the English abuses, the Fourth Amendment&para;<br>said that warrants could only issue “on probable cause” it&para;<br>meant only probable cause to suspect a violation of law,&para;<br>and not probable cause to believe that the individual&para;<br>named in the warrant was a material witness. But that&para;<br>would make all arrests pursuant to material-witness&para;<br>warrants unconstitutional, whether pretextual or not—&para;<br>and that is not the position taken by al-Kidd in this case.&para;<br>While featuring a District Court’s footnoted dictum, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals made no mention of this Court’s affirma&para;<br>tion in Edmond of the “predominan[t]” rule that reason&para;<br>ableness is an objective inquiry, 531 U. S., at 47. Nor did it&para;<br>mention Whren’s and Knights’ statements that subjective&para;<br>intent mattered in a very limited subset of our Fourth&para;<br>Amendment cases; or Terry’s objective evaluation of inves&para;<br>tigatory searches premised on reasonable suspicion rather&para;<br>than probable cause; or Bond’s objective evaluation of a&para;<br>suspicionless investigatory search. The Court of Appeals&para;<br>seems to have cherry-picked the aspects of our opinions&para;<br>that gave colorable support to the proposition that the un&para;<br>constitutionality of the action here was clearly established.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Qualified immunity gives government officials breathing&para;<br>room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about&para;<br>open legal questions. When properly applied, it protects&para;<br>“all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly&para;<br>violate the law.” Malley, 475 U. S., at 341. Ashcroft de&para;<br>serves neither label, not least because eight Court of&para;<br>Appeals judges agreed with his judgment in a case of first&para;<br>impression. See Wilson, supra, at 618.

In holding that&para;<br>the Attorney General could be liable for damages based on&para;<br>an unprecedented constitutional rule, the Court of Appeals&para;<br>for the Ninth Circuit disregarded the purposes of the doc&para;<br>trine of qualified immunity. This concurring opinion makes&para;<br>two additional observations.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The Court’s holding is limited to the arguments pre&para;<br>sented by the parties and leaves unresolved whether the&para;<br>Government’s use of the Material Witness Statute in this&para;<br>case was lawful. See ante, at 8 (noting that al-Kidd “does&para;<br>not assert that his arrest would have been unconstitu&para;<br>tional absent the alleged pretextual use of the warrant”).&para;<br>Under the statute, a Magistrate Judge may issue a war&para;<br>rant to arrest someone as a material witness upon a show&para;<br>ing by affidavit that “the testimony of a person is material&para;<br>in a criminal proceeding” and “that it may become imprac&para;<br>ticable to secure the presence of the person by subpoena.”&para;<br>18 U. S. C. §3144. The scope of the statute’s lawful&para;<br>authorization is uncertain. For example, a law-abiding&para;<br>citizen might observe a crime during the days or weeks&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>before a scheduled flight abroad. It is unclear whether&para;<br>those facts alone might allow police to obtain a material&para;<br>witness warrant on the ground that it “may become im&para;<br>practicable” to secure the person’s presence by subpoena.&para;<br>Ibid. The question becomes more difficult if one further&para;<br>assumes the traveler would be willing to testify if asked;&para;<br>and more difficult still if one supposes that authorities&para;<br>delay obtaining or executing the warrant until the traveler&para;<br>has arrived at the airport. These possibilities resemble&para;<br>the facts in this case. See ante, at 2.&para;<br>In considering these issues, it is important to bear in&para;<br>mind that the Material Witness Statute might not provide&para;<br>for the issuance of warrants within the meaning of the&para;<br>Fourth Amendment’s Warrant Clause. The typical arrest&para;<br>warrant is based on probable cause that the arrestee has&para;<br>committed a crime; but that is not the standard for the&para;<br>issuance of warrants under the Material Witness Statute.&para;<br>See ante, at 11 (reserving the possibility that probable&para;<br>cause for purposes of the Fourth Amendment’s Warrant&para;<br>Clause means “only probable cause to suspect a violation&para;<br>of law”). If material witness warrants do not qualify as&para;<br>“Warrants” under the Fourth Amendment, then material&para;<br>witness arrests might still be governed by the Fourth&para;<br>Amendment’s separate reasonableness requirement for&para;<br>seizures of the person. See United States v. Watson, 423&para;<br>U. S. 411 (1976). Given the difficulty of these issues, the&para;<br>Court is correct to address only the legal theory put before&para;<br>it, without further exploring when material witness ar&para;<br>rests might be consistent with statutory and constitutional&para;<br>requirements.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The fact that the Attorney General holds a high office in&para;<br>the Government must inform what law is clearly estab&para;<br>lished for the purposes of this case. Mitchell v. Forsyth,&para;<br>472 U. S. 511, 525 (1985). Some federal officers perform&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>their functions in a single jurisdiction, say within the con&para;<br>fines of one State or one federal judicial district. They&para;<br>“reasonably can anticipate when their conduct may give&para;<br>rise to liability for damages” and so are expected to adjust&para;<br>their behavior in accordance with local precedent. Davis&para;<br>v. Scherer, 468 U. S. 183, 195 (1984); see also Anderson v.&para;<br>Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 639–640 (1987). In contrast the&para;<br>Attorney General occupies a national office and so sets&para;<br>policies implemented in many jurisdictions throughout the&para;<br>country. The official with responsibilities in many juris&para;<br>dictions may face ambiguous and sometimes inconsistent&para;<br>sources of decisional law. While it may be clear that one&para;<br>Court of Appeals has approved a certain course of conduct,&para;<br>other Courts of Appeals may have disapproved it, or at&para;<br>least reserved the issue.&para;<br>When faced with inconsistent legal rules in different&para;<br>jurisdictions, national officeholders should be given some&para;<br>deference for qualified immunity purposes, at least if they&para;<br>implement policies consistent with the governing law of&para;<br>the jurisdiction where the action is taken. As we have&para;<br>explained, qualified immunity is lost when plaintiffs point&para;<br>either to “cases of controlling authority in their jurisdic&para;<br>tion at the time of the incident” or to “a consensus of cases&para;<br>of persuasive authority such that a reasonable officer&para;<br>could not have believed that his actions were lawful.”&para;<br>Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 617 (1999); see also ante,&para;<br>at 9–10. These standards ensure the officer has “fair and&para;<br>clear warning” of what the Constitution requires. United&para;<br>States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 271 (1997).&para;<br>A national officeholder intent on retaining qualified&para;<br>immunity need not abide by the most stringent standard&para;<br>adopted anywhere in the United States. And the national&para;<br>officeholder need not guess at when a relatively small set&para;<br>of appellate precedents have established a binding legal&para;<br>rule.

AL-KIDD&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., concurring&para;<br>&para;<br>appellate courts, those officers would be deterred from full&para;<br>use of their legal authority. The consequences of that&para;<br>deterrence must counsel caution by the Judicial Branch,&para;<br>particularly in the area of national security. See Ashcroft&para;<br>v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21). Fur&para;<br>thermore, too expansive a view of “clearly established law”&para;<br>would risk giving local judicial determinations the effect of&para;<br>rules with de facto national significance, contrary to the&para;<br>normal process of ordered appellate review.&para;<br>The proceedings in this case illustrate these concerns.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit appears to&para;<br>have reasoned that a Federal District Court sitting in New&para;<br>York had authority to establish a legal rule binding on&para;<br>the Attorney General and, therefore, on federal law&para;<br>enforcement operations conducted nationwide. See 580&para;<br>F. 3d 949, 972–973 (2009). Indeed, this case involves a&para;<br>material witness warrant issued in Boise, Idaho, and an&para;<br>arrest near Washington, D. C. Of course, district court&para;<br>decisions are not precedential to this extent. Ante, at 9–&para;<br>10. But nationwide security operations should not have to&para;<br>grind to a halt even when an appellate court finds those&para;<br>operations unconstitutional.

In addition,&para;<br>the affidavit misrepresented that al-Kidd was about to&para;<br>take a one-way flight to Saudi Arabia, with a first-class&para;<br>ticket costing approximately $5,000; in fact, al-Kidd had a&para;<br>round-trip, coach-class ticket that cost $1,700.2 Given&para;<br>these omissions and misrepresentations, there is strong&para;<br>cause to question the Court’s opening assumption—a valid&para;<br>material-witness warrant—and equally strong reason to&para;<br>conclude that a merits determination was neither neces&para;<br>sary nor proper.3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Judicial officers asked to issue material witness warrants must&para;<br>determine whether the affidavit supporting the application shows that&para;<br>“the testimony of a person is material in a criminal proceeding” and&para;<br>that “it may become impracticable to secure the presence of the person&para;<br>by subpoena.” 18 U.

I&para;<br>cannot join the majority’s opinion, however, because it&para;<br>unnecessarily “resolve[s] [a] difficult and novel questio[n]&para;<br>of constitutional . . . interpretation that will ‘have no effect&para;<br>on the outcome of the case.’ ” Ante, at 3 (quoting Pearson&para;<br>v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 237 (2009)).&para;<br>Whether the Fourth Amendment permits the pretextual&para;<br>use of a material witness warrant for preventive detention&para;<br>of an individual whom the Government has no intention&para;<br>of using at trial is, in my view, a closer question than&para;<br>the majority’s opinion suggests. Although the majority&para;<br>is correct that a government official’s subjective intent is&para;<br>generally “irrelevant in determining whether that officer’s&para;<br>actions violate the Fourth Amendment,” Bond v. United&para;<br>States, 529 U. S. 334, 338, n. 2 (2000), none of our prior&para;<br>cases recognizing that principle involved prolonged deten­&para;<br>tion of an individual without probable cause to believe he&para;<br>had committed any criminal offense. We have never&para;<br>considered whether an official’s subjective intent matters&para;<br>for purposes of the Fourth Amendment in that novel con­&para;<br>text, and we need not and should not resolve that question&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ASHCROFT v. AL-KIDD&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>in this case. All Members of the Court agree that, what­&para;<br>ever the merits of the underlying Fourth Amendment&para;<br>question, Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law.&para;<br>The majority’s constitutional ruling is a narrow one pre­&para;<br>mised on the existence of a “valid material-witness war­&para;<br>ran[t],” ante, at 1—a premise that, at the very least, is&para;<br>questionable in light of the allegations set forth in alKidd’s complaint. Based on those allegations, it is not at&para;<br>all clear that it would have been “impracticable to secure&para;<br>[al-Kidd’s] presence . . . by subpoena” or that his testimony&para;<br>could not “adequately be secured by deposition.” 18&para;<br>U. S. C. §3144; see First Amended Complaint in No. 05–&para;<br>093–EJL, ¶55, App. 26 (“Mr. al-Kidd would have complied&para;<br>with a subpoena had he been issued one or agreed to a&para;<br>deposition”). Nor is it clear that the affidavit supporting&para;<br>the warrant was sufficient; its failure to disclose that the&para;<br>Government had no intention of using al-Kidd as a wit­&para;<br>ness at trial may very well have rendered the affidavit&para;<br>deliberately false and misleading. Cf. Franks v. Delaware,&para;<br>438 U. S. 154, 155–156 (1978). The majority assumes&para;<br>away these factual difficulties, but in my view, they point&para;<br>to the artificiality of the way the Fourth Amendment&para;<br>question has been presented to this Court and provide&para;<br>further reason to avoid rendering an unnecessary holding&para;<br>on the constitutional question.&para;<br>I also join Part I of JUSTICE KENNEDY’s concurring&para;<br>opinion. As that opinion makes clear, this case does not&para;<br>present an occasion to address the proper scope of the&para;<br>material witness statute or its constitutionality as applied&para;<br>in this case. Indeed, nothing in the majority’s opinion&para;<br>today should be read as placing this Court’s imprimatur&para;<br>on the actions taken by the Government against al-Kidd.&para;<br>Ante, at 1 (KENNEDY, J., concurring) (“The Court’s holding&para;<br>is limited to the arguments presented by the parties and&para;<br>leaves unresolved whether the Government’s use of the&para;<br>Material Witness Statute in this case was lawful”).&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
