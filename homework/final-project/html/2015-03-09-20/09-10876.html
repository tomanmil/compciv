NEW MEXICO&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW MEXICO&para;<br>No. 09–10876.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 2, 2011—Decided June 23, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>The Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause gives the accused “[i]n&para;<br>all criminal prosecutions, . . . the right . . . to be confronted with the&para;<br>witnesses against him.” In Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 59,&para;<br>this Court held that the Clause permits admission of “[t]estimonial&para;<br>statements of witnesses absent from trial . . . only where the decla&para;<br>rant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior&para;<br>opportunity to cross-examine.” Later, in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachu&para;<br>setts, 557 U. S. ___, the Court declined to create a “forensic evidence”&para;<br>exception to Crawford, holding that a forensic laboratory report, cre&para;<br>ated specifically to serve as evidence in a criminal proceeding, ranked&para;<br>as “testimonial” for Confrontation Clause purposes. Absent stipula&para;<br>tion, the Court ruled, the prosecution may not introduce such a re&para;<br>port without offering a live witness competent to testify to the truth&para;<br>of the report’s statements. 557 U. S., at ___.&para;<br>Petitioner Bullcoming’s jury trial on charges of driving while in&para;<br>toxicated (DWI) occurred after Crawford, but before Melendez-Diaz.&para;<br>Principal evidence against him was a forensic laboratory report certi&para;<br>fying that his blood-alcohol concentration was well above the thresh&para;<br>old for aggravated DWI. Bullcoming’s blood sample had been tested&para;<br>at the New Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory Divi&para;<br>sion (SLD), by a forensic analyst named Caylor, who completed,&para;<br>signed, and certified the report. However, the prosecution neither&para;<br>called Caylor to testify nor asserted he was unavailable; the record&para;<br>showed only that Caylor was placed on unpaid leave for an undis&para;<br>closed reason. In lieu of Caylor, the State called another analyst,&para;<br>Razatos, to validate the report. Razatos was familiar with the testing&para;<br>device used to analyze Bullcoming’s blood and with the laboratory’s&para;<br>testing procedures, but had neither participated in nor observed the&para;<br>test on Bullcoming’s blood sample. Bullcoming’s counsel objected, as&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>serting that introduction of Caylor’s report without his testimony&para;<br>would violate the Confrontation Clause, but the trial court overruled&para;<br>the objection, admitted the SLD report as a business record, and&para;<br>permitted Razatos to testify. Bullcoming was convicted, and, while&para;<br>his appeal was pending before the New Mexico Supreme Court, this&para;<br>Court decided Melendez-Diaz. The state high court acknowledged&para;<br>that the SLD report qualified as testimonial evidence under&para;<br>Melendez-Diaz, but held that the report’s admission did not violate&para;<br>the Confrontation Clause because: (1) certifying analyst Caylor was a&para;<br>mere scrivener who simply transcribed machine-generated test re&para;<br>sults, and (2) SLD analyst Razatos, although he did not participate in&para;<br>testing Bullcoming’s blood, qualified as an expert witness with re&para;<br>spect to the testing machine and SLD procedures. The court affirmed&para;<br>Bullcoming’s conviction.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.&para;<br>147 N. M. 487, 226 P. 3d 1, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court with respect&para;<br>to all but Part IV and footnote 6. The Confrontation Clause, the opin&para;<br>ion concludes, does not permit the prosecution to introduce a forensic&para;<br>laboratory report containing a testimonial certification, made in or&para;<br>der to prove a fact at a criminal trial, through the in-court testimony&para;<br>of an analyst who did not sign the certification or personally perform&para;<br>or observe the performance of the test reported in the certification.&para;<br>The accused’s right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the&para;<br>certification, unless that analyst is unavailable at trial, and the ac&para;<br>cused had an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine that particular&para;<br>scientist. Pp. 8–16.&para;<br>(a) If an out-of-court statement is testimonial, it may not be intro&para;<br>duced against the accused at trial unless the witness who made the&para;<br>statement is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity&para;<br>to confront that witness. Pp. 8–14.&para;<br>(i) Caylor’s certification reported more than a machine-generated&para;<br>number: It represented that he received Bullcoming’s blood sample&para;<br>intact with the seal unbroken; that he checked to make sure that the&para;<br>forensic report number and the sample number corresponded; that he&para;<br>performed a particular test on Bullcoming’s sample, adhering to a&para;<br>precise protocol; and that he left the report’s remarks section blank,&para;<br>indicating that no circumstance or condition affected the sample’s in&para;<br>tegrity or the analysis’ validity. These representations, relating to&para;<br>past events and human actions not revealed in raw, machine&para;<br>produced data, are meet for cross-examination. The potential ramifi&para;<br>cations of the state court’s reasoning, therefore, raise red flags. Most&para;<br>witnesses testify to their observations of factual conditions or events.&para;<br>Where, for example, a police officer’s report recorded an objective fact&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>such as the read-out of a radar gun, the state court’s reasoning would&para;<br>permit another officer to introduce the information, so long as he or&para;<br>she was equipped to testify about the technology the observing officer&para;<br>deployed and the police department’s standard operating procedures.&para;<br>As, e.g., Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 826, makes plain, how&para;<br>ever, such testimony would violate the Confrontation Clause. The&para;<br>comparative reliability of an analyst’s testimonial report does not&para;<br>dispense with the Clause. Crawford, 541 U. S., at 62. The analysts&para;<br>who write reports introduced as evidence must be made available for&para;<br>confrontation even if they have “the scientific acumen of Mme. Curie&para;<br>and the veracity of Mother Teresa.” Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___,&para;<br>n. 6. Pp. 10–11.&para;<br>(ii) Nor was Razatos an adequate substitute witness simply be&para;<br>cause he qualified as an expert with respect to the testing machine&para;<br>and the SLD’s laboratory procedures. Surrogate testimony of the&para;<br>kind Razatos was equipped to give could not convey what Caylor&para;<br>knew or observed about the events he certified, nor expose any lapses&para;<br>or lies on Caylor’s part. Significantly, Razatos did not know why&para;<br>Caylor had been placed on unpaid leave. With Caylor on the stand,&para;<br>Bullcoming’s counsel could have asked Caylor questions designed to&para;<br>reveal whether Caylor’s incompetence, evasiveness, or dishonesty ac&para;<br>counted for his removal from work. And the State did not assert that&para;<br>Razatos had any independent opinion concerning Bullcoming’s blood&para;<br>alcohol content. More fundamentally, the Confrontation Clause does&para;<br>not tolerate dispensing with confrontation simply because the court&para;<br>believes that questioning one witness about another’s testimonial&para;<br>statements provides a fair enough opportunity for cross-examination.&para;<br>Although the purpose of Sixth Amendment rights is to ensure a fair&para;<br>trial, it does not follow that such rights can be disregarded because,&para;<br>on the whole, the trial is fair. United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548&para;<br>U. S. 140, 145. If a “particular guarantee” is violated, no substitute&para;<br>procedure can cure the violation. Id., at 146. Pp. 11–14.&para;<br>(b) Melendez-Diaz precluded the State’s argument that introduc&para;<br>tion of the SLD report did not implicate the Confrontation Clause be&para;<br>cause the report is nontestimonial. Like the certificates in MelendezDiaz, the SLD report is undoubtedly an “affirmation made for the&para;<br>purpose of establishing or proving some fact” in a criminal proceed&para;<br>ing. 557 U. S., at ___. Created solely for an “evidentiary purpose,”&para;<br>id., at ___, the report ranks as testimonial. In all material respects,&para;<br>the SLD report resembles the certificates in Melendez-Diaz. Here, as&para;<br>there, an officer provided seized evidence to a state laboratory re&para;<br>quired by law to assist in police investigations. Like the MelendezDiaz analysts, Caylor tested the evidence and prepared a certificate&para;<br>concerning the result of his analysis. And like the Melendez-Diaz&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>certificates, Caylor’s report here is “formalized” in a signed document,&para;<br>Davis, 547 U. S., at 837, n. 2. Also noteworthy, the SLD report form&para;<br>contains a legend referring to municipal and magistrate courts’ rules&para;<br>that provide for the admission of certified blood-alcohol analyses.&para;<br>Thus, although the SLD report was not notarized, the formalities at&para;<br>tending the report were more than adequate to qualify Caylor’s as&para;<br>sertions as testimonial.

NEW MEXICO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>laboratory’s testing procedures, but had neither partici­&para;<br>pated in nor observed the test on Bullcoming’s blood sam­&para;<br>ple. The New Mexico Supreme Court determined that,&para;<br>although the blood-alcohol analysis was “testimonial,” the&para;<br>Confrontation Clause did not require the certifying ana­&para;<br>lyst’s in-court testimony. Instead, New Mexico’s high&para;<br>court held, live testimony of another analyst satisfied the&para;<br>constitutional requirements.&para;<br>The question presented is whether the Confrontation&para;<br>Clause permits the prosecution to introduce a forensic&para;<br>laboratory report containing a testimonial certification—&para;<br>made for the purpose of proving a particular fact—through&para;<br>the in-court testimony of a scientist who did not sign the&para;<br>certification or perform or observe the test reported in the&para;<br>certification.

The&para;<br>accused’s right is to be confronted with the analyst who&para;<br>made the certification, unless that analyst is unavailable&para;<br>at trial, and the accused had an opportunity, pretrial, to&para;<br>cross-examine that particular scientist.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>In August 2005, a vehicle driven by petitioner Donald&para;<br>Bullcoming rear-ended a pick-up truck at an intersection&para;<br>in Farmington, New Mexico. When the truckdriver exited&para;<br>his vehicle and approached Bullcoming to exchange insur­&para;<br>ance information, he noticed that Bullcoming’s eyes were&para;<br>bloodshot. Smelling alcohol on Bullcoming’s breath, the&para;<br>truckdriver told his wife to call the police. Bullcoming left&para;<br>the scene before the police arrived, but was soon appre­&para;<br>hended by an officer who observed his performance of field&para;<br>sobriety tests. Upon failing the tests, Bullcoming was&para;<br>arrested for driving a vehicle while “under the influence of&para;<br>intoxicating liquor” (DWI), in violation of N. M. Stat. Ann.&para;<br>§66–8–102 (2004).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Because Bullcoming refused to take a breath test, the&para;<br>police obtained a warrant authorizing a blood-alcohol analy­&para;<br>sis. Pursuant to the warrant, a sample of Bullcoming’s&para;<br>blood was drawn at a local hospital. To determine Bull­&para;<br>coming’s blood-alcohol concentration (BAC), the police&para;<br>sent the sample to the New Mexico Department of Health,&para;<br>Scientific Laboratory Division (SLD). In a standard SLD&para;<br>form titled “Report of Blood Alcohol Analysis,” partici­&para;<br>pants in the testing were identified, and the forensic ana­&para;<br>lyst certified his finding. App. 62.&para;<br>SLD’s report contained in the top block “information . . .&para;<br>filled in by [the] arresting officer.” Ibid. (capitalization&para;<br>omitted). This information included the “reason [the]&para;<br>suspect [was] stopped” (the officer checked “Accident”),&para;<br>and the date (“8.14.05”) and time (“18:25 PM”) the blood&para;<br>sample was drawn. Ibid. (capitalization omitted). The&para;<br>arresting officer also affirmed that he had arrested Bull­&para;<br>coming and witnessed the blood draw. Ibid. The next two&para;<br>blocks contained certifications by the nurse who drew&para;<br>Bullcoming’s blood and the SLD intake employee who&para;<br>received the blood sample sent to the laboratory. Ibid.&para;<br>Following these segments, the report presented the&para;<br>“certificate of analyst,” ibid. (capitalization omitted), com­&para;<br>pleted and signed by Curtis Caylor, the SLD forensic&para;<br>analyst assigned to test Bullcoming’s blood sample. Id., at&para;<br>62, 64–65. Caylor recorded that the BAC in Bullcoming’s&para;<br>sample was 0.21 grams per hundred milliliters, an inordi­&para;<br>nately high level. Id., at 62. Caylor also affirmed that&para;<br>“[t]he seal of th[e] sample was received intact and broken&para;<br>in the laboratory,” that “the statements in [the analyst’s&para;<br>block of the report] are correct,” and that he had “followed&para;<br>the procedures set out on the reverse of th[e] report.” Ibid.&para;<br>Those “procedures” instructed analysts, inter alia, to “re­&para;<br>tai[n] the sample container and the raw data from the&para;<br>analysis,” and to “not[e] any circumstance or condition&para;<br>which might affect the integrity of the sample or otherwise&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>affect the validity of the analysis.” Id., at 65. Finally, in a&para;<br>block headed “certificate of reviewer,” the SLD examiner&para;<br>who reviewed Caylor’s analysis certified that Caylor was&para;<br>qualified to conduct the BAC test, and that the “estab­&para;<br>lished procedure” for handling and analyzing Bullcoming’s&para;<br>sample “ha[d] been followed.” Id., at 62 (capitalization&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>SLD analysts use gas chromatograph machines to de­&para;<br>termine BAC levels. Operation of the machines requires&para;<br>specialized knowledge and training. Several steps are&para;<br>involved in the gas chromatograph process, and human&para;<br>error can occur at each step.1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Gas&para;<br>&para;<br>chromatography is a widely used scientific method of quan­&para;<br>titatively analyzing the constituents of a mixture. See generally H.&para;<br>McNair &amp; J. Miller, Basic Gas Chromatography (2d ed. 2009) (hereinaf­&para;<br>ter McNair). Under SLD’s standard testing protocol, the analyst ex­&para;<br>tracts two blood samples and inserts them into vials containing an&para;<br>“internal standard”—a chemical additive. App. 53. See McNair 141–&para;<br>142. The analyst then “cap[s] the [two] sample[s],” “crimp[s] them with&para;<br>an aluminum top,” and places the vials into the gas chromatograph&para;<br>machine. App. 53–54. Within a few hours, this device produces a&para;<br>printed graph—a chromatogram—along with calculations representing&para;<br>a software-generated interpretation of the data. See Brief for State of&para;<br>New Mexico Dept. of Health, SLD as Amicus Curiae 16–17.&para;<br>Although the State presented testimony that obtaining an accurate&para;<br>BAC measurement merely entails “look[ing] at the [gas chromatograph]&para;<br>machine and record[ing] the results,” App. 54, authoritative sources re­&para;<br>veal that the matter is not so simple or certain. “In order to perform&para;<br>quantitative analyses satisfactorily and . . . support the results under&para;<br>rigorous examination in court, the analyst must be aware of, and&para;<br>adhere to, good analytical practices and understand what is being done&para;<br>and why.” Stafford, Chromatography, in Principles of Forensic Toxicol­&para;<br>ogy 92, 114 (B.

The State, how­&para;<br>ever, proposed to introduce Caylor’s finding as a “business&para;<br>——————&para;<br>valid.

Like the affidavits in Melendez-Diaz, the court&para;<br>observed, the report was “functionally identical to live, in­&para;<br>court testimony, doing precisely what a witness does on&para;<br>direct examination.” 226 P. 3d, at 8 (quoting MelendezDiaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4)).4 Nevertheless, for&para;<br>two reasons, the court held that admission of the report&para;<br>did not violate the Confrontation Clause.&para;<br>First, the court said certifying analyst Caylor “was a&para;<br>mere scrivener,” who “simply transcribed the results gen­&para;<br>erated by the gas chromatograph machine.” 226 P. 3d,&para;<br>at 8–9. Second, SLD analyst Razatos, although he did not&para;<br>participate in testing Bullcoming’s blood, “qualified as&para;<br>an expert witness with respect to the gas chromatograph&para;<br>machine.” Id., at 9. “Razatos provided live, in-court tes­&para;<br>timony,” the court stated, “and, thus, was available for&para;<br>cross-examination regarding the operation of the . . . ma­&para;<br>chine, the results of [Bullcoming’s] BAC test, and the&para;<br>SLD’s established laboratory procedures.” Ibid. Razatos’&para;<br>testimony was crucial, the court explained, because Bull­&para;<br>coming could not cross-examine the machine or the writ­&para;<br>ten report. Id., at 10. But “[Bullcoming’s] right of con­&para;<br>frontation was preserved,” the court concluded, because&para;<br>Razatos was a qualified analyst, able to serve as a surro­&para;<br>gate for Caylor.

NEW MEXICO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>a forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certi­&para;<br>fication, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal trial,&para;<br>through the in-court testimony of an analyst who did not&para;<br>sign the certification or personally perform or observe the&para;<br>performance of the test reported in the certification. 561&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2010). Our answer is in line with controlling&para;<br>precedent: As a rule, if an out-of-court statement is testi­&para;<br>monial in nature, it may not be introduced against the&para;<br>accused at trial unless the witness who made the state­&para;<br>ment is unavailable and the accused has had a prior op­&para;<br>portunity to confront that witness. Because the New&para;<br>Mexico Supreme Court permitted the testimonial state­&para;<br>ment of one witness, i.e., Caylor, to enter into evidence&para;<br>through the in-court testimony of a second person, i.e.,&para;<br>Razatos, we reverse that court’s judgment.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause confers&para;<br>upon the accused “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, . . . the&para;<br>right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him.”&para;<br>In a pathmarking 2004 decision, Crawford v. Washington,&para;<br>we overruled Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), which&para;<br>had interpreted the Confrontation Clause to allow admis­&para;<br>sion of absent witnesses’ testimonial statements based on&para;<br>a judicial determination of reliability. See Roberts, 448&para;<br>U. S., at 66. Rejecting Roberts’ “amorphous notions of ‘re­&para;<br>liability,’ ” Crawford, 541 U. S., at 61, Crawford held&para;<br>that fidelity to the Confrontation Clause permitted admis­&para;<br>sion of “[t]estimonial statements of witnesses absent from&para;<br>trial . . . only where the declarant is unavailable, and only&para;<br>where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross­&para;<br>examine,” id., at 59. See Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7) (“[F]or testimonial evidence&para;<br>to be admissible, the Sixth Amendment ‘demands what&para;<br>the common law required: unavailability [of the witness]&para;<br>and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.’ ” (quoting&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

Melendez-Diaz, relying on&para;<br>Crawford’s rationale, refused to create a “forensic evi­&para;<br>dence” exception to this rule. 557 U. S., at ___–___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 11–15).5 An analyst’s certification prepared in&para;<br>connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution,&para;<br>the Court held, is “testimonial,” and therefore within the&para;<br>compass of the Confrontation Clause. Id., at ___–___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 15–18).6&para;<br>The State in the instant case never asserted that the&para;<br>analyst who signed the certification, Curtis Caylor, was&para;<br>unavailable. The record showed only that Caylor was&para;<br>placed on unpaid leave for an undisclosed reason. See&para;<br>supra, at 5. Nor did Bullcoming have an opportunity&para;<br>to cross-examine Caylor. Crawford and Melendez-Diaz,&para;<br>therefore, weigh heavily in Bullcoming’s favor. The New&para;<br>Mexico Supreme Court, however, although recognizing&para;<br>that the SLD report was testimonial for purposes of the&para;<br>Confrontation Clause, considered SLD analyst Razatos an&para;<br>adequate substitute for Caylor. We explain first why&para;<br>Razatos’ appearance did not meet the Confrontation&para;<br>Clause requirement. We next address the State’s argu­&para;<br>ment that the SLD report ranks as “nontestimonial,” and&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The dissent makes plain that its objection is less to the application&para;<br>of the Court’s decisions in Crawford and Melendez-Diaz to this case&para;<br>than to those pathmarking decisions themselves. See post, at 5 (criti­&para;<br>cizing the “Crawford line of cases” for rejecting “reliable evidence”);&para;<br>post, at 8–9, 11 (deploring “Crawford’s rejection of the [reliability­&para;<br>centered] regime of Ohio v. Roberts”).&para;<br>6 To rank as “testimonial,” a statement must have a “primary pur­&para;<br>pose” of “establish[ing] or prov[ing] past events potentially relevant to&para;<br>later criminal prosecution.” Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 822&para;<br>(2006). See also Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). Elaborating&para;<br>on the purpose for which a “testimonial report” is created, we observed&para;<br>in Melendez-Diaz that business and public records “are generally&para;<br>admissible absent confrontation . . . because—having been created for&para;<br>the administration of an entity’s affairs and not for the purpose of&para;<br>establishing or proving some fact at trial—they are not testimonial.”&para;<br>557 U.

Brief for Respondent 7 (capitalization&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>A&para;<br>The New Mexico Supreme Court held surrogate testi­&para;<br>mony adequate to satisfy the Confrontation Clause in&para;<br>this case because analyst Caylor “simply transcribed the&para;<br>resul[t] generated by the gas chromatograph machine,”&para;<br>presenting no interpretation and exercising no independ­&para;<br>ent judgment. 226 P. 3d, at 8. Bullcoming’s “true ‘ac­&para;<br>cuser,’ ” the court said, was the machine, while testing&para;<br>analyst Caylor’s role was that of “mere scrivener.” Id., at&para;<br>9. Caylor’s certification, however, reported more than a&para;<br>machine-generated number. See supra, at 3–4.&para;<br>Caylor certified that he received Bullcoming’s blood&para;<br>sample intact with the seal unbroken, that he checked to&para;<br>make sure that the forensic report number and the sample&para;<br>number “correspond[ed],” and that he performed on Bull­&para;<br>coming’s sample a particular test, adhering to a precise&para;<br>protocol. App. 62–65. He further represented, by leaving&para;<br>the “[r]emarks” section of the report blank, that no “cir­&para;<br>cumstance or condition . . . affect[ed] the integrity of the&para;<br>sample or . . . the validity of the analysis.” Id., at 62, 65.&para;<br>These representations, relating to past events and human&para;<br>actions not revealed in raw, machine-produced data, are&para;<br>meet for cross-examination.&para;<br>The potential ramifications of the New Mexico Supreme&para;<br>Court’s reasoning, furthermore, raise red flags. Most wit­&para;<br>nesses, after all, testify to their observations of factual&para;<br>conditions or events, e.g., “the light was green,” “the hour&para;<br>was noon.” Such witnesses may record, on the spot, what&para;<br>they observed. Suppose a police report recorded an objec­&para;<br>tive fact—Bullcoming’s counsel posited the address above&para;<br>the front door of a house or the read-out of a radar gun.&para;<br>See Brief for Petitioner 35.

As our precedent makes plain, the answer is&para;<br>emphatically “No.” See Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S.&para;<br>813, 826 (2006) (Confrontation Clause may not be “evaded&para;<br>by having a note-taking police[ officer] recite the . . . tes­&para;<br>timony of the declarant” (emphasis deleted)); MelendezDiaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (KENNEDY, J., dis­&para;<br>senting) (“The Court made clear in Davis that it will not&para;<br>permit the testimonial statement of one witness to enter&para;<br>into evidence through the in-court testimony of a second.”).&para;<br>The New Mexico Supreme Court stated that the number&para;<br>registered by the gas chromatograph machine called for&para;<br>no interpretation or exercise of independent judgment on&para;<br>Caylor’s part. 226 P. 3d, at 8–9. We have already ex­&para;<br>plained that Caylor certified to more than a machine­&para;<br>generated number. See supra, at 3–4. In any event, the&para;<br>comparative reliability of an analyst’s testimonial report&para;<br>drawn from machine-produced data does not overcome the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment bar. This Court settled in Crawford&para;<br>that the “obviou[s] reliab[ility]” of a testimonial statement&para;<br>does not dispense with the Confrontation Clause. 541&para;<br>U.

Accordingly, the analysts who&para;<br>write reports that the prosecution introduces must be&para;<br>made available for confrontation even if they possess “the&para;<br>scientific acumen of Mme.

NEW MEXICO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>depended on “live, in-court testimony [by] a qualified ana­&para;<br>lyst,” 226 P. 3d, at 10, the New Mexico Supreme Court&para;<br>believed that Razatos could substitute for Caylor because&para;<br>Razatos “qualified as an expert witness with respect to the&para;<br>gas chromatograph machine and the SLD’s labora­&para;<br>tory procedures,” id., at 9. But surrogate testimony of the&para;<br>kind Razatos was equipped to give could not convey what&para;<br>Caylor knew or observed about the events his certification&para;<br>concerned, i.e., the particular test and testing process he&para;<br>employed.7 Nor could such surrogate testimony expose&para;<br>any lapses or lies on the certifying analyst’s part.8 Signifi­&para;<br>cant here, Razatos had no knowledge of the reason why&para;<br>Caylor had been placed on unpaid leave. With Caylor on&para;<br>the stand, Bullcoming’s counsel could have asked ques­&para;<br>tions designed to reveal whether incompetence, evasive­&para;<br>ness, or dishonesty accounted for Caylor’s removal from&para;<br>his work station. Notable in this regard, the State never&para;<br>asserted that Caylor was “unavailable”; the prosecution&para;<br>conveyed only that Caylor was on uncompensated leave.&para;<br>Nor did the State assert that Razatos had any “independ­&para;<br>ent opinion” concerning Bullcoming’s BAC. See Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 58, n. 15. In this light, Caylor’s live testimony&para;<br>could hardly be typed “a hollow formality,” post, at 4.&para;<br>More fundamentally, as this Court stressed in Craw&para;<br>ford, “[t]he text of the Sixth Amendment does not sug­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 We do not question that analyst Caylor, in common with other ana­&para;<br>lysts employed by SLD, likely would not recall a particular test, given&para;<br>the number of tests each analyst conducts and the standard procedure&para;<br>followed in testing. Even so, Caylor’s testimony under oath would have&para;<br>enabled Bullcoming’s counsel to raise before a jury questions concern­&para;<br>ing Caylor’s proficiency, the care he took in performing his work, and&para;<br>his veracity. In particular, Bullcoming’s counsel likely would have&para;<br>inquired on cross-examination why Caylor had been placed on unpaid&para;<br>leave.&para;<br>8 At Bullcoming’s trial, Razatos acknowledged that “you don’t know&para;<br>unless you actually observe the analysis that someone else conducts,&para;<br>whether they followed th[e] protocol in every instance.” App. 59.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>gest any open-ended exceptions from the confrontation re­&para;<br>quirement to be developed by the courts.” 541 U. S., at 54.&para;<br>Nor is it “the role of courts to extrapolate from the words&para;<br>of the [Confrontation Clause] to the values behind it, and&para;<br>then to enforce its guarantees only to the extent they serve&para;<br>(in the courts’ views) those underlying values.” Giles v.&para;<br>California, 554 U. S. 353, 375 (2008). Accordingly, the&para;<br>Clause does not tolerate dispensing with confrontation&para;<br>simply because the court believes that questioning one&para;<br>witness about another’s testimonial statements provides a&para;<br>fair enough opportunity for cross-examination.&para;<br>A recent decision involving another Sixth Amendment&para;<br>right—the right to counsel—is instructive. In United&para;<br>States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140 (2006), the Gov­&para;<br>ernment argued that illegitimately denying a defendant&para;<br>his counsel of choice did not violate the Sixth Amendment where “substitute counsel’s performance” did not&para;<br>demonstrably prejudice the defendant. Id., at 144–145.&para;<br>This Court rejected the Government’s argument. “[T]rue&para;<br>enough,” the Court explained, “the purpose of the rights&para;<br>set forth in [the Sixth] Amendment is to ensure a fair&para;<br>trial; but it does not follow that the rights can be disre­&para;<br>garded so long as the trial is, on the whole, fair.” Id., at&para;<br>145. If a “particular guarantee” of the Sixth Amendment&para;<br>is violated, no substitute procedure can cure the violation,&para;<br>and “[n]o additional showing of prejudice is required to&para;<br>make the violation ‘complete.’ ” Id., at 146. If repre­&para;<br>sentation by substitute counsel does not satisfy the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment, neither does the opportunity to confront a&para;<br>substitute witness.&para;<br>In short, when the State elected to introduce Caylor’s&para;<br>certification, Caylor became a witness Bullcoming had the&para;<br>right to confront. Our precedent cannot sensibly be read&para;<br>any other way. See Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 6) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (Court’s holding means&para;<br>“the . . . analyst who must testify is the person who signed&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the certificate”).&para;<br>III&para;<br>We turn, finally, to the State’s contention that the SLD’s&para;<br>blood-alcohol analysis reports are nontestimonial in char­&para;<br>acter, therefore no Confrontation Clause question even&para;<br>arises in this case. Melendez-Diaz left no room for that&para;<br>argument, the New Mexico Supreme Court concluded,&para;<br>see 226 P. 3d, at 7–8; supra, at 7, a conclusion we find&para;<br>inescapable.&para;<br>In Melendez-Diaz, a state forensic laboratory, on police&para;<br>request, analyzed seized evidence (plastic bags) and re­&para;<br>ported the laboratory’s analysis to the police (the sub­&para;<br>stance found in the bags contained cocaine). 557 U. S., at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 2). The “certificates of analysis” prepared&para;<br>by the analysts who tested the evidence in Melendez-Diaz,&para;<br>this Court held, were “incontrovertibly . . . affirmation[s]&para;<br>made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact”&para;<br>in a criminal proceeding. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (inter­&para;<br>nal quotation marks omitted). The same purpose was&para;<br>served by the certificate in question here.&para;<br>The State maintains that the affirmations made by&para;<br>analyst Caylor were not “adversarial” or “inquisitorial,”&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 27–33; instead, they were simply&para;<br>observations of an “independent scientis[t]” made “accord­&para;<br>ing to a non-adversarial public duty,” id., at 32–33. That&para;<br>argument fares no better here than it did in MelendezDiaz. A document created solely for an “evidentiary pur­&para;<br>pose,” Melendez-Diaz clarified, made in aid of a police&para;<br>investigation, ranks as testimonial. 557 U. S., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 5) (forensic reports available for use at trial are&para;<br>“testimonial statements” and certifying analyst is a&para;<br>“ ‘witness’ for purposes of the Sixth Amendment”).&para;<br>Distinguishing Bullcoming’s case from Melendez-Diaz,&para;<br>where the analysts’ findings were contained in certificates&para;<br>“sworn to before a notary public,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 2),&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

As the New Mexico&para;<br>Supreme Court recognized, “ ‘the absence of [an] oath [i]s&para;<br>not dispositive’ in determining if a statement is testimo­&para;<br>nial.” 226 P. 3d, at 8 (quoting Crawford, 541 U. S., at 52).&para;<br>Indeed, in Crawford, this Court rejected as untenable any&para;<br>construction of the Confrontation Clause that would ren­&para;<br>der inadmissible only sworn ex parte affidavits, while&para;<br>leaving admission of formal, but unsworn statements&para;<br>“perfectly OK.” Id., at 52–53, n. 3. Reading the Clause in&para;<br>this “implausible” manner, ibid., the Court noted, would&para;<br>make the right to confrontation easily erasable. See&para;<br>Davis, 547 U. S., at 830–831, n. 5; id., at 838 (THOMAS, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).&para;<br>In all material respects, the laboratory report in this&para;<br>case resembles those in Melendez-Diaz. Here, as in&para;<br>Melendez-Diaz, a law-enforcement officer provided seized&para;<br>evidence to a state laboratory required by law to assist in&para;<br>police investigations, N. M. Stat. Ann. §29–3–4 (2004).&para;<br>Like the analysts in Melendez-Diaz, analyst Caylor tested&para;<br>the evidence and prepared a certificate concerning the&para;<br>result of his analysis. App. 62. Like the Melendez-Diaz&para;<br>certificates, Caylor’s certificate is “formalized” in a signed&para;<br>document, Davis, 547 U. S., at 837, n. 2 (opinion of&para;<br>THOMAS, J.), headed a “report,” App. 62. Noteworthy as&para;<br>well, the SLD report form contains a legend referring to&para;<br>municipal and magistrate courts’ rules that provide for the&para;<br>admission of certified blood-alcohol analyses.&para;<br>In sum, the formalities attending the “report of blood&para;<br>alcohol analysis” are more than adequate to qualify Cay­&para;<br>lor’s assertions as testimonial. The absence of notariza­&para;<br>tion does not remove his certification from Confrontation&para;<br>Clause governance.

The con­&para;<br>stitutional requirement, we reiterate, “may not [be] disre­&para;<br>gard[ed] . . . at our convenience,” id., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>19), and the predictions of dire consequences, we again&para;<br>observe, are dubious, see id., at ___ (slip op., at 19–20).&para;<br>New Mexico law, it bears emphasis, requires the lab­&para;<br>oratory to preserve samples, which can be retested by&para;<br>other analysts, see N. M. Admin.

Retesting “is almost&para;<br>always an option . . . in [DWI] cases,” Brief for Public&para;<br>Defender Service for District of Columbia et al. as Amici&para;<br>Curiae 25 (hereinafter PDS Brief), and the State had that&para;<br>option here: New Mexico could have avoided any Confron­&para;<br>tation Clause problem by asking Razatos to retest the&para;<br>sample, and then testify to the results of his retest rather&para;<br>than to the results of a test he did not conduct or observe.&para;<br>Notably, New Mexico advocates retesting as an effective&para;<br>means to preserve a defendant’s confrontation right “when&para;<br>the [out-of-court] statement is raw data or a mere tran­&para;<br>scription of raw data onto a public record.” Brief for Re­&para;<br>spondent 53–54.

Hence the&para;<br>obligation to propel retesting when the original analyst is&para;<br>unavailable is the State’s, not the defendant’s. See Taylor&para;<br>v. Illinois, 484 U.

Statutes governing these procedures&para;<br>typically “render . . . otherwise hearsay forensic reports&para;<br>admissible[,] while specifically preserving a defendant’s&para;<br>right to demand that the prosecution call the author/&para;<br>analyst of [the] report.” PDS Brief 9; see MelendezDiaz, 557 U.

Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 51 (2004), in turn&para;<br>quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the&para;<br>English Language (1828)).&para;<br>As we explained earlier this Term in Michigan v.

We concluded, therefore, that because the purpose of&para;<br>the certificates of analysis was use at trial, they were not&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Contrary to the dissent’s characterization, Bryant deemed reliabil­&para;<br>ity, as reflected in the hearsay rules, to be “relevant,” 562 U.

The hearsay rule’s recognition of the&para;<br>certificates’ evidentiary purpose thus confirmed our deci­&para;<br>sion that the certificates were testimonial under the pri­&para;<br>mary purpose analysis required by the Confrontation&para;<br>Clause. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (explaining that&para;<br>under Massachusetts law not just the purpose but the&para;<br>“sole purpose of the affidavits was to provide” evidence).&para;<br>Similarly, in this case, for the reasons the Court sets&para;<br>forth the BAC report and Caylor’s certification on it&para;<br>clearly have a “primary purpose of creating an out-of-court&para;<br>substitute for trial testimony.” Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 11). The Court also explains why the BAC&para;<br>report is not materially distinguishable from the certifi­&para;<br>cates we held testimonial in Melendez-Diaz. See 557 U. S.,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 2, 4–5). 2&para;<br>The formality inherent in the certification further sug­&para;<br>gests its evidentiary purpose. Although “[f]ormality is not&para;<br>the sole touchstone of our primary purpose inquiry,” a&para;<br>statement’s formality or informality can shed light on&para;<br>whether a particular statement has a primary purpose&para;<br>of use at trial. Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). 3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 This is not to say, however, that every person noted on the BAC&para;<br>report must testify. As we explained in Melendez-Diaz, it is not the&para;<br>case “that anyone whose testimony may be relevant in establishing the&para;<br>chain of custody, authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing&para;<br>device, must appear in person as part of the prosecution’s case . . . . It&para;<br>is up to the prosecution to decide what steps in the chain of custody are&para;<br>so crucial as to require evidence . . . .” 557 U. S., at ___, n. 1 (slip op.,&para;<br>at 5, n. 1).&para;<br>3 By looking to the formality of a statement, we do not “trea[t] the&para;<br>reliability of evidence as a reason to exclude it.” Post, at 5 (KENNEDY, J.,&para;<br>dissenting). Although in some instances formality could signal reliabil­&para;<br>ity, the dissent’s argument fails to appreciate that, under our Confron­&para;<br>tation Clause precedents, formality is primarily an indicator of testi­&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part&para;<br>&para;<br>I agree with the Court’s assessment that the certificate at&para;<br>issue here is a formal statement, despite the absence of&para;<br>notarization. Ante, at 14–15; Crawford, 541 U. S., at 52&para;<br>(“[T]he absence of [an] oath [is] not dispositive”). The&para;<br>formality derives from the fact that the analyst is asked to&para;<br>sign his name and “certify” to both the result and the&para;<br>statements on the form. A “certification” requires one&para;<br>“[t]o attest” that the accompanying statements are true.&para;<br>Black’s Law Dictionary 258 (9th ed. 2009) (definition of&para;<br>“certify”); see also id., at 147 (defining “attest” as “[t]o bear&para;<br>witness; testify,” or “[t]o affirm to be true or genuine; to&para;<br>authenticate by signing as a witness”).&para;<br>In sum, I am compelled to conclude that the report has a&para;<br>“primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for&para;<br>trial testimony,” Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11),&para;<br>which renders it testimonial.&para;<br>B&para;<br>After holding that the report was testimonial, the New&para;<br>Mexico Supreme Court nevertheless held that its admis­&para;<br>sion was permissible under the Confrontation Clause for&para;<br>two reasons: because Caylor was a “mere scrivener,” and&para;<br>because Razatos could be cross-examined on the workings&para;<br>of the gas chromatograph and laboratory procedures. 226&para;<br>P. 3d, at 8–10. The Court convincingly explains why those&para;<br>——————&para;<br>monial purpose. Formality is not the sole indicator of the testimonial&para;<br>nature of a statement because it is too easily evaded. See Davis v.&para;<br>Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 838 (2006) (THOMAS, J., concurring in&para;<br>judgment in part and dissenting in part). Nonetheless formality has&para;<br>long been a hallmark of testimonial statements because formality&para;<br>suggests that the statement is intended for use at trial. As we ex­&para;<br>plained in Bryant, informality, on the other hand, “does not necessarily&para;<br>indicate . . . lack of testimonial intent.” 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>19). The dissent itself recognizes the relevance of formality to the&para;<br>testimonial inquiry when it notes the formality of the problematic&para;<br>unconfronted statements in Sir Walter Raleigh’s trial.

Therefore, the&para;<br>New Mexico court contravened our precedents in holding&para;<br>that the report was admissible via Razatos’ testimony.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Although this case is materially indistinguishable from&para;<br>the facts we considered in Melendez-Diaz, I highlight&para;<br>some of the factual circumstances that this case does not&para;<br>present.&para;<br>First, this is not a case in which the State suggested an&para;<br>alternate purpose, much less an alternate primary pur­&para;<br>pose, for the BAC report. For example, the State has not&para;<br>claimed that the report was necessary to provide Bullcom­&para;<br>ing with medical treatment. See Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ ,&para;<br>n. 9 (slip op., at 15, n. 9) (listing “Statements for Purposes&para;<br>of Medical Diagnosis or Treatment” under Federal Rule of&para;<br>Evidence 803(4) as an example of statements that are&para;<br>“by their nature, made for a purpose other than use in a&para;<br>prosecution”); Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___, n. 2 (slip&para;<br>op., at 6, n. 2) (“[M]edical reports created for treatment&para;<br>purposes . . . would not be testimonial under our decision&para;<br>today”); Giles v. California, 554 U. S. 353, 376 (2008)&para;<br>(“[S]tatements to physicians in the course of receiving&para;<br>treatment would be excluded, if at all, only by hearsay&para;<br>rules”).&para;<br>Second, this is not a case in which the person testifying&para;<br>is a supervisor, reviewer, or someone else with a personal,&para;<br>albeit limited, connection to the scientific test at issue.&para;<br>Razatos conceded on cross-examination that he played no&para;<br>role in producing the BAC report and did not observe any&para;<br>portion of Curtis Caylor’s conduct of the testing. App. 58.&para;<br>The court below also recognized Razatos’ total lack of&para;<br>connection to the test at issue. 226 P. 3d, at 6. It would&para;<br>be a different case if, for example, a supervisor who ob­&para;<br>served an analyst conducting a test testified about the&para;<br>results or a report about such results. We need not ad­&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part&para;<br>&para;<br>dress what degree of involvement is sufficient because&para;<br>here Razatos had no involvement whatsoever in the rele­&para;<br>vant test and report.&para;<br>Third, this is not a case in which an expert witness was&para;<br>asked for his independent opinion about underlying testi­&para;<br>monial reports that were not themselves admitted into&para;<br>evidence. See Fed. Rule Evid. 703 (explaining that facts or&para;<br>data of a type upon which experts in the field would rea­&para;<br>sonably rely in forming an opinion need not be admissible&para;<br>in order for the expert’s opinion based on the facts and&para;<br>data to be admitted). As the Court notes, ante, at 12, the&para;<br>State does not assert that Razatos offered an independent,&para;<br>expert opinion about Bullcoming’s blood alcohol concentra­&para;<br>tion. Rather, the State explains, “[a]side from reading a&para;<br>report that was introduced as an exhibit, Mr. Razatos&para;<br>offered no opinion about Petitioner’s blood alcohol content&para;<br>. . . .” Brief for Respondent 58, n. 15 (citation omitted).&para;<br>Here the State offered the BAC report, including Caylor’s&para;<br>testimonial statements, into evidence. We would face a&para;<br>different question if asked to determine the constitutional­&para;<br>ity of allowing an expert witness to discuss others’ testi­&para;<br>monial statements if the testimonial statements were not&para;<br>themselves admitted as evidence.&para;<br>Finally, this is not a case in which the State introduced&para;<br>only machine-generated results, such as a printout from a&para;<br>gas chromatograph. The State here introduced Caylor’s&para;<br>statements, which included his transcription of a blood&para;<br>alcohol concentration, apparently copied from a gas chro­&para;<br>matograph printout, along with other statements about&para;<br>the procedures used in handling the blood sample. See&para;<br>ante, at 10; App. 62 (“I certify that I followed the proce­&para;<br>dures set out on the reverse of this report, and the state­&para;<br>ments in this block are correct”). Thus, we do not decide&para;<br>whether, as the New Mexico Supreme Court suggests, 226&para;<br>P. 3d, at 10, a State could introduce (assuming an ade­&para;<br>quate chain of custody foundation) raw data generated by&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

It is therefore tes­&para;<br>timonial, and the trial court erred in allowing the State&para;<br>to introduce it into evidence via Razatos’ testimony.

Far from replacing&para;<br>live testimony with “systematic” and “extrajudicial” ex&para;<br>aminations, Davis v. Washington, 547 U.

Here, the defense used the opportu&para;<br>nity in cross-examination to highlight the absence at trial&para;<br>of certain laboratory employees.

App. 58. After weighing arguments from de&para;<br>fense counsel concerning these admissions, and after con&para;<br>sidering the testimony of Mr. Razatos, who knew the&para;<br>laboratory’s protocols and processes, the jury found no&para;<br>reasonable doubt as to the defendant’s guilt.&para;<br>In these circumstances, requiring the State to call the&para;<br>technician who filled out a form and recorded the results&para;<br>of a test is a hollow formality. The defense remains free to&para;<br>challenge any and all forensic evidence. It may call and&para;<br>examine the technician who performed a test. And it may&para;<br>call other expert witnesses to explain that tests are not&para;<br>always reliable or that the technician might have made a&para;<br>mistake.

S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>dissenting).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The protections in the Confrontation Clause, and indeed&para;<br>the Sixth Amendment in general, are designed to ensure&para;<br>a fair trial with reliable evidence. But the Crawford v.&para;<br>Washington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004), line of cases has treated&para;<br>the reliability of evidence as a reason to exclude it. Id., at&para;<br>61–62. Today, for example, the Court bars admission of a&para;<br>lab report because it “is formalized in a signed document.”&para;<br>Ante, at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted). The&para;<br>Court’s unconventional and unstated premise is that&para;<br>the State—by acting to ensure a statement’s reliability—&para;<br>makes the statement more formal and therefore less likely&para;<br>to be admitted. Park, Is Confrontation the Bottom Line?&para;<br>19 Regent U. L. Rev. 459, 461 (2007). That is so, the&para;<br>Court insists, because reliability does not animate the&para;<br>Confrontation Clause. Ante, at 11; Melendez-Diaz, supra,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 11–12); Crawford, supra, at 61–62. Yet&para;<br>just this Term the Court ruled that, in another confronta&para;<br>tion context, reliability was an essential part of the consti&para;<br>tutional inquiry. See Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___–___, ___–___ (2010) (slip op., at 11–12, 14–15).&para;<br>Like reliability, other principles have weaved in and out&para;<br>of the Crawford jurisprudence. Solemnity has sometimes&para;<br>been dispositive, see Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 6); id., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (THOMAS, J., concur&para;<br>ring), and sometimes not, see Davis, 547 U. S., at 834–837,&para;<br>841 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and&para;<br>dissenting in part). So, too, with the elusive distinction&para;<br>between utterances aimed at proving past events, and&para;<br>those calculated to help police keep the peace. Compare&para;<br>Davis, supra, and Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at&para;<br>24–30), with id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 5–9) (SCALIA, J.,&para;<br>dissenting).&para;<br>It is not even clear which witnesses’ testimony could&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>render a scientific report admissible under the Court’s&para;<br>approach. Melendez-Diaz stated an inflexible rule: Where&para;<br>“analysts’ affidavits” included “testimonial statements,”&para;<br>defendants were “entitled to be confronted with the ana&para;<br>lysts” themselves. 557 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (inter&para;<br>nal quotation marks omitted). Now, the Court reveals,&para;<br>this rule is either less clear than it first appeared or too&para;<br>strict to be followed. A report is admissible, today’s opin&para;<br>ion states, if a “live witness competent to testify to the&para;<br>truth of the statements made in the report” appears. Ante,&para;<br>at 1. Such witnesses include not just the certifying ana&para;<br>lyst, but also any “scientist who . . . perform[ed] or ob&para;<br>serve[d] the test reported in the certification.” Ante, at 2.&para;<br>Today’s majority is not committed in equal shares to a&para;<br>common set of principles in applying the holding of Craw&para;<br>ford. Compare Davis, supra (opinion for the Court by&para;<br>SCALIA, J.), with id., at 834 (THOMAS, J., concurring in&para;<br>judgment in part and dissenting in part); and Bryant,&para;<br>supra, (opinion for the Court by SOTOMAYOR, J.), with id.,&para;<br>at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment), and id., at&para;<br>___ (SCALIA, J., dissenting), and id., at ___ (GINSBURG, J.,&para;<br>dissenting); and ante, at ___ (slip op., at 1) (opinion of the&para;<br>Court), with ante, at ___ (slip op., at 1) (SOTOMAYOR, J.,&para;<br>concurring). That the Court in the wake of Crawford has&para;<br>had such trouble fashioning a clear vision of that case’s&para;<br>meaning is unsettling; for Crawford binds every judge in&para;<br>every criminal trial in every local, state, and federal court&para;<br>in the Nation. This Court’s prior decisions leave trial&para;<br>judges to “guess what future rules this Court will distill&para;<br>from the sparse constitutional text,” Melendez-Diaz, supra,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 2) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting), or to strug&para;<br>gle to apply an “amorphous, if not entirely subjective,”&para;<br>“highly context-dependent inquiry” involving “open-ended&para;<br>balancing.” Bryant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 15–16)&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted)&para;<br>(listing 11 factors relevant under the majority’s approach).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>The persistent ambiguities in the Court’s approach are&para;<br>symptomatic of a rule not amenable to sensible applica&para;<br>tions. Procedures involving multiple participants illus&para;<br>trate the problem. In Melendez-Diaz the Court insisted&para;<br>that its opinion did not require everyone in the chain of&para;<br>custody to testify but then qualified that “what testimony&para;<br>is introduced must . . . be introduced live.” 557 U. S.,&para;<br>at ___, n. 1 (slip op., at 5, n. 1); ante, at 6, n. 2. This&para;<br>could mean that a statement that evidence remained in&para;<br>law-enforcement custody is admissible if the statement’s&para;<br>maker appears in court. If so, an intern at police head&para;<br>quarters could review the evidence log, declare that chain&para;<br>of custody was retained, and so testify. The rule could also&para;<br>be that that the intern’s statement—which draws on&para;<br>statements in the evidence log—is inadmissible unless&para;<br>every officer who signed the log appears at trial. That&para;<br>rule, if applied to this case, would have conditioned admis&para;<br>sibility of the report on the testimony of three or more&para;<br>identified witnesses. See App. 62. In other instances, 7 or&para;<br>even 40 witnesses could be required. See supra, at 3. The&para;<br>court has thus—in its fidelity to Melendez-Diaz—boxed&para;<br>itself into a choice of evils: render the Confrontation&para;<br>Clause pro forma or construe it so that its dictates are&para;<br>unworkable.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Crawford itself does not compel today’s conclusion. It&para;<br>is true, as Crawford confirmed, that the Confrontation&para;<br>Clause seeks in part to bar the government from replicat&para;<br>ing trial procedures outside of public view. See 541 U. S.,&para;<br>at 50; Bryant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11–12). Crawford&para;<br>explained that the basic purpose of the Clause was to&para;<br>address the sort of abuses exemplified at the notorious&para;<br>treason trial of Sir Walter Raleigh. 541 U. S., at 51. On&para;<br>this view the Clause operates to bar admission of out-of&para;<br>court statements obtained through formal interrogation in&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>preparation for trial. The danger is that innocent defen&para;<br>dants may be convicted on the basis of unreliable, un&para;<br>tested statements by those who observed—or claimed to&para;<br>have observed—preparation for or commission of the&para;<br>crime. And, of course, those statements might not have&para;<br>been uttered at all or—even if spoken—might not have&para;<br>been true.&para;<br>A rule that bars testimony of that sort, however, pro&para;<br>vides neither cause nor necessity to impose a constitu&para;<br>tional bar on the admission of impartial lab reports like&para;<br>the instant one, reports prepared by experienced techni&para;<br>cians in laboratories that follow professional norms and&para;<br>scientific protocols. In addition to the constitutional right&para;<br>to call witnesses in his own defense, the defendant in this&para;<br>case was already protected by checks on potential prosecu&para;<br>torial abuse such as free retesting for defendants; result&para;<br>blind issuance of reports; testing by an independent&para;<br>agency; routine processes performed en masse, which&para;<br>reduce opportunities for targeted bias; and labs operating&para;<br>pursuant to scientific and professional norms and over&para;<br>sight. See Brief for Respondent 5, 14–15, 41, 54; New&para;<br>Mexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 2, 26.&para;<br>In addition to preventing the State from conducting ex&para;<br>parte trials, Crawford’s rejection of the regime of Ohio v.&para;<br>Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), seemed to have two under&para;<br>lying jurisprudential objectives. One was to delink the&para;<br>intricacies of hearsay law from a constitutional mandate;&para;<br>and the other was to allow the States, in their own courts&para;<br>and legislatures and without this Court’s supervision, to&para;<br>explore and develop sensible, specific evidentiary rules&para;<br>pertaining to the admissibility of certain statements.&para;<br>These results were to be welcomed, for this Court lacks&para;<br>the experience and day-to-day familiarity with the trial&para;<br>process to suit it well to assume the role of national tribu&para;<br>nal for rules of evidence. Yet far from pursuing these&para;<br>objectives, the Court rejects them in favor of their oppo&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sites.&para;<br>Instead of freeing the Clause from reliance on hearsay&para;<br>doctrines, the Court has now linked the Clause with hear&para;<br>say rules in their earliest, most rigid, and least refined&para;<br>formulations. See, e.g., Mosteller, Remaking Confronta&para;<br>tion Clause and Hearsay Doctrine Under the Challenge&para;<br>of Child Sexual Abuse Prosecutions, 1993 U. Ill. L. Rev.&para;<br>691, 739–740, 742, 744–746; Gallanis, The Rise of Modern&para;<br>Evidence Law, 84 Iowa L. Rev. 499, 502–503, 514–515,&para;<br>533–537 (1999). In cases like Melendez-Diaz and this one,&para;<br>the Court has tied the Confrontation Clause to 18th cen&para;<br>tury hearsay rules unleavened by principles tending to&para;<br>make those rules more sensible. Sklansky, Hearsay’s Last&para;<br>Hurrah, 2009 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 5–6, 36. As a result, the Court&para;<br>has taken the Clause far beyond its most important ap&para;<br>plication, which is to forbid sworn, ex parte, out-of-court&para;<br>statements by unconfronted and available witnesses who&para;<br>observed the crime and do not appear at trial.&para;<br>Second, the States are not just at risk of having some of&para;<br>their hearsay rules reviewed by this Court. They often are&para;<br>foreclosed now from contributing to the formulation and&para;<br>enactment of rules that make trials fairer and more reli&para;<br>able. For instance, recent state laws allowing admission&para;<br>of well-documented and supported reports of abuse by&para;<br>women whose abusers later murdered them must give&para;<br>way, unless that abuser murdered with the specific pur&para;<br>pose of foreclosing the testimony. Giles v. California, 554&para;<br>U. S. 353 (2008); Sklansky, supra, at 14–15. Whether&para;<br>those statutes could provide sufficient indicia of reliability&para;<br>and other safeguards to comply with the Confrontation&para;<br>Clause as it should be understood is, to be sure, an open&para;<br>question. The point is that the States cannot now partici&para;<br>pate in the development of this difficult part of the law.&para;<br>In short, there is an ongoing, continued, and systemic&para;<br>displacement of the States and dislocation of the federal&para;<br>structure. Cf. Melendez-Diaz, supra, at ___, ___, ___ (slip&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BULLCOMING v. NEW MEXICO&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>op., at 2–3, 22–23). If this Court persists in applying&para;<br>wooden formalism in order to bar reliable testimony of&para;<br>fered by the prosecution—testimony thought proper for&para;<br>many decades in state and federal courts committed to&para;<br>devising fair trial processes—then the States might find it&para;<br>necessary and appropriate to enact statutes to accommo&para;<br>date this new, intrusive federal regime. If they do, those&para;<br>rules could remain on State statute books for decades,&para;<br>even if subsequent decisions of this Court were to better&para;<br>implement the objectives of Crawford. This underscores&para;<br>the disruptive, long-term structural consequences of deci&para;<br>sions like the one the Court announces today.&para;<br>States also may decide it is proper and appropriate to&para;<br>enact statutes that require defense counsel to give ad&para;<br>vance notice if they are going to object to introduction of a&para;<br>report without the presence in court of the technician who&para;<br>prepared it. Indeed, today’s opinion relies upon laws of&para;<br>that sort as a palliative to the disruption it is causing.&para;<br>Ante, at 17 (plurality opinion). It is quite unrealistic,&para;<br>however, to think that this will take away from the de&para;<br>fense the incentives to insist on having the certifying&para;<br>analyst present. There is in the ordinary case that pro&para;<br>ceeds to trial no good reason for defense counsel to waive&para;<br>the right of confrontation as the Court now interprets it.&para;<br>Today’s opinion repeats an assertion from MelendezDiaz that its decision will not “impose an undue burden on&para;<br>the prosecution.” Ante, at 16 (plurality opinion). But&para;<br>evidence to the contrary already has begun to mount. See,&para;<br>e.g., Brief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 7&para;<br>(explaining that the 10 toxicologists for the Los Angeles&para;<br>Police Department spent 782 hours at 261 court appear&para;<br>ances during a 1-year period); Brief for National District&para;<br>Attorneys Assocation et al. as Amici Curiae 23 (observing&para;<br>that each blood-alcohol analyst in California processes&para;<br>3,220 cases per year on average). New and more rigorous&para;<br>empirical studies further detailing the unfortunate effects&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>of Melendez-Diaz are sure to be forthcoming.&para;<br>In the meantime, New Mexico’s experience exemplifies&para;<br>the problems ahead. From 2008 to 2010, subpoenas re&para;<br>quiring New Mexico analysts to testify in impaired-driving&para;<br>cases rose 71%, to 1,600—or 8 or 9 every workday. New&para;<br>Mexico Scientific Laboratory Brief 2. In a State that is the&para;<br>Nation’s fifth largest by area and that employs just 10&para;<br>total analysts, id., at 3, each analyst in blood alcohol cases&para;<br>recently received 200 subpoenas per year, id., at 33. The&para;<br>analysts now must travel great distances on most working&para;<br>days. The result has been, in the laboratory’s words,&para;<br>“chaotic.” Id., at 5. And if the defense raises an objection&para;<br>and the analyst is tied up in another court proceeding; or&para;<br>on leave; or absent; or delayed in transit; or no longer&para;<br>employed; or ill; or no longer living, the defense gets a&para;<br>windfall. As a result, good defense attorneys will object in&para;<br>ever-greater numbers to a prosecution failure or inability&para;<br>to produce laboratory analysts at trial. The concomitant&para;<br>increases in subpoenas will further impede the state labo&para;<br>ratory’s ability to keep pace with its obligations. Scarce&para;<br>state resources could be committed to other urgent needs&para;<br>in the criminal justice system.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Seven years after its initiation, it bears remembering&para;<br>that the Crawford approach was not preordained. This&para;<br>Court’s missteps have produced an interpretation of the&para;<br>word “witness” at odds with its meaning elsewhere in the&para;<br>Constitution, including elsewhere in the Sixth Amend&para;<br>ment, see Amar, Sixth Amendment First Principles, 84&para;<br>Geo. L. J. 641, 647, 691–696 (1996), and at odds with&para;<br>the sound administration of justice. It is time to return&para;<br>to solid ground. A proper place to begin that return is to&para;<br>decline to extend Melendez-Diaz to bar the reliable, com&para;<br>monsense evidentiary framework the State sought to&para;<br>follow in this case.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
