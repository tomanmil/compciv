S.

As relevant here,&para;<br>service-station franchisees (dealers) filed suit under the Act, alleging&para;<br>that a petroleum franchisor and its assignee had constructively “ter&para;<br>minate[d]” their franchises and constructively “fail[ed] to renew”&para;<br>their franchise relationships by substantially changing the rental&para;<br>terms that the dealers had enjoyed for years, increasing costs for&para;<br>many of them. The dealers asserted these claims even though they&para;<br>had not been compelled to abandon their franchises, and even though&para;<br>they had been offered and had accepted renewal agreements. The&para;<br>jury found against the franchisor and assignee, and the District&para;<br>Court denied their requests for judgment as a matter of law. The&para;<br>First Circuit affirmed as to the constructive termination claims, hold&para;<br>ing that the Act does not require a franchisee to abandon its fran&para;<br>chise to recover for such termination, and concluding that a simple&para;<br>breach of contract by an assignee of a franchise agreement can&para;<br>amount to constructive termination if the breach resulted in a mate&para;<br>rial change effectively ending the lease.

SHELL OIL &para;<br>&para;<br>PRODUCTS CO.&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>renewal agreement.&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. A franchisee cannot recover for constructive termination under&para;<br>the Act if the franchisor’s allegedly wrongful conduct did not compel&para;<br>the franchisee to abandon its franchise. Pp. 6–15.&para;<br>(a) The Act provides that “no franchisor . . . may . . . terminate&para;<br>any franchise,” except for an enumerated reason and after giving&para;<br>written notice, §2802(a)–(b), and specifies that “ ‘termination’ in&para;<br>cludes cancellation,” §2801(17). Because it does not further define&para;<br>those terms, they are given their ordinary meanings: “put [to] an&para;<br>end” or “annul[ed] or destroy[ed].” Thus, the Act prohibits only fran&para;<br>chisor conduct that has the effect of ending a franchise. The same&para;<br>conclusion follows even if Congress used “terminate” and “cancel” in&para;<br>their technical, rather than ordinary, senses. This conclusion is also&para;<br>consistent with the general understanding of the constructive termi&para;<br>nation doctrine as applied in analogous legal contexts—e.g., employ&para;<br>ment law, see Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129,&para;<br>141–143—where a termination is deemed “constructive” only because&para;<br>the plaintiff, not the defendant, formally ends a particular legal rela&para;<br>tionship—not because there is no end to the relationship at all. Al&para;<br>lowing franchisees to obtain relief for conduct that does not force a&para;<br>franchise to end would ignore the Act’s scope, which is limited to the&para;<br>circumstances in which franchisors may terminate a franchise or de&para;<br>cline to renew a franchise relationship and leaves undisturbed state&para;<br>law regulation of other types of disputes between petroleum franchi&para;<br>sors and franchisees, see §2806(a). This conclusion is also informed&para;<br>by important practical considerations, namely, that any standard for&para;<br>identifying those breaches of contract that should be treated as effec&para;<br>tively ending a franchise, even though the franchisee continues to op&para;<br>erate, would be indeterminate and unworkable. Pp. 6–12.&para;<br>(b) The dealers’ claim that this interpretation of the Act fails to&para;<br>provide franchisees with protection from unfair and coercive franchi&para;<br>sor conduct that does not force an end to the franchise ignores the&para;<br>availability of state-law remedies to address such wrongful conduct.&para;<br>The Court’s reading of the Act is also faithful to the statutory inter&para;<br>pretation principle that statutes should be construed “in a manner&para;<br>that gives effect to all of their provisions,” United States ex rel. Eisen&para;<br>stein v. City of New York, 556 U. S. ___, ___, because this interpreta&para;<br>tion gives meaningful effect to the Act’s preliminary injunction provi&para;<br>sions and its alternative statute-of-limitations accrual dates. Pp. 12–&para;<br>14.&para;<br>2. A franchisee who signs and operates under a renewal agreement&para;<br>with a franchisor may not maintain a constructive nonrenewal claim&para;<br>under the Act. The Act’s text leaves no room for such an interpreta&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>tion. It is violated only when a franchisor “fail[s] to renew” a fran&para;<br>chise relationship for an enumerated reason or fails to provide the&para;<br>required notice, see §2802, and it defines “fail to renew” as a “failure&para;<br>to reinstate, continue, or extend the franchise relationship,”&para;<br>§2801(14). A franchisee that signs a renewal agreement cannot carry&para;<br>the threshold burden of showing a “nonrenewal of the franchise rela&para;<br>tionship,” §2805(c), and thus necessarily cannot establish that the&para;<br>franchisor has violated the Act. Signing their renewal agreements&para;<br>“under protest” did not preserve the dealers’ ability to assert nonre&para;<br>newal claims. When a franchisee signs a renewal agreement—even&para;<br>“under protest”—there has been no “fail[ure] to renew,” and thus no&para;<br>violation of the Act. The Act’s structure and purpose confirm this in&para;<br>terpretation. Accepting the dealers’ contrary reading would greatly&para;<br>expand the Act’s reach.

In these consolidated cases, service-station fran&para;<br>chisees brought suit under the Act, alleging that a fran&para;<br>chisor had constructively “terminate[d]” their franchises&para;<br>and had constructively “fail[ed] to renew” their franchise&para;<br>relationships. They asserted these claims even though the&para;<br>conduct of which they complained had not compelled any&para;<br>of them to abandon their franchises and even though they&para;<br>had been offered and had accepted renewal agreements.&para;<br>We hold that a franchisee cannot recover for constructive&para;<br>termination under the PMPA if the franchisor’s allegedly&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v.

Additionally, we conclude that a fran&para;<br>chisee who signs and operates under a renewal agreement&para;<br>with a franchisor may not maintain a claim for construc&para;<br>tive nonrenewal. We therefore reverse in part and affirm&para;<br>in part.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Petroleum refiners and distributors supply motor fuel to&para;<br>the public through service stations that often are operated&para;<br>by independent franchisees. In the typical franchise&para;<br>arrangement, the franchisor leases the service-station&para;<br>premises to the franchisee, grants the franchisee the right&para;<br>to use the franchisor’s trademark, and agrees to sell motor&para;<br>fuel to the franchisee for resale. Franchise agreements&para;<br>remain in effect for a stated term, after which the parties&para;<br>can opt to renew the franchise relationship by executing a&para;<br>new agreement.&para;<br>Enacted in 1978, the PMPA was a response to wide&para;<br>spread concern over increasing numbers of allegedly un&para;<br>fair franchise terminations and nonrenewals in the petro&para;<br>leum industry. See, e.g., Comment, 1980 Duke L. J. 522,&para;<br>524–531. The Act establishes minimum federal standards&para;<br>governing the termination and nonrenewal of petroleum&para;<br>franchises. Under the Act’s operative provisions, a fran&para;<br>chisor may “terminate” a “franchise” during the term&para;<br>stated in the franchise agreement and may “fail to renew”&para;<br>a “franchise relationship” at the conclusion of that term&para;<br>only if the franchisor provides written notice and takes the&para;<br>action in question for a reason specifically recognized in&para;<br>the statute. 15 U. S. C. §§2802, 2804. Consistent with the&para;<br>typical franchise arrangement, a “franchise” is defined as&para;<br>“any contract” that authorizes a franchisee to use the&para;<br>franchisor’s trademark, as well as any associated agree&para;<br>ment providing for the supply of motor fuel or authorizing&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the franchisee to occupy a service station owned by the&para;<br>franchisor.1 §2801(1). The Act defines a “franchise rela&para;<br>tionship” in more general terms: the parties’ “respective&para;<br>motor fuel marketing or distribution obligations and re&para;<br>sponsibilities” that result from the franchise arrangement.&para;<br>§2801(2).&para;<br>To enforce these provisions, a franchisee may bring suit&para;<br>in federal court against any franchisor that fails to comply&para;<br>with the Act’s restrictions on terminations and nonrenew&para;<br>als. See §2805. Successful franchisees can benefit from a&para;<br>wide range of remedies, including compensatory and&para;<br>punitive damages, reasonable attorney’s fees and expert&para;<br>costs, and equitable relief. See §2805(b), (d). The Act also&para;<br>requires district courts to grant preliminary injunctive&para;<br>relief to aggrieved franchisees, if there are “sufficiently&para;<br>serious questions going to the merits” that present “a fair&para;<br>ground for litigation” and the balance of hardships favors&para;<br>such relief. §2805(b)(2).&para;<br>B&para;<br>This litigation involves a dispute between Shell Oil&para;<br>Company (Shell), a petroleum franchisor, and several&para;<br>Shell franchisees in Massachusetts.2 Pursuant to their&para;<br>franchise agreements with Shell, each franchisee was&para;<br>required to pay Shell monthly rent for use of the service&para;<br>station premises. For many years, Shell offered the fran&para;<br>chisees a rent subsidy that reduced the monthly rent by a&para;<br>set amount for every gallon of motor fuel a franchisee sold&para;<br>above a specified threshold. Shell renewed the subsidy&para;<br>annually through notices that “explicitly provided for&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Courts sometimes describe these three types of agreements as the&para;<br>“statutory elements” of a petroleum franchise. See, e.g., Marcoux v.&para;<br>Shell Oil Prods. Co., 524 F. 3d 33, 37, n. 1 (CA1 2008).&para;<br>2 Shell Oil Products Company LLC, another party in this litigation, is&para;<br>a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell Oil Company.

Shell Oil Prods. Co., 524 F. 3d 33, 38 (CA1&para;<br>2008). Nonetheless, Shell representatives made various&para;<br>oral representations to the franchisees “that the [s]ubsidy&para;<br>or something like it would always exist.” Ibid.&para;<br>In 1998, Shell joined with two other oil companies to&para;<br>create Motiva Enterprises LLC (Motiva), a joint venture&para;<br>that combined the companies’ petroleum-marketing opera&para;<br>tions in the eastern United States. Id., at 37. Shell as&para;<br>signed to Motiva its rights and obligations under the&para;<br>relevant franchise agreements. Motiva, in turn, took two&para;<br>actions that led to this lawsuit. First, effective January 1,&para;<br>2000, Motiva ended the volume-based rent subsidy, thus&para;<br>increasing the franchisees’ rent. Id., at 38. Second, as&para;<br>each franchise agreement expired, Motiva offered the&para;<br>franchisees new agreements that contained a different&para;<br>formula for calculating rent. For some (but not all) of the&para;<br>franchisees, annual rent was greater under the new&para;<br>formula.&para;<br>C&para;<br>In July 2001, 63 Shell franchisees (hereinafter dealers)&para;<br>filed suit against Shell and Motiva in Federal District&para;<br>Court. Their complaint alleged that Motiva’s discontinua&para;<br>tion of the rent subsidy constituted a breach of contract&para;<br>under state law. Additionally, the dealers asserted two&para;<br>claims under the PMPA. First, they maintained that Shell&para;<br>and Motiva, by eliminating the rent subsidy, had “con&para;<br>structively terminated” their franchises in violation of the&para;<br>Act. Second, they claimed that Motiva’s offer of new fran&para;<br>chise agreements that calculated rent using a different&para;<br>formula amounted to a “constructive nonrenewal” of their&para;<br>franchise relationships.3&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The dealers also claimed that Shell and Motiva had violated the&para;<br>Uniform Commercial Code, as adopted in Massachusetts, by setting&para;<br>unreasonable prices under the open-price terms of their fuel-supply&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>After a 2-week trial involving eight of the dealers, the&para;<br>jury found against Shell and Motiva on all claims. Both&para;<br>before and after the jury’s verdict, Shell and Motiva moved&para;<br>for judgment as a matter of law on the dealers’ two PMPA&para;<br>claims. They argued that they could not be found liable&para;<br>for constructive termination under the Act because none of&para;<br>the dealers had abandoned their franchises in response to&para;<br>Motiva’s elimination of the rent subsidy––something Shell&para;<br>and Motiva said was a necessary element of any construc&para;<br>tive termination claim. Similarly, they argued that the&para;<br>dealers’ constructive nonrenewal claims necessarily failed&para;<br>because seven of the eight dealers had signed and oper&para;<br>ated under renewal agreements with Motiva, and the&para;<br>eighth had sold his franchise prior to the expiration of his&para;<br>franchise agreement. The District Court denied these&para;<br>motions, and Shell and Motiva appealed.&para;<br>The First Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.&para;<br>In affirming the judgment on the dealers’ constructive&para;<br>termination claims, the Court of Appeals held that a fran&para;<br>chisee is not required to abandon its franchise to recover&para;<br>for constructive termination under the PMPA. See 524&para;<br>F. 3d, at 45–47. Instead, the court ruled, a simple breach&para;<br>of contract by an assignee of a franchise agreement can&para;<br>amount to constructive termination under the Act, so long&para;<br>as the breach resulted in “such a material change that it&para;<br>effectively ended the lease, even though the [franchisee]&para;<br>continued to operate [its franchise].” Id., at 46 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). Turning to the dealers’ con&para;<br>structive nonrenewal claims, the First Circuit agreed with&para;<br>Shell and Motiva that a franchisee cannot maintain a&para;<br>claim for unlawful nonrenewal under the PMPA “where&para;<br>the franchisee has signed and operates under the renewal&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>agreements with the dealers. The jury found in favor of the dealers on &para;<br>&para;<br>this claim, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 524 F. 3d, at 51.

SHELL OIL &para;<br>&para;<br>PRODUCTS CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>agreement complained of.” Id., at 49. The court thus&para;<br>reversed the judgment on those claims.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. See 557 U. S. ___ (2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The first question we are asked to decide is whether a&para;<br>service-station franchisee may recover for constructive&para;<br>termination under the PMPA when the franchisor’s alleg&para;<br>edly wrongful conduct did not force the franchisee to&para;<br>abandon its franchise. For the reasons that follow, we&para;<br>conclude that a necessary element of any constructive&para;<br>termination claim under the Act is that the franchisor’s&para;<br>conduct forced an end to the franchisee’s use of the fran&para;<br>chisor’s trademark, purchase of the franchisor’s fuel, or&para;<br>occupation of the franchisor’s service station.4&para;<br>A&para;<br>When given its ordinary meaning, the text of the PMPA&para;<br>prohibits only that franchisor conduct that has the effect&para;<br>of ending a franchise. As relevant here, the Act provides&para;<br>that “no franchisor . . . may . . . terminate any franchise,”&para;<br>except for an enumerated reason and after providing&para;<br>written notice. 15 U. S. C. §2802(a)–(b). The Act specifies&para;<br>that “[t]he term ‘termination’ includes cancellation,”&para;<br>§2801(17), but it does not further define the term “termi&para;<br>nate” or the incorporated term “cancel.” We therefore give&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Because&para;<br>&para;<br>resolving this question is sufficient to decide these cases,&para;<br>we need not address Shell and Motiva’s alternative argument that the&para;<br>PMPA does not embrace claims for constructive termination at all.&para;<br>Several Courts of Appeals have held that the Act does create a cause of&para;<br>action for constructive termination. See, e.g., 524 F. 3d, at 44–45 (case&para;<br>below); Clark v. BP Oil Co., 137 F. 3d 386, 390–391 (CA6 1998); Shukla&para;<br>v. BP Exploration &amp; Oil, Inc., 115 F. 3d 849, 852–853 (CA11 1997).&para;<br>Others have reserved judgment on the issue. See, e.g., Abrams Shell v.&para;<br>Shell Oil Co., 343 F. 3d 482, 486–488 (CA5 2003); Portland 76&para;<br>Auto/Truck Plaza, Inc. v. Union Oil Co. of Cal., 153 F. 3d 938, 948&para;<br>(CA9 1998). We leave the question for another day.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>those terms their ordinary meanings. See Asgrow Seed&para;<br>Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187 (1995).&para;<br>The word “terminate” ordinarily means “put an end to.”&para;<br>Webster’s New International Dictionary 2605 (2d ed.&para;<br>1957); see also The Random House Dictionary of the Eng&para;<br>lish Language 1465 (1967). The term “cancel” carries a&para;<br>similar meaning: to “annul or destroy.” Webster’s, supra,&para;<br>at 389; see also Random House, supra, at 215 (“to make&para;<br>void; revoke; annul”). The object of the verb “terminate” is&para;<br>the noun “franchise,” a term the Act defines as “any con&para;<br>tract” for the provision of one (or more) of the three ele&para;<br>ments of a typical petroleum franchise. §2801(1). Thus,&para;<br>when given its ordinary meaning, the Act is violated only&para;<br>if an agreement for the use of a trademark, purchase of&para;<br>motor fuel, or lease of a premises is “put [to] an end” or&para;<br>“annul[ed] or destroy[ed].” Conduct that does not force an&para;<br>end to the franchise, in contrast, is not prohibited by the&para;<br>Act’s plain terms.&para;<br>The same conclusion follows even if Congress was using&para;<br>the words “terminate” and “cancel” in their technical,&para;<br>rather than ordinary, senses. When Congress enacted the&para;<br>PMPA, those terms had established meanings under the&para;<br>Uniform Commercial Code.5&para;<br>Under both definitions,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The&para;<br>&para;<br>difference between a “termination” and a “cancellation” under&para;<br>the Uniform Commercial Code relates to how the contracting party&para;<br>justifies its ending of the contractual relationship. A “termination”&para;<br>occurs when “either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or&para;<br>law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach.” U. C. C.&para;<br>§2–106(3) (1972 ed.). By contrast, a “cancellation” occurs when “either&para;<br>party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other.” §2–106(4).&para;<br>That difference might well explain why Congress felt compelled to&para;<br>specify that “cancellation[s],” no less than “termination[s],” are covered&para;<br>by the Act. Prior to the PMPA, franchisors often leveraged their&para;<br>greater bargaining power to end franchise agreements for minor or&para;<br>technical breaches by the franchisee. See, e.g., Chestnut Hill Gulf, Inc.&para;<br>v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., 940 F. 2d 744, 746–747 (CA1 1991). By&para;<br>specifying that the Act covers “cancellation[s]” as well as “termina&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v.

Thus, a fran&para;<br>chisee who continues operating a franchise—occupying the&para;<br>same premises, receiving the same fuel, and using the&para;<br>same trademark—has not had the franchise “termi&para;<br>nate[d]” in either the ordinary or technical sense of the&para;<br>word.&para;<br>Requiring franchisees to abandon their franchises before&para;<br>claiming constructive termination is also consistent with&para;<br>the general understanding of the doctrine of constructive&para;<br>termination. As applied in analogous legal contexts—both&para;<br>now and at the time Congress enacted the PMPA—a&para;<br>plaintiff must actually sever a particular legal relationship&para;<br>in order to maintain a claim for constructive termination.&para;<br>For example, courts have long recognized a theory of&para;<br>constructive discharge in the field of employment law. See&para;<br>Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129, 141–&para;<br>143 (2004) (tracing the doctrine to the 1930’s). To recover&para;<br>for constructive discharge, however, an employee gener&para;<br>ally is required to quit his or her job. See 1 B. Lindemann&para;<br>&amp; P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 1449&para;<br>(4th ed. 2007); 3 L. Larson, Labor and Employment Law&para;<br>§59.05[8] (2009); 2 EEOC Compliance Manual §612.9(a)&para;<br>(2008); cf.

United States Steel Corp., 509 F. 2d 923,&para;<br>929 (CA10 1975). Similarly, landlord-tenant law has long&para;<br>recognized the concept of constructive eviction. See Ra&para;<br>pacz, Origin and Evolution of Constructive Eviction in the&para;<br>United States, 1 DePaul L. Rev. 69 (1951). The general&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>tion[s],” Congress foreclosed any argument that a termination for &para;<br>&para;<br>breach is not covered by the Act because it is technically a “cancella&para;<br>&para;<br>tion” rather than a “termination.” &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Tiffany, Real Property §§141, 143 (3d ed.&para;<br>1939).6&para;<br>As generally understood in these and other contexts, a&para;<br>termination is deemed “constructive” because it is the&para;<br>plaintiff, rather than the defendant, who formally puts an&para;<br>end to the particular legal relationship—not because there&para;<br>is no end to the relationship at all. There is no reason why&para;<br>a different understanding should apply to constructive&para;<br>termination claims under the PMPA. At the time when it&para;<br>enacted the statute, Congress presumably was aware of&para;<br>how courts applied the doctrine of constructive termina&para;<br>tion in these analogous legal contexts. See Fitzgerald v.&para;<br>Barnstable School Comm., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip&para;<br>op, at 11–12). And in the absence of any contrary evi&para;<br>dence, we think it reasonable to interpret the Act in a way&para;<br>that is consistent with this well-established body of law.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals was of the view that analogizing to&para;<br>doctrines of constructive termination in other contexts was&para;<br>inappropriate because “sunk costs, optimism, and the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 Before&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress enacted the PMPA, at least one court, it is true,&para;<br>had held that a tenant asserting constructive eviction could obtain&para;<br>declaratory relief without abandoning the premises—although the court&para;<br>observed that the tenant still would have to abandon the premises in&para;<br>order to obtain rescission. See Charles E. Burt, Inc. v. Seven Grand&para;<br>Corp., 340 Mass. 124, 129–130, 163 N. E. 2d 4, 7–8 (1959). But as even&para;<br>the dealers concede, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 37–38, the clear majority of&para;<br>authority required a tenant to leave the premises before claiming&para;<br>constructive eviction.&para;<br>For similar reasons, the Second Restatement of Property is of no help&para;<br>to the dealers. Although it would allow a tenant to bring a constructive&para;<br>eviction claim without moving out, it noted that this proposition was&para;<br>“contrary to the present weight of judicial authority.” 1 Restatement&para;<br>(Second) of Property §6.1, Reporter’s Note 1, p. 230 (1976).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v.

But surely these same factors compel em&para;<br>ployees and tenants—no less than service-station franchi&para;<br>sees—to try to make their changed arrangements work.&para;<br>Nonetheless, courts have long required plaintiffs asserting&para;<br>such claims to show an actual severance of the relevant&para;<br>legal relationship. We see no reason for a different rule&para;<br>here.&para;<br>Additionally, allowing franchisees to obtain PMPA relief&para;<br>for conduct that does not force an end to a franchise would&para;<br>extend the reach of the Act much further than its text and&para;<br>structure suggest. Prior to 1978, the regulation of petro&para;<br>leum franchise agreements was largely a matter of state&para;<br>law. See Dersch Energies, Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 F. 3d&para;<br>846, 861 (CA7 2002); Comment, 32 Emory L. J. 273, 277–&para;<br>283 (1983). In enacting the PMPA, Congress did not&para;<br>regulate every aspect of the petroleum franchise relation&para;<br>ship but instead federalized only the two parts of that&para;<br>relationship with which it was most concerned: the cir&para;<br>cumstances in which franchisors may terminate a fran&para;<br>chise or decline to renew a franchise relationship. See 15&para;<br>U. S. C. §2802; Dersch Energies, supra, at 861–862. Con&para;<br>gress left undisturbed state-law regulation of other types&para;<br>of disputes between petroleum franchisors and franchi&para;<br>sees. See §2806(a) (pre-empting only those state laws&para;<br>governing franchise terminations or nonrenewals).&para;<br>The dealers would have us interpret the PMPA in a&para;<br>manner that ignores the Act’s limited scope. On their&para;<br>view, and in the view of the Court of Appeals, the PMPA&para;<br>prohibits, not just unlawful terminations and nonrenew&para;<br>als, but also certain serious breaches of contract that do&para;<br>not cause an end to the franchise.

How is a court to determine&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 Adopting such a broad reading of the PMPA also would have serious&para;<br>implications for run-of-the-mill franchise disputes. The Act requires&para;<br>courts to award attorney’s fees and expert-witness fees in any case in&para;<br>which a plaintiff recovers more than nominal damages. See 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2805(d)(1)(C). The Act also permits punitive damages, §2805(d)(1)(B),&para;<br>a remedy ordinarily not available in breach-of-contract actions, see&para;<br>Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181, 187–188 (2002). Accepting the&para;<br>dealers’ reading of the statute, therefore, would turn everyday contract&para;<br>disputes into high-stakes affairs.&para;<br>8 The First Circuit, for example, approved of a test that asks whether&para;<br>the breach resulted in “such a material change that it effectively ended&para;<br>the lease, even though the plaintiffs continued to operate [their fran&para;<br>chises].” 524 F. 3d, at 46 (internal quotation marks omitted). That&para;<br>standard, it seems to us, does little more than restate the relevant&para;<br>question. While we do not decide whether the PMPA contemplates&para;<br>claims for constructive termination, we observe that the Court of&para;<br>Appeals’ unwillingness or inability to establish a more concrete stan&para;<br>dard underscores the difficulties and inherent contradictions involved&para;<br>in crafting a standard for finding a “termination” when no termination&para;<br>has in fact occurred.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v.

And how is a franchisor to know&para;<br>in advance which breaches a court will later determine to&para;<br>have been so serious? The dealers have not provided&para;<br>answers to these questions. Nor could they. Any standard&para;<br>for identifying when a simple breach of contract amounts&para;<br>to a PMPA termination, when all three statutory elements&para;<br>remain operational, simply evades coherent formulation.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The dealers suggest that this interpretation of the&para;<br>PMPA fails to provide franchisees with much-needed&para;<br>protection from unfair and coercive franchisor conduct&para;<br>that does not force an end to the franchise. That argu&para;<br>ment, however, ignores the fact that franchisees still have&para;<br>state-law remedies available to them. The pre-emptive&para;<br>scope of the PMPA is limited: The Act pre-empts only&para;<br>those state or local laws that govern the termination of&para;<br>petroleum franchises or the nonrenewal of petroleum&para;<br>franchise relationships. See 15 U. S. C. §2806(a). Outside&para;<br>of those areas, therefore, franchisees can still rely on&para;<br>state-law remedies to address wrongful franchisor conduct&para;<br>that does not have the effect of ending the franchise.&para;<br>Indeed, that happened in this very lawsuit. The dealers&para;<br>argued in the District Court that Motiva’s elimination of&para;<br>the rent subsidy not only constructively terminated their&para;<br>franchises in violation of the PMPA but also amounted to&para;<br>a breach of contract under state law. The jury found in&para;<br>their favor on their state-law claims and awarded them&para;<br>almost $1.3 million in damages. See App. 376–379. Thus,&para;<br>the dealers’ own experience demonstrates that franchisees&para;<br>do not need a PMPA remedy to have meaningful protec&para;<br>tion from abusive franchisor conduct.&para;<br>The dealers also charge that this interpretation of the&para;<br>PMPA cannot be correct because it renders other provi&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5)&para;<br>To begin, the dealers insist that our reading of the term&para;<br>“terminate” will require franchisees to go out of business&para;<br>before they can obtain preliminary relief and thus will&para;<br>render useless the Act’s preliminary injunction mecha&para;<br>nism. We disagree. To obtain a preliminary injunction, it&para;<br>is true, a franchisee must show, among other things, that&para;<br>“the franchise of which he is a party has been terminated.”&para;<br>15 U. S. C. §2805(b)(2)(A)(i) (emphasis added). But that&para;<br>does not necessarily mean that a franchisee must go out of&para;<br>business before obtaining an injunction. For example, in&para;<br>cases of actual termination, the Act requires franchisors to&para;<br>provide franchisees with written notice of termination well&para;<br>in advance of the date on which the termination “takes&para;<br>effect.” §2804(a). A franchisee that receives notice of&para;<br>termination “has been terminated” within the meaning of&para;<br>§2805(b)(2)(A)(i), even though the termination “takes&para;<br>effect” on a later date, just as an employee who receives&para;<br>notice of discharge can be accurately described as having&para;<br>been discharged, even though the employee’s last day at&para;<br>work may perhaps be weeks later. Thus, franchisees that&para;<br>receive notice of impending termination can invoke the&para;<br>protections of the Act’s preliminary injunction mechanism&para;<br>well before having to go out of business.9 Contrary to the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The Government reads the Act to permit a dealer to seek prelimi&para;<br>nary injunctive relief if a franchisor announces its “intent to engage in&para;<br>conduct that would leave the franchisee no reasonable alternative but&para;<br>to abandon” one (or more) of the franchise elements.

The 1-year limi&para;<br>tations period governing PMPA claims runs from the later&para;<br>of either (1) “the date of termination of the franchise” or&para;<br>(2) “the date the franchisor fails to comply with the re&para;<br>quirements of” the Act. §2805(a). Some violations of the&para;<br>PMPA, however, cannot occur until after a franchise has&para;<br>been terminated. See, e.g., §2802(d)(1) (franchisor must&para;<br>share with a franchisee certain parts of a condemnation&para;<br>award when the termination was the result of a condem&para;<br>nation or taking); §2802(d)(2) (franchisor must grant a&para;<br>franchisee a right of first refusal if the franchise was&para;<br>terminated due to the destruction of the service station&para;<br>and the station subsequently is rebuilt). The second ac&para;<br>crual date listed in §2805(a), therefore, shows only that&para;<br>the limitations period runs from the date of these types of&para;<br>post-termination violations.

For reasons similar to those&para;<br>given above, we agree with the Court of Appeals that a&para;<br>franchisee that chooses to accept a renewal agreement&para;<br>cannot thereafter assert a claim for unlawful nonrenewal&para;<br>under the Act.11&para;<br>The plain text of the statute leaves no room for a fran&para;<br>chisee to claim that a franchisor has unlawfully declined&para;<br>——————&para;<br>agreements and then signed new agreements that did not include the&para;<br>subsidy. See App. 161, 164, 316–321 (Mac’s Shell Service, Inc.); id., at&para;<br>138–139, 314–315 (Cynthia Karol); id., at 154–155, 310–311 (Akmal,&para;<br>Inc.); id., at 185–186, 268–269 (Sid Prashad); id., at 190, 312–313 (J &amp;&para;<br>M Avramidis, Inc.); id., at 179–182, 322–323 (RAM Corp., Inc.); id., at&para;<br>148–153, 324–325 (John A.

These dealers necessarily cannot&para;<br>establish that the elimination of the subsidy “terminate[d]” their&para;<br>franchises “prior to the conclusion of the term” stated in their franchise&para;<br>agreements. 15 U. S. C. §2802(a)(1). Whether they ceased operations&para;<br>after their franchise agreements expired, moreover, is irrelevant.&para;<br>Indeed, in the Court of Appeals, the dealers abandoned any claim for&para;<br>constructive termination based on the subsequent franchise agree&para;<br>ments.

But that dealer not&para;<br>only continued to operate for seven months after the subsidy ended, id.,&para;<br>at 204, but also during that period entered into an agreement with&para;<br>Motiva to extend the term of his franchise agreement, id., at 330–331.&para;<br>Moreover, that dealer had been planning to leave the service-station&para;<br>business before Motiva eliminated the subsidy, and he never claimed&para;<br>that his decision to leave had anything to do with Motiva’s rent policies.&para;<br>See id., at 202–207.&para;<br>11 As is true with respect to the dealers’ constructive termination&para;<br>claims, it is not necessary for us to decide in these cases whether the&para;<br>Act at all recognizes claims for “constructive nonrenewal.” We there&para;<br>fore do not express a view on that question.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>MAC’S SHELL SERVICE, INC. v. SHELL OIL &para;<br>&para;<br>PRODUCTS CO.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>to renew a franchise relationship—constructively or oth&para;<br>erwise—when the franchisee has in fact accepted a new&para;<br>franchise agreement. As relevant here, a franchisor vio&para;<br>lates the PMPA only when it “fail[s] to renew” a franchise&para;<br>relationship for a reason not provided for in the Act or&para;<br>after not providing the required notice. See 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2802. The Act defines the term “fail to renew,” in turn,&para;<br>as a “failure to reinstate, continue, or extend the franchise&para;<br>relationship.” §2801(14). Thus, the threshold require&para;<br>ment of any unlawful nonrenewal action—a requirement&para;<br>the franchisee bears the burden of establishing, see&para;<br>§2805(c)—is that the franchisor did not “reinstate, con&para;<br>tinue, or renew” the franchise relationship once a fran&para;<br>chise agreement expired. But if a franchisee signs a re&para;<br>newal agreement, the franchisor clearly has “reinstate[d],&para;<br>continue[d], or extend[ed]” the franchise relationship.&para;<br>True, the franchisee might find some of the terms in the&para;<br>new agreement objectionable. But the Act prohibits only&para;<br>unlawful “fail[ures] to renew” a franchise relationship, not&para;<br>renewals of a franchise relationship on terms that are less&para;<br>than favorable to the franchisee. A franchisee that signs a&para;<br>renewal agreement, in short, cannot carry the threshold&para;<br>burden of showing a “nonrenewal of the franchise rela&para;<br>tionship,” §2805(c), and thus necessarily cannot establish&para;<br>that the franchisor has violated the Act.&para;<br>The dealers point out that several of them signed their&para;<br>renewal agreements “under protest,” and they argue that&para;<br>they thereby explicitly preserved their ability to assert a&para;<br>claim for unlawful nonrenewal under the PMPA. That&para;<br>argument misunderstands the legal significance of signing&para;<br>a renewal agreement. Signing a renewal agreement does&para;<br>not constitute a waiver of a franchisee’s legal rights—&para;<br>something that signing “under protest” can sometimes&para;<br>help avoid. See, e.g., U. C.

See 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2805(a).&para;<br>The Act’s structure and purpose confirm this interpreta&para;<br>tion. By requiring franchisors to renew only the “franchise&para;<br>relationship,” as opposed to the same franchise agreement,&para;<br>see §2802; see also §2801(2), the PMPA contemplates that&para;<br>franchisors can respond to market demands by proposing&para;<br>new and different terms at the expiration of a franchise&para;<br>agreement. To that end, the Act authorizes franchisors to&para;<br>decline to renew a franchise relationship if the franchisee&para;<br>refuses to accept changes or additions that are proposed&para;<br>“in good faith and in the normal course of business” and&para;<br>that are not designed to convert the service station to&para;<br>direct operation by the franchisor. §2802(b)(3)(A). Addi&para;<br>tionally, the Act creates a procedural mechanism for re&para;<br>solving disputes over the legality of proposed new terms.&para;<br>If the parties cannot agree, the franchisor has the option&para;<br>of either modifying the objectionable terms or pursuing&para;<br>nonrenewal, in which case it must provide the franchisee&para;<br>with written notice well in advance of the date when the&para;<br>nonrenewal takes effect. §2804(a)(2). Once the franchisee&para;<br>receives notice of nonrenewal, it can seek a preliminary&para;<br>injunction under the Act’s relaxed injunctive standard,&para;<br>maintaining the status quo while a court determines the&para;<br>lawfulness of the proposed changes. See §2805(b)(2);&para;<br>supra, at 13.12&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 The&para;<br>&para;<br>availability of preliminary injunctive relief under the Act also&para;<br>explains why the dealers are wrong to suggest that our holding will&para;<br>force franchisees “to choose between accepting an unlawful and coercive&para;<br>contract in order to stay in business [or] rejecting it and going out of&para;<br>business in order to preserve a cause of action.” Respondents’ Brief 51&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted).

Instead, a&para;<br>franchisee could simply sign the new franchise agreement&para;<br>and decide later whether to sue under the PMPA. Fran&para;<br>chisees would then have the option of either continuing to&para;<br>operate under the new agreement or, if the terms of the&para;<br>agreement later proved unfavorable, bringing suit under&para;<br>the PMPA alleging that the newly imposed terms are&para;<br>unlawful. And because the PMPA has a 1-year statute of&para;<br>limitations, see §2805(a), franchisees would retain that&para;<br>option for the entire first year of a new franchise agree&para;<br>ment. Accepting the dealers’ argument, therefore, would&para;<br>cast a cloud of uncertainty over all renewal agreements&para;<br>and could chill franchisors from proposing new terms in&para;<br>response to changing market conditions and consumer&para;<br>needs.&para;<br>Finally, accepting the dealers’ argument would greatly&para;<br>expand the PMPA’s reach. Under the balance struck by&para;<br>the plain text of the statute, a franchisee faced with objec&para;<br>tionable new terms must decide whether challenging those&para;<br>terms is worth risking the nonrenewal of the franchise&para;<br>relationship; if the franchisee rejects the terms and the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>the Act once the franchisee receives notice of nonrenewal.
