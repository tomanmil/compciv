KAPPOS, UNDER SECRETARY OF &para;<br>&para;<br>COMMERCE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND &para;<br>&para;<br>DIRECTOR, PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–964.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued November 9, 2009—Decided June 28, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioners’ patent application seeks protection for a claimed invention&para;<br>that explains how commodities buyers and sellers in the energy mar&para;<br>ket can protect, or hedge, against the risk of price changes. The key&para;<br>claims are claim 1, which describes a series of steps instructing how&para;<br>to hedge risk, and claim 4, which places the claim 1 concept into a&para;<br>simple mathematical formula. The remaining claims explain how&para;<br>claims 1 and 4 can be applied to allow energy suppliers and consum&para;<br>ers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market de&para;<br>mand. The patent examiner rejected the application on the grounds&para;<br>that the invention is not implemented on a specific apparatus, merely&para;<br>manipulates an abstract idea, and solves a purely mathematical&para;<br>problem. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences agreed and&para;<br>affirmed. The Federal Circuit, in turn, affirmed. The en banc court&para;<br>rejected its prior test for determining whether a claimed invention&para;<br>was a patentable “process” under Patent Act, 35 U. S. C. §101—i.e.,&para;<br>whether the invention produced a “useful, concrete, and tangible re&para;<br>sult,” see, e.g., State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co v. Signature Financial&para;<br>Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373—holding instead that a claimed&para;<br>process is patent eligible if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or&para;<br>apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different&para;<br>state or thing. Concluding that this “machine-or-transformation test”&para;<br>is the sole test for determining patent eligibility of a “process” under&para;<br>§101, the court applied the test and held that the application was not&para;<br>patent eligible.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BILSKI v. KAPPOS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>545 F. 3d 943, affirmed.&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to&para;<br>Parts II–B–2 and II–C–2, concluding that petitioners’ claimed inven&para;<br>tion is not patent eligible. Pp. 4–8, 10–11, 12–16.&para;<br>(a) Section 101 specifies four independent categories of inventions&para;<br>or discoveries that are patent eligible: “process[es],” “machin[es],”&para;<br>“manufactur[es],” and “composition[s] of matter.” “In choosing such&para;<br>expansive terms, . . . Congress plainly contemplated that the patent&para;<br>laws would be given wide scope,” Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S.&para;<br>303, 308, in order to ensure that “ ‘ingenuity should receive a liberal&para;<br>encouragement,’ ” id., at 308–309. This Court’s precedents provide&para;<br>three specific exceptions to §101’s broad principles: “laws of nature,&para;<br>physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.” Id., at 309. While not re&para;<br>quired by the statutory text, these exceptions are consistent with the&para;<br>notion that a patentable process must be “new and useful.” And, in&para;<br>any case, the exceptions have defined the statute’s reach as a matter&para;<br>of statutory stare decisis going back 150 years. See Le Roy v.&para;<br>Tatham, 14 How. 156, 174. The §101 eligibility inquiry is only a&para;<br>threshold test. Even if a claimed invention qualifies in one of the&para;<br>four categories, it must also satisfy “the conditions and requirements&para;<br>of this title,” §101(a), including novelty, see §102, nonobviousness, see&para;<br>§103, and a full and particular description, see §112. The invention&para;<br>at issue is claimed to be a “process,” which §100(b) defines as a “proc&para;<br>ess, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, ma&para;<br>chine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.” Pp. 4–5.&para;<br>(b) The machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for pat&para;<br>ent eligibility under §101. The Court’s precedents establish that al&para;<br>though that test may be a useful and important clue or investigative&para;<br>tool, it is not the sole test for deciding whether an invention is a pat&para;<br>ent-eligible “process” under §101. In holding to the contrary, the&para;<br>Federal Circuit violated two principles of statutory interpretation:&para;<br>Courts “ ‘should not read into the patent laws limitations and condi&para;<br>tions which the legislature has not expressed,’ ” Diamond v. Diehr,&para;<br>450 U. S. 175, 182, and, “[u]nless otherwise defined, ‘words will be in&para;<br>terpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common mean&para;<br>ing,’ ” ibid. The Court is unaware of any ordinary, contemporary,&para;<br>common meaning of “process” that would require it to be tied to a&para;<br>machine or the transformation of an article. Respondent Patent Di&para;<br>rector urges the Court to read §101’s other three patentable catego&para;<br>ries as confining “process” to a machine or transformation. However,&para;<br>the doctrine of noscitur a sociis is inapplicable here, for §100(b) al&para;<br>ready explicitly defines “process,” see Burgess v. United States, 553&para;<br>U. S. 124, 130, and nothing about the section’s inclusion of those&para;<br>other categories suggests that a “process” must be tied to one of them.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Finally, the Federal Circuit incorrectly concluded that this Court has&para;<br>endorsed the machine-or-transformation test as the exclusive test.&para;<br>Recent authorities show that the test was never intended to be ex&para;<br>haustive or exclusive. See, e.g., Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 588,&para;<br>n. 9. Pp. 5–8.&para;<br>(c) Section 101 similarly precludes a reading of the term “process”&para;<br>that would categorically exclude business methods.&para;<br>The term&para;<br>“method” within §100(b)’s “process” definition, at least as a textual&para;<br>matter and before other consulting other Patent Act limitations and&para;<br>this Court’s precedents, may include at least some methods of doing&para;<br>business. The Court is unaware of any argument that the “ordinary,&para;<br>contemporary, common meaning,” Diehr, supra, at 182, of “method”&para;<br>excludes business methods. Nor is it clear what a business method&para;<br>exception would sweep in and whether it would exclude technologies&para;<br>for conducting a business more efficiently. The categorical exclusion&para;<br>argument is further undermined by the fact that federal law explic&para;<br>itly contemplates the existence of at least some business method pat&para;<br>ents: Under §273(b)(1), if a patent-holder claims infringement based&para;<br>on “a method in [a] patent,” the alleged infringer can assert a defense&para;<br>of prior use. By allowing this defense, the statute itself acknowledges&para;<br>that there may be business method patents. Section 273 thus clari&para;<br>fies the understanding that a business method is simply one kind of&para;<br>“method” that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible for patent&para;<br>ing under §101. A contrary conclusion would violate the canon&para;<br>against interpreting any statutory provision in a manner that would&para;<br>render another provision superfluous. See Corley v. United States,&para;<br>556 U. S. ___, ___. Finally, while §273 appears to leave open the pos&para;<br>sibility of some business method patents, it does not suggest broad&para;<br>patentability of such claimed inventions. Pp. 10–11.&para;<br>(d) Even though petitioners’ application is not categorically outside&para;<br>of §101 under the two atextual approaches the Court rejects today,&para;<br>that does not mean it is a “process” under §101. Petitioners seek to&para;<br>patent both the concept of hedging risk and the application of that&para;<br>concept to energy markets. Under Benson, Flook, and Diehr, how&para;<br>ever, these are not patentable processes but attempts to patent ab&para;<br>stract ideas. Claims 1 and 4 explain the basic concept of hedging and&para;<br>reduce that concept to a mathematical formula. This is an unpat&para;<br>entable abstract idea, just like the algorithms at issue in Benson and&para;<br>Flook. Petitioners’ remaining claims, broad examples of how hedging&para;<br>can be used in commodities and energy markets, attempt to patent&para;<br>the use of the abstract hedging idea, then instruct the use of well&para;<br>known random analysis techniques to help establish some of the in&para;<br>puts into the equation. They add even less to the underlying abstract&para;<br>principle than the invention held patent ineligible in Flook. Pp. 12–&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BILSKI v. KAPPOS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>15.&para;<br>(e) Because petitioners’ patent application can be rejected under&para;<br>the Court’s precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas, the&para;<br>Court need not define further what constitutes a patentable “proc&para;<br>ess,” beyond pointing to the definition of that term provided in&para;<br>§100(b) and looking to the guideposts in Benson, Flook, and Diehr.&para;<br>Nothing in today’s opinion should be read as endorsing the Federal&para;<br>Circuit’s past interpretations of §101. See, e.g., State Street, 49 F. 3d,&para;<br>at 1373. The appeals court may have thought it needed to make the&para;<br>machine-or-transformation test exclusive precisely because its case&para;<br>law had not adequately identified less extreme means of restricting&para;<br>business method patents. In disapproving an exclusive machine-or&para;<br>transformation test, this Court by no means desires to preclude the&para;<br>Federal Circuit’s development of other limiting criteria that further&para;<br>the Patent Act’s purposes and are not inconsistent with its text.&para;<br>P. 16.&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except for Parts II–&para;<br>B–2 and II–C–2.

The patent application claims a procedure for&para;<br>instructing buyers and sellers how to protect against the&para;<br>risk of price fluctuations in a discrete section of the econ&para;<br>omy. Three arguments are advanced for the proposition&para;<br>that the claimed invention is outside the scope of patent&para;<br>law: (1) it is not tied to a machine and does not transform&para;<br>an article; (2) it involves a method of conducting business;&para;<br>and (3) it is merely an abstract idea. The Court of Appeals&para;<br>ruled that the first mentioned of these, the so-called ma&para;<br>chine-or-transformation test, was the sole test to be used&para;<br>for determining the patentability of a “process” under the&para;<br>Patent Act, 35 U.

KAPPOS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>I&para;<br>Petitioners’ application seeks patent protection for a&para;<br>claimed invention that explains how buyers and sellers of&para;<br>commodities in the energy market can protect, or hedge,&para;<br>against the risk of price changes. The key claims are&para;<br>claims 1 and 4. Claim 1 describes a series of steps in&para;<br>structing how to hedge risk. Claim 4 puts the concept&para;<br>articulated in claim 1 into a simple mathematical formula.&para;<br>Claim 1 consists of the following steps:&para;<br>“(a) initiating a series of transactions between said&para;<br>commodity provider and consumers of said commodity&para;<br>wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at a&para;<br>fixed rate based upon historical averages, said fixed&para;<br>rate corresponding to a risk position of said consum&para;<br>ers;&para;<br>“(b) identifying market participants for said com&para;<br>modity having a counter-risk position to said consum&para;<br>ers; and&para;<br>“(c) initiating a series of transactions between said&para;<br>commodity provider and said market participants at a&para;<br>second fixed rate such that said series of market par&para;<br>ticipant transactions balances the risk position of said&para;<br>series of consumer transactions.” App. 19–20.&para;<br>The remaining claims explain how claims 1 and 4 can be&para;<br>applied to allow energy suppliers and consumers to mini&para;<br>mize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market de&para;<br>mand for energy. For example, claim 2 claims “[t]he&para;<br>method of claim 1 wherein said commodity is energy and&para;<br>said market participants are transmission distributors.”&para;<br>Id., at 20. Some of these claims also suggest familiar&para;<br>statistical approaches to determine the inputs to use in&para;<br>claim 4’s equation. For example, claim 7 advises using&para;<br>well-known random analysis techniques to determine how&para;<br>much a seller will gain “from each transaction under each&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

The Board of Patent Appeals and Interfer&para;<br>ences affirmed, concluding that the application involved&para;<br>only mental steps that do not transform physical matter&para;<br>and was directed to an abstract idea. Id., at 181a–186a.&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal&para;<br>Circuit heard the case en banc and affirmed. The case&para;<br>produced five different opinions. Students of patent law&para;<br>would be well advised to study these scholarly opinions.&para;<br>Chief Judge Michel wrote the opinion of the court. The&para;<br>court rejected its prior test for determining whether a&para;<br>claimed invention was a patentable “process” under&para;<br>§101—whether it produces a “ ‘useful, concrete, and tangi&para;<br>ble result’ ”—as articulated in State Street Bank &amp; Trust&para;<br>Co. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368,&para;<br>1373 (1998), and AT&amp;T Corp. v. Excel Communications,&para;<br>Inc., 172 F. 3d 1352, 1357 (1999). See In re Bilski, 545&para;<br>F. 3d 943, 959–960, and n. 19 (CA Fed. 2008) (en banc).&para;<br>The court held that “[a] claimed process is surely patent&para;<br>eligible under §101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine&para;<br>or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a&para;<br>different state or thing.” Id., at 954. The court concluded&para;<br>this “machine-or-transformation test” is “the sole test&para;<br>governing §101 analyses,” id., at 955, and thus the “test&para;<br>for determining patent eligibility of a process under §101,”&para;<br>id., at 956. Applying the machine-or-transformation test,&para;<br>the court held that petitioners’ application was not patent&para;<br>eligible. Id., at 963–966. Judge Dyk wrote a separate&para;<br>concurring opinion, providing historical support for the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BILSKI v. KAPPOS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>court’s approach. Id., at 966–976.&para;<br>Three judges wrote dissenting opinions. Judge Mayer&para;<br>argued that petitioners’ application was “not eligible for&para;<br>patent protection because it is directed to a method of&para;<br>conducting business.” Id., at 998. He urged the adoption&para;<br>of a “technological standard for patentability.” Id., at&para;<br>1010. Judge Rader would have found petitioners’ claims&para;<br>were an unpatentable abstract idea. Id., at 1011. Only&para;<br>Judge Newman disagreed with the court’s conclusion that&para;<br>petitioners’ application was outside of the reach of §101.&para;<br>She did not say that the application should have been&para;<br>granted but only that the issue should be remanded for&para;<br>further proceedings to determine whether the application&para;<br>qualified as patentable under other provisions. Id., at 997.&para;<br>This Court granted certiorari. 556 U. S. ___ (2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>A&para;<br>Section 101 defines the subject matter that may be&para;<br>patented under the Patent Act:&para;<br>“Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful&para;<br>process, machine, manufacture, or composition of&para;<br>matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof,&para;<br>may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions&para;<br>and requirements of this title.”&para;<br>Section 101 thus specifies four independent categories of&para;<br>inventions or discoveries that are eligible for protection:&para;<br>processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of&para;<br>matter. “In choosing such expansive terms . . . modified by&para;<br>the comprehensive ‘any,’ Congress plainly contemplated&para;<br>that the patent laws would be given wide scope.” Dia&para;<br>mond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 308 (1980). Congress&para;<br>took this permissive approach to patent eligibility to en&para;<br>sure that “ ‘ingenuity should receive a liberal encourage&para;<br>ment.’ ” Id., at 308–309 (quoting 5 Writings of Thomas&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Jefferson 75–76 (H. Washington ed. 1871)).&para;<br>The Court’s precedents provide three specific exceptions&para;<br>to §101’s broad patent-eligibility principles: “laws of na&para;<br>ture, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.” Chakra&para;<br>barty, supra, at 309. While these exceptions are not re&para;<br>quired by the statutory text, they are consistent with the&para;<br>notion that a patentable process must be “new and useful.”&para;<br>And, in any case, these exceptions have defined the reach&para;<br>of the statute as a matter of statutory stare decisis going&para;<br>back 150 years. See Le Roy v. Tatham, 14 How. 156, 174–&para;<br>175 (1853). The concepts covered by these exceptions are&para;<br>“part of the storehouse of knowledge of all men . . . free to&para;<br>all men and reserved exclusively to none.” Funk Brothers&para;<br>Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S. 127, 130 (1948).&para;<br>The §101 patent-eligibility inquiry is only a threshold&para;<br>test. Even if an invention qualifies as a process, machine,&para;<br>manufacture, or composition of matter, in order to receive&para;<br>the Patent Act’s protection the claimed invention must&para;<br>also satisfy “the conditions and requirements of this title.”&para;<br>§101. Those requirements include that the invention be&para;<br>novel, see §102, nonobvious, see §103, and fully and par&para;<br>ticularly described, see §112.&para;<br>The present case involves an invention that is claimed&para;<br>to be a “process” under §101. Section 100(b) defines “proc&para;<br>ess” as:&para;<br>“process, art or method, and includes a new use of a&para;<br>known process, machine, manufacture, composition of&para;<br>matter, or material.”&para;<br>The Court first considers two proposed categorical limita&para;<br>tions on “process” patents under §101 that would, if&para;<br>adopted, bar petitioners’ application in the present case:&para;<br>the machine-or-transformation test and the categorical&para;<br>exclusion of business method patents.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BILSKI v. KAPPOS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>1&para;<br>Under the Court of Appeals’ formulation, an invention is&para;<br>a “process” only if: “(1) it is tied to a particular machine or&para;<br>apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a&para;<br>different state or thing.” 545 F. 3d, at 954. This Court&para;<br>has “more than once cautioned that courts ‘should not read&para;<br>into the patent laws limitations and conditions which the&para;<br>legislature has not expressed.’ ” Diamond v. Diehr, 450&para;<br>U. S. 175, 182 (1981) (quoting Chakrabarty, supra, at 308;&para;<br>some internal quotation marks omitted). In patent law, as&para;<br>in all statutory construction, “[u]nless otherwise defined,&para;<br>‘words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, con&para;<br>temporary, common meaning.’ ” Diehr, supra, at 182&para;<br>(quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979)).&para;<br>The Court has read the §101 term “manufacture” in accor&para;<br>dance with dictionary definitions, see Chakrabarty, supra,&para;<br>at 308 (citing American Fruit Growers, Inc. v. Brogdex Co.,&para;<br>283 U. S. 1, 11 (1931)), and approved a construction of the&para;<br>term “composition of matter” consistent with common&para;<br>usage, see Chakrabarty, supra, at 308 (citing Shell Devel&para;<br>opment Co. v. Watson, 149 F. Supp. 279, 280 (DC 1957)).&para;<br>Any suggestion in this Court’s case law that the Patent&para;<br>Act’s terms deviate from their ordinary meaning has only&para;<br>been an explanation for the exceptions for laws of nature,&para;<br>physical phenomena, and abstract ideas. See Parker v.&para;<br>Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 588–589 (1978). This Court has not&para;<br>indicated that the existence of these well-established&para;<br>exceptions gives the Judiciary carte blanche to impose&para;<br>other limitations that are inconsistent with the text and&para;<br>the statute’s purpose and design. Concerns about at&para;<br>tempts to call any form of human activity a “process” can&para;<br>be met by making sure the claim meets the requirements&para;<br>of §101.&para;<br>Adopting the machine-or-transformation test as the sole&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>test for what constitutes a “process” (as opposed to just an&para;<br>important and useful clue) violates these statutory inter&para;<br>pretation principles. Section 100(b) provides that “[t]he&para;<br>term ‘process’ means process, art or method, and includes&para;<br>a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture,&para;<br>composition of matter, or material.” The Court is unaware&para;<br>of any “ ‘ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,’ ”&para;<br>Diehr, supra, at 182, of the definitional terms “process, art&para;<br>or method” that would require these terms to be tied to a&para;<br>machine or to transform an article. Respondent urges the&para;<br>Court to look to the other patentable categories in §101—&para;<br>machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter—to&para;<br>confine the meaning of “process” to a machine or trans&para;<br>formation, under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis. Under&para;<br>this canon, “an ambiguous term may be given more precise&para;<br>content by the neighboring words with which it is associ&para;<br>ated.” United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)&para;<br>(slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks omitted). This&para;<br>canon is inapplicable here, for §100(b) already explicitly&para;<br>defines the term “process.” See Burgess v. United States,&para;<br>553 U. S. 124, 130 (2008) (“When a statute includes an&para;<br>explicit definition, we must follow that definition” (inter&para;<br>nal quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals incorrectly concluded that this&para;<br>Court has endorsed the machine-or-transformation test as&para;<br>the exclusive test. It is true that Cochrane v. Deener, 94&para;<br>U. S. 780, 788 (1877), explained that a “process” is “an act,&para;<br>or a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to be&para;<br>transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.”&para;<br>More recent cases, however, have rejected the broad impli&para;<br>cations of this dictum; and, in all events, later authority&para;<br>shows that it was not intended to be an exhaustive or&para;<br>exclusive test.

The machine-or&para;<br>transformation test is not the sole test for deciding&para;<br>whether an invention is a patent-eligible “process.”&para;<br>2&para;<br>It is true that patents for inventions that did not satisfy&para;<br>the machine-or-transformation test were rarely granted in&para;<br>earlier eras, especially in the Industrial Age, as explained&para;<br>by Judge Dyk’s thoughtful historical review. See 545&para;<br>F. 3d, at 966–976 (concurring opinion). But times change.&para;<br>Technology and other innovations progress in unexpected&para;<br>ways.

See id.,&para;<br>at 192–193 (majority opinion) (holding a procedure for&para;<br>molding rubber that included a computer program is&para;<br>within patentable subject matter).

But there are reasons to&para;<br>doubt whether the test should be the sole criterion for&para;<br>determining the patentability of inventions in the Infor&para;<br>mation Age. As numerous amicus briefs argue, the ma&para;<br>chine-or-transformation test would create uncertainty as&para;<br>to the patentability of software, advanced diagnostic medi&para;<br>cine techniques, and inventions based on linear program&para;<br>ming, data compression, and the manipulation of digital&para;<br>signals. See, e.g., Brief for Business Software Alliance 24–&para;<br>25; Brief for Biotechnology Industry Organization et al.&para;<br>14–27; Brief for Boston Patent Law Association 8–15;&para;<br>Brief for Houston Intellectual Property Law Association&para;<br>17–22; Brief for Dolby Labs., Inc., et al. 9–10.&para;<br>In the course of applying the machine-or-transformation&para;<br>test to emerging technologies, courts may pose questions&para;<br>of such intricacy and refinement that they risk obscuring&para;<br>the larger object of securing patents for valuable inven&para;<br>tions without transgressing the public domain. The dis&para;<br>sent by Judge Rader refers to some of these difficulties.&para;<br>545 F. 3d, at 1015. As a result, in deciding whether previ&para;<br>ously unforeseen inventions qualify as patentable “proc&para;<br>ess[es],” it may not make sense to require courts to confine&para;<br>themselves to asking the questions posed by the machine&para;<br>or-transformation test. Section 101’s terms suggest that&para;<br>new technologies may call for new inquiries. See Benson,&para;<br>supra, at 71 (to “freeze process patents to old technologies,&para;<br>leaving no room for the revelations of the new, onrushing&para;<br>technology[,] . . . is not our purpose”).&para;<br>It is important to emphasize that the Court today is not&para;<br>commenting on the patentability of any particular inven&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BILSKI v. KAPPOS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tion, let alone holding that any of the above-mentioned&para;<br>technologies from the Information Age should or should&para;<br>not receive patent protection. This Age puts the possibil&para;<br>ity of innovation in the hands of more people and raises&para;<br>new difficulties for the patent law. With ever more people&para;<br>trying to innovate and thus seeking patent protections for&para;<br>their inventions, the patent law faces a great challenge in&para;<br>striking the balance between protecting inventors and not&para;<br>granting monopolies over procedures that others would&para;<br>discover by independent, creative application of general&para;<br>principles. Nothing in this opinion should be read to take&para;<br>a position on where that balance ought to be struck.&para;<br>C&para;<br>1&para;<br>Section 101 similarly precludes the broad contention&para;<br>that the term “process” categorically excludes business&para;<br>methods. The term “method,” which is within §100(b)’s&para;<br>definition of “process,” at least as a textual matter and&para;<br>before consulting other limitations in the Patent Act and&para;<br>this Court’s precedents, may include at least some meth&para;<br>ods of doing business. See, e.g., Webster’s New Interna&para;<br>tional Dictionary 1548 (2d ed. 1954) (defining “method” as&para;<br>“[a]n orderly procedure or process . . . regular way or&para;<br>manner of doing anything; hence, a set form of procedure&para;<br>adopted in investigation or instruction”). The Court is&para;<br>unaware of any argument that the “ ‘ordinary, contempo&para;<br>rary, common meaning,’ ” Diehr, supra, at 182, of “method”&para;<br>excludes business methods. Nor is it clear how far a pro&para;<br>hibition on business method patents would reach, and&para;<br>whether it would exclude technologies for conducting a&para;<br>business more efficiently. See, e.g., Hall, Business and&para;<br>Financial Method Patents, Innovation, and Policy, 56&para;<br>Scottish J. Pol. Econ. 443, 445 (2009) (“There is no precise&para;<br>definition of . . . business method patents”).&para;<br>The argument that business methods are categorically&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Under 35 U. S. C.&para;<br>§273(b)(1), if a patent-holder claims infringement based on&para;<br>“a method in [a] patent,” the alleged infringer can assert a&para;<br>defense of prior use. For purposes of this defense alone,&para;<br>“method” is defined as “a method of doing or conducting&para;<br>business.” §273(a)(3). In other words, by allowing this&para;<br>defense the statute itself acknowledges that there may be&para;<br>business method patents. Section 273’s definition of&para;<br>“method,” to be sure, cannot change the meaning of a&para;<br>prior-enacted statute. But what §273 does is clarify the&para;<br>understanding that a business method is simply one kind&para;<br>of “method” that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible&para;<br>for patenting under §101.&para;<br>A conclusion that business methods are not patentable&para;<br>in any circumstances would render §273 meaningless.&para;<br>This would violate the canon against interpreting any&para;<br>statutory provision in a manner that would render an&para;<br>other provision superfluous. See Corley v. United States,&para;<br>556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9). This principle, of&para;<br>course, applies to interpreting any two provisions in the&para;<br>U. S. Code, even when Congress enacted the provisions at&para;<br>different times. See, e.g., Hague v. Committee for Indus&para;<br>trial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 529–530 (1939) (opinion&para;<br>of Stone, J.). This established rule of statutory interpreta&para;<br>tion cannot be overcome by judicial speculation as to the&para;<br>subjective intent of various legislators in enacting the&para;<br>subsequent provision. Finally, while §273 appears to&para;<br>leave open the possibility of some business method pat&para;<br>ents, it does not suggest broad patentability of such&para;<br>claimed inventions.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Interpreting §101 to exclude all business methods sim&para;<br>ply because business method patents were rarely issued&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>BILSKI v.

See infra, at 12–15. Indeed, if the Court of&para;<br>Appeals were to succeed in defining a narrower category&para;<br>or class of patent applications that claim to instruct how&para;<br>business should be conducted, and then rule that the&para;<br>category is unpatentable because, for instance, it repre&para;<br>sents an attempt to patent abstract ideas, this conclusion&para;<br>might well be in accord with controlling precedent. See&para;<br>ibid. But beyond this or some other limitation consistent&para;<br>with the statutory text, the Patent Act leaves open the&para;<br>possibility that there are at least some processes that can&para;<br>be fairly described as business methods that are within&para;<br>patentable subject matter under §101.&para;<br>Finally, even if a particular business method fits into&para;<br>the statutory definition of a “process,” that does not mean&para;<br>that the application claiming that method should be&para;<br>granted.&para;<br>In order to receive patent protection, any&para;<br>claimed invention must be novel, §102, nonobvious, §103,&para;<br>and fully and particularly described, §112.

Rather than&para;<br>adopting categorical rules that might have wide-ranging&para;<br>and unforeseen impacts, the Court resolves this case&para;<br>narrowly on the basis of this Court’s decisions in Benson,&para;<br>Flook, and Diehr, which show that petitioners’ claims are&para;<br>not patentable processes because they are attempts to&para;<br>patent abstract ideas. Indeed, all members of the Court&para;<br>agree that the patent application at issue here falls out&para;<br>side of §101 because it claims an abstract idea.&para;<br>In Benson, the Court considered whether a patent appli&para;<br>cation for an algorithm to convert binary-coded decimal&para;<br>numerals into pure binary code was a “process” under&para;<br>§101. 409 U. S., at 64–67. The Court first explained that&para;<br>“ ‘[a] principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an&para;<br>original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no&para;<br>one can claim in either of them an exclusive right.’ ” Id., at&para;<br>67 (quoting Le Roy, 14 How., at 175). The Court then held&para;<br>the application at issue was not a “process,” but an unpat&para;<br>entable abstract idea. “It is conceded that one may not&para;<br>patent an idea. But in practical effect that would be the&para;<br>result if the formula for converting . . . numerals to pure&para;<br>binary numerals were patented in this case.” 409 U. S., at&para;<br>71. A contrary holding “would wholly pre-empt the&para;<br>mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a&para;<br>patent on the algorithm itself.” Id., at 72.&para;<br>In Flook, the Court considered the next logical step after&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BILSKI v. KAPPOS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Benson. The applicant there attempted to patent a proce&para;<br>dure for monitoring the conditions during the catalytic&para;<br>conversion process in the petrochemical and oil-refining&para;<br>industries. The application’s only innovation was reliance&para;<br>on a mathematical algorithm. 437 U. S., at 585–586.&para;<br>Flook held the invention was not a patentable “process.”&para;<br>The Court conceded the invention at issue, unlike the&para;<br>algorithm in Benson, had been limited so that it could still&para;<br>be freely used outside the petrochemical and oil-refining&para;<br>industries. 437 U. S., at 589–590. Nevertheless, Flook&para;<br>rejected “[t]he notion that post-solution activity, no matter&para;<br>how conventional or obvious in itself, can transform an&para;<br>unpatentable principle into a patentable process.” Id., at&para;<br>590. The Court concluded that the process at issue there&para;<br>was “unpatentable under §101, not because it contain[ed]&para;<br>a mathematical algorithm as one component, but because&para;<br>once that algorithm [wa]s assumed to be within the prior&para;<br>art, the application, considered as a whole, contain[ed] no&para;<br>patentable invention.” Id., at 594. As the Court later&para;<br>explained, Flook stands for the proposition that the prohi&para;<br>bition against patenting abstract ideas “cannot be circum&para;<br>vented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a&para;<br>particular technological environment” or adding “insignifi&para;<br>cant postsolution activity.” Diehr, 450 U. S., at 191–192.&para;<br>Finally, in Diehr, the Court established a limitation on&para;<br>the principles articulated in Benson and Flook. The appli&para;<br>cation in Diehr claimed a previously unknown method for&para;<br>“molding raw, uncured synthetic rubber into cured preci&para;<br>sion products,” using a mathematical formula to complete&para;<br>some of its several steps by way of a computer. 450 U. S.,&para;<br>at 177. Diehr explained that while an abstract idea, law of&para;<br>nature, or mathematical formula could not be patented,&para;<br>“an application of a law of nature or mathematical for&para;<br>mula to a known structure or process may well be deserv&para;<br>ing of patent protection.” Id., at 187. Diehr emphasized&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the need to consider the invention as a whole, rather than&para;<br>“dissect[ing] the claims into old and new elements and&para;<br>then . . . ignor[ing] the presence of the old elements in the&para;<br>analysis.” Id., at 188. Finally, the Court concluded that&para;<br>because the claim was not “an attempt to patent a&para;<br>mathematical formula, but rather [was] an industrial&para;<br>process for the molding of rubber products,” it fell within&para;<br>§101’s patentable subject matter. Id., at 192–193.&para;<br>In light of these precedents, it is clear that petitioners’&para;<br>application is not a patentable “process.” Claims 1 and 4&para;<br>in petitioners’ application explain the basic concept of&para;<br>hedging, or protecting against risk: “Hedging is a funda&para;<br>mental economic practice long prevalent in our system of&para;<br>commerce and taught in any introductory finance class.”&para;<br>545 F. 3d, at 1013 (Rader, J., dissenting); see, e.g., D.&para;<br>Chorafas, Introduction to Derivative Financial Instru&para;<br>ments 75–94 (2008); C. Stickney, R. Weil, K. Schipper, &amp;&para;<br>J. Francis, Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Con&para;<br>cepts, Methods, and Uses 581–582 (13th ed. 2010); S.&para;<br>Ross, R. Westerfield, &amp; B. Jordan, Fundamentals of Cor&para;<br>porate Finance 743–744 (8th ed. 2008). The concept of&para;<br>hedging, described in claim 1 and reduced to a mathemati&para;<br>cal formula in claim 4, is an unpatentable abstract idea,&para;<br>just like the algorithms at issue in Benson and Flook.&para;<br>Allowing petitioners to patent risk hedging would pre&para;<br>empt use of this approach in all fields, and would effec&para;<br>tively grant a monopoly over an abstract idea.&para;<br>Petitioners’ remaining claims are broad examples of how&para;<br>hedging can be used in commodities and energy markets.&para;<br>Flook established that limiting an abstract idea to one&para;<br>field of use or adding token postsolution components did&para;<br>not make the concept patentable. That is exactly what the&para;<br>remaining claims in petitioners’ application do. These&para;<br>claims attempt to patent the use of the abstract idea of&para;<br>hedging risk in the energy market and then instruct the&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>BILSKI v. KAPPOS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>use of well-known random analysis techniques to help&para;<br>establish some of the inputs into the equation. Indeed,&para;<br>these claims add even less to the underlying abstract&para;<br>principle than the invention in Flook did, for the Flook&para;<br>invention was at least directed to the narrower domain of&para;<br>signaling dangers in operating a catalytic converter.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Today, the Court once again declines to impose limita&para;<br>tions on the Patent Act that are inconsistent with the Act’s&para;<br>text. The patent application here can be rejected under&para;<br>our precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas.&para;<br>The Court, therefore, need not define further what consti&para;<br>tutes a patentable “process,” beyond pointing to the defini&para;<br>tion of that term provided in §100(b) and looking to the&para;<br>guideposts in Benson, Flook, and Diehr.&para;<br>And nothing in today’s opinion should be read as endors&para;<br>ing interpretations of §101 that the Court of Appeals for&para;<br>the Federal Circuit has used in the past. See, e.g., State&para;<br>Street, 149 F. 3d, at 1373; AT&amp;T Corp., 172 F. 3d, at 1357.&para;<br>It may be that the Court of Appeals thought it needed to&para;<br>make the machine-or-transformation test exclusive pre&para;<br>cisely because its case law had not adequately identified&para;<br>less extreme means of restricting business method pat&para;<br>ents, including (but not limited to) application of our&para;<br>opinions in Benson, Flook, and Diehr.

But I would take a different approach.&para;<br>Rather than making any broad statements about how to&para;<br>define the term “process” in §101 or tinkering with the&para;<br>bounds of the category of unpatentable, abstract ideas, I&para;<br>would restore patent law to its historical and constitu&para;<br>tional moorings.&para;<br>For centuries, it was considered well established that a&para;<br>series of steps for conducting business was not, in itself,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BILSKI v.

Following several more years of confusion, the&para;<br>Federal Circuit changed course, overruling recent deci&para;<br>sions and holding that a series of steps may constitute a&para;<br>patentable process only if it is tied to a machine or trans&para;<br>forms an article into a different state or thing. This “ma&para;<br>chine-or-transformation test” excluded general methods of&para;<br>doing business as well as, potentially, a variety of other&para;<br>subjects that could be called processes.&para;<br>The Court correctly holds that the machine-or&para;<br>transformation test is not the sole test for what constitutes&para;<br>a patentable process; rather, it is a critical clue.1 But the&para;<br>Court is quite wrong, in my view, to suggest that any&para;<br>series of steps that is not itself an abstract idea or law of&para;<br>nature may constitute a “process” within the meaning of&para;<br>§101. The language in the Court’s opinion to this effect&para;<br>can only cause mischief.

In re Bilski,&para;<br>545 F. 3d 943, 959–960 (2008). Relying on several of our&para;<br>cases in which we explained how to differentiate a claim&para;<br>on a “fundamental principle” from a claim on a “process,”&para;<br>the court concluded that a “claimed process is surely pat&para;<br>ent-eligible under §101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular&para;<br>machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular&para;<br>article into a different state or thing.” Id., at 954–955.&para;<br>The court further concluded that this “machine-or&para;<br>transformation test” is “the sole test governing §101&para;<br>analyses,” id., at 955 (emphasis added), and therefore the&para;<br>“test for determining patent eligibility of a process under&para;<br>§101,” id., at 956.

The&para;<br>opinion is less than pellucid in more than one respect, and,&para;<br>if misunderstood, could result in confusion or upset settled&para;<br>areas of the law. Three preliminary observations may be&para;<br>clarifying.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>First, the Court suggests that the terms in the Patent&para;<br>Act must be read as lay speakers use those terms, and not&para;<br>as they have traditionally been understood in the context&para;<br>of patent law. See, e.g., ante, at 6 (terms in §101 must be&para;<br>viewed in light of their “ ‘ordinary, contemporary, common&para;<br>meaning’ ”); ante, at 10 (patentable “method” is any “or&para;<br>derly procedure or process,” “regular way or manner of&para;<br>doing anything,” or “set form of procedure adopted in&para;<br>investigation or instruction” (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted)). As I will explain at more length in Part III,&para;<br>infra, if this portion of the Court’s opinion were taken&para;<br>literally, the results would be absurd: Anything that con&para;<br>stitutes a series of steps would be patentable so long as it&para;<br>is novel, nonobvious, and described with specificity. But&para;<br>the opinion cannot be taken literally on this point. The&para;<br>Court makes this clear when it accepts that the “atextual”&para;<br>machine-or-transformation test, ante, at 12, is “useful and&para;<br>important,” ante, at 8, even though it “violates” the stated&para;<br>“statutory interpretation principles,” ante, at 6; and when&para;<br>the Court excludes processes that tend to pre-empt com&para;<br>monly used ideas, see ante, at 14–15.&para;<br>Second, in the process of addressing the sole issue&para;<br>presented to us, the opinion uses some language that&para;<br>seems inconsistent with our centuries-old reliance on the&para;<br>machine-or-transformation criteria as clues to patentabil&para;<br>ity. Most notably, the opinion for a plurality suggests&para;<br>that these criteria may operate differently when address&para;<br>ing technologies of a recent vintage. See ante, at 8–9&para;<br>(machine-or-transformation test is useful “for evaluating&para;<br>processes similar to those in the Industrial Age,” but is&para;<br>less useful “for determining the patentability of inventions&para;<br>in the Information Age”). In moments of caution, however,&para;<br>the opinion for the Court explains—correctly—that the&para;<br>Court is merely restoring the law to its historical state of&para;<br>rest. See ante, at 8 (“This Court’s precedents establish&para;<br>that the machine-or-transformation test is a useful and&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BILSKI v. KAPPOS&para;<br>STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>important clue, an investigative tool, for determining&para;<br>whether some claimed inventions are processes under&para;<br>§101 ”). Notwithstanding this internal tension, I under&para;<br>stand the Court’s opinion to hold only that the machine-or&para;<br>transformation test remains an important test for pat&para;<br>entability. Few, if any, processes cannot effectively be&para;<br>evaluated using these criteria.&para;<br>Third, in its discussion of an issue not contained in the&para;<br>questions presented—whether the particular series of&para;<br>steps in petitioners’ application is an abstract idea—the&para;<br>Court uses language that could suggest a shift in our&para;<br>approach to that issue. Although I happen to agree that&para;<br>petitioners seek to patent an abstract idea, the Court does&para;<br>not show how this conclusion follows “clear[ly],” ante, at&para;<br>15, from our case law. The patent now before us is not for&para;<br>“[a] principle, in the abstract,” or a “fundamental truth.”&para;<br>Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584, 589 (1978) (internal quota&para;<br>tion marks omitted). Nor does it claim the sort of phe&para;<br>nomenon of nature or abstract idea that was embodied by&para;<br>the mathematical formula at issue in Gottschalk v. Ben&para;<br>son, 409 U. S. 63, 67 (1972), and in Flook.&para;<br>The Court construes petitioners’ claims on processes for&para;<br>pricing as claims on “the basic concept of hedging, or&para;<br>protecting against risk,” ante, at 14, and thus discounts&para;<br>the application’s discussion of what sorts of data to use,&para;<br>and how to analyze those data, as mere “token postsolu&para;<br>tion components,” ante, at 15. In other words, the Court&para;<br>artificially limits petitioners’ claims to hedging, and then&para;<br>concludes that hedging is an abstract idea rather than a&para;<br>term that describes a category of processes including&para;<br>petitioners’ claims. Why the Court does this is never&para;<br>made clear. One might think that the Court’s analysis&para;<br>means that any process that utilizes an abstract idea is&para;<br>itself an unpatentable, abstract idea. But we have never&para;<br>suggested any such rule, which would undermine a host of&para;<br>patentable processes. It is true, as the Court observes,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>that petitioners’ application is phrased broadly. See ante,&para;<br>at 14–15. But claim specification is covered by §112, not&para;<br>§101; and if a series of steps constituted an unpatentable&para;<br>idea merely because it was described without sufficient&para;<br>specificity, the Court could be calling into question some of&para;<br>our own prior decisions.2 At points, the opinion suggests&para;<br>that novelty is the clue. See ante, at 14. But the fact that&para;<br>hedging is “ ‘long prevalent in our system of commerce,’ ”&para;<br>ibid., cannot justify the Court’s conclusion, as “the proper&para;<br>construction of §101 . . . does not involve the familiar&para;<br>issu[e] of novelty” that arises under §102. Flook, 437&para;<br>U. S., at 588. At other points, the opinion for a plurality&para;<br>suggests that the analysis turns on the category of patent&para;<br>involved. See, e.g., ante, at 12 (courts should use the&para;<br>abstract-idea rule as a “too[l]” to set “a high enough bar”&para;<br>“when considering patent applications of this sort”). But&para;<br>we have never in the past suggested that the inquiry&para;<br>varies by subject matter.&para;<br>The Court, in sum, never provides a satisfying account&para;<br>of what constitutes an unpatentable abstract idea. In&para;<br>deed, the Court does not even explain if it is using the&para;<br>machine-or-transformation criteria. The Court essentially&para;<br>asserts its conclusion that petitioners’ application claims&para;<br>an abstract idea. This mode of analysis (or lack thereof)&para;<br>may have led to the correct outcome in this case, but it&para;<br>also means that the Court’s musings on this issue stand&para;<br>for very little.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 For&para;<br>&para;<br>example, a rule that broadly-phrased claims cannot constitute&para;<br>patentable processes could call into question our approval of Alexander&para;<br>Graham Bell’s famous fifth claim on “ ‘[t]he method of, and apparatus&para;<br>for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically, as herein&para;<br>described, by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the&para;<br>vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds,&para;<br>substantially as set forth,’ ” The Telephone Cases, 126 U.

KAPPOS&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>I agree with the Court that the text of §101 must be the&para;<br>starting point of our analysis. As I shall explain, however,&para;<br>the text must not be the end point as well.&para;<br>Pursuant to its power “[t]o promote the Progress of . . .&para;<br>useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to . . . Inventors&para;<br>the exclusive Right to their . . . Discoveries,” U. S. Const.,&para;<br>Art. I, §8, cl. 8, Congress has passed a series of patent&para;<br>laws that grant certain exclusive rights over certain in&para;<br>ventions and discoveries as a means of encouraging inno&para;<br>vation. In the latest iteration, the Patent Act of 1952&para;<br>(1952 Act), Congress has provided that “[w]hoever invents&para;<br>or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manu&para;<br>facture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful&para;<br>improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, sub&para;<br>ject to the conditions and requirements of this title,” 35&para;<br>U. S. C. §101, which include that the patent also be novel,&para;<br>§102, and nonobvious, §103. The statute thus authorizes&para;<br>four categories of subject matter that may be patented:&para;<br>processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of&para;<br>matter. Section 101 imposes a threshold condition. “[N]o&para;<br>patent is available for a discovery, however useful, novel,&para;<br>and nonobvious, unless it falls within one of the express&para;<br>categories of patentable subject matter.” Kewanee Oil Co.&para;<br>v. Bicron Corp., 416 U. S. 470, 483 (1974).&para;<br>Section 101 undoubtedly defines in “expansive terms”&para;<br>the subject matter eligible for patent protection, as the&para;<br>statute was meant to ensure that “ ‘ingenuit[ies] receive a&para;<br>liberal encouragement.’ ” Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447&para;<br>U. S. 303, 308–309 (1980); see also J. E. M. Ag Supply,&para;<br>Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int’l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, 130&para;<br>(2001). Nonetheless, not every new invention or discovery&para;<br>may be patented. Certain things are “free for all to use.”&para;<br>Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.

S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>141, 151 (1989).3&para;<br>The text of the Patent Act does not on its face give much&para;<br>guidance about what constitutes a patentable process.&para;<br>The statute defines the term “process” as a “process, art or&para;<br>method [that] includes a new use of a known process,&para;<br>machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or mate&para;<br>rial.” §100(b). But, this definition is not especially help&para;<br>ful, given that it also uses the term “process” and is there&para;<br>fore somewhat circular.&para;<br>As lay speakers use the word “process,” it constitutes&para;<br>any series of steps. But it has always been clear that, as&para;<br>used in §101, the term does not refer to a “ ‘process’ in the&para;<br>ordinary sense of the word,” Flook, 437 U. S., at 588; see&para;<br>also Corning v. Burden, 15 How. 252, 268 (1854) (“[T]he&para;<br>term process is often used in a more vague sense, in which&para;<br>it cannot be the subject of a patent”). Rather, as discussed&para;<br>in some detail in Part IV, infra, the term “process” (along&para;<br>with the definitions given to that term) has long accumu&para;<br>lated a distinctive meaning in patent law. When the term&para;<br>was used in the 1952 Patent Act, it was neither intended&para;<br>nor understood to encompass any series of steps or any&para;<br>way to do any thing.&para;<br>With that understanding in mind, the Government has&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>Court quotes our decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S.&para;<br>303 (1980), for the proposition that, “ ‘[i]n choosing such expansive&para;<br>terms . . . modified by the comprehensive “any,” Congress plainly&para;<br>contemplated that the patent laws would be given wide scope.’ ” Ante,&para;<br>at 4. But the Court fails to mention which terms we were discussing in&para;<br>Chakrabarty: the terms “manufacture” and “composition of matter.”&para;<br>See 447 U. S., at 308 (“In choosing such expansive terms as ‘manufac&para;<br>ture’ and ‘composition of matter,’ modified by the comprehensive ‘any,’&para;<br>Congress plainly contemplated that the patent laws would be given&para;<br>wide scope”). As discussed herein, Congress’ choice of the term “proc&para;<br>ess” reflected a background understanding of what sorts of series of&para;<br>steps could be patented, and likely reflected an intentional design to&para;<br>codify that settled, judicial understanding. This may not have been the&para;<br>case with the terms at issue in Chakrabarty.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>BILSKI v. KAPPOS&para;<br>STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>argued that because “a word” in a statute “is given more&para;<br>precise content by the neighboring words with which it”&para;<br>associates, United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 294&para;<br>(2008), we may draw inferences from the fact that “[t]he&para;<br>other three statutory categories of patent-eligible subject&para;<br>matter identified in Section 101—‘machine, manufacture,&para;<br>or composition of matter’—all ‘are things made by man,&para;<br>and involve technology.’ ” Brief for Respondent 26. Spe&para;<br>cifically, the Government submits, we may infer “that the&para;<br>term ‘process’ is limited to technological and industrial&para;<br>methods.” Ibid. The Court rejects this submission cate&para;<br>gorically, on the ground that “§100(b) already explicitly&para;<br>defines the term ‘process.’ ” Ante, at 6. But §100(b) de&para;<br>fines the term “process” by using the term “process,” as&para;<br>well as several other general terms. This is not a case,&para;<br>then, in which we must either “follow” a definition, ante, at&para;<br>7, or rely on neighboring words to understand the scope of&para;<br>an ambiguous term. The definition itself contains the very&para;<br>ambiguous term that we must define.&para;<br>In my view, the answer lies in between the Govern&para;<br>ment’s and the Court’s positions: The terms adjacent to&para;<br>“process” in §101 provide a clue as to its meaning, al&para;<br>though not a very strong clue. Section 101’s list of catego&para;<br>ries of patentable subject matter is phrased in the disjunc&para;<br>tive, suggesting that the term “process” has content&para;<br>distinct from the other items in the list. It would therefore&para;<br>be illogical to “rob” the word “process” of all independent&para;<br>meaning. Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 338&para;<br>(1979). Moreover, to the extent we can draw inferences&para;<br>about what is a “process” from common attributes in §101,&para;<br>it is a dangerous endeavor to do so on the basis of a per&para;<br>ceived overarching theme. Given the many moving parts&para;<br>at work in the Patent Act, there is a risk of merely con&para;<br>firming our preconceived notions of what should be pat&para;<br>entable or of seeing common attributes that track “the&para;<br>familiar issues of novelty and obviousness” that arise&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>under other sections of the statute but are not relevant to&para;<br>§101, Flook, 437 U. S., at 588. The placement of “process”&para;<br>next to other items thus cannot prove that the term is&para;<br>limited to any particular categories; it does, however, give&para;<br>reason to be skeptical that the scope of a patentable “proc&para;<br>ess” extends to cover any series of steps at all.&para;<br>The Court makes a more serious interpretive error. As&para;<br>briefly discussed in Part II, supra, the Court at points&para;<br>appears to reject the well-settled proposition that the term&para;<br>“process” in §101 is not a “ ‘process’ in the ordinary sense&para;<br>of the word,” Flook, 437 U. S., at 588. Instead, the Court&para;<br>posits that the word “process” must be understood in light&para;<br>of its “ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,” ante, at&para;<br>6 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although this is a&para;<br>fine approach to statutory interpretation in general, it is a&para;<br>deeply flawed approach to a statute that relies on complex&para;<br>terms of art developed against a particular historical&para;<br>background.4 Indeed, the approach would render §101&para;<br>almost comical. A process for training a dog, a series of&para;<br>dance steps, a method of shooting a basketball, maybe&para;<br>even words, stories, or songs if framed as the steps of&para;<br>typing letters or uttering sounds—all would be patent&para;<br>eligible. I am confident that the term “process” in §101 is&para;<br>not nearly so capacious.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 For example, if this Court were to interpret the Sherman Act accord&para;<br>ing to the Act’s plain text, it could prohibit “the entire body of private&para;<br>contract,” National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435&para;<br>U. S. 679, 688 (1978).&para;<br>5 The Court attempts to avoid such absurd results by stating that&para;<br>these “[c]oncerns” “can be met by making sure that the claim meets the&para;<br>requirements of §101.” Ante, at 6. Because the only limitation on the&para;<br>plain meaning of “process” that the Court acknowledges explicitly is the&para;<br>bar on abstract ideas, laws of nature, and the like, it is presumably this&para;<br>limitation that is left to stand between all conceivable human activity&para;<br>and patent monopolies. But many processes that would make for&para;<br>absurd patents are not abstract ideas. Nor can the requirements of&para;<br>novelty, nonobviousness, and particular description pick up the slack.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BILSKI v. KAPPOS&para;<br>STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>So is the Court, perhaps. What is particularly incredi&para;<br>ble about the Court’s stated method of interpreting §101&para;<br>(other than that the method itself may be patent-eligible&para;<br>under the Court’s theory of §101) is that the Court devi&para;<br>ates from its own professed commitment to “ordinary,&para;<br>contemporary, common meaning.” As noted earlier, the&para;<br>Court accepts a role for the “atextual” machine-or&para;<br>transformation “clue.” Ante, at 12, 7. The Court also&para;<br>accepts that we have “foreclose[d] a purely literal reading&para;<br>of §101,” Flook, 437 U. S., at 589, by holding that claims&para;<br>that are close to “laws of nature, natural phenomena, and&para;<br>abstract ideas,” Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185&para;<br>(1981), do not count as “processes” under §101, even if&para;<br>they can be colloquially described as such.6 The Court&para;<br>attempts to justify this latter exception to §101 as “a&para;<br>matter of statutory stare decisis.” Ante, at 5. But it is&para;<br>strange to think that the very same term must be inter&para;<br>preted literally on some occasions, and in light of its his&para;<br>torical usage on others.&para;<br>In fact, the Court’s understanding of §101 is even more&para;<br>remarkable because its willingness to exclude general&para;<br>principles from the provision’s reach is in tension with its&para;<br>apparent willingness to include steps for conducting busi&para;<br>ness. The history of patent law contains strong norms&para;<br>against patenting these two categories of subject matter.&para;<br>Both norms were presumably incorporated by Congress&para;<br>into the Patent Act in 1952.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Cf. ante, at 12–13 (plurality opinion).

But it is nonetheless significant that while people&para;<br>have long innovated in fields of business, methods of doing&para;<br>business fall outside of the subject matter that has “his&para;<br>torically been eligible to receive the protection of our&para;<br>patent laws,” Diehr, 450 U.

It is also significant that when&para;<br>Congress enacted the latest Patent Act, it did so against&para;<br>the background of a well-settled understanding that a&para;<br>series of steps for conducting business cannot be patented.&para;<br>These considerations ought to guide our analysis.

Indeed, if that were so, then&para;<br>our many opinions analyzing what is a patentable process&para;<br>were simply wastes of pages in the U. S. Reports. And to&para;<br>accept that errant piece of legislative history as widening&para;<br>the scope of the patent law would contradict other evi&para;<br>dence in the congressional record, as well as our presump&para;<br>tion that the 1952 Act merely codified the meaning of&para;<br>“process” and did not expand it, see Diehr, 450 U.

The full sentence&para;<br>in the Committee Reports reads: “A person may have&para;<br>‘invented’ a machine or a manufacture, which may include&para;<br>anything under the sun that is made by man, but it is not&para;<br>necessarily patentable under section 101 unless the condi&para;<br>tions of [this] title are fulfilled.” S.

Indeed, the language may&para;<br>be understood to state the exact opposite: that “[a] person&para;<br>may have ‘invented’ . . . anything under the sun,” but that&para;<br>thing “is not necessarily patentable under section 101.”&para;<br>Thus, even in the Chakrabarty opinion, which relied on&para;<br>this quote, we cautioned that the 1952 Reports did not&para;<br>“suggest that §101 has no limits or that it embraces every&para;<br>discovery.” 447 U. S., at 309.&para;<br>Moreover, even if the language in the Committee Re&para;<br>ports was meant to flesh out the meaning of any portion of&para;<br>§101, it did not purport to define the term “process.” The&para;<br>language refers only to “manufacture[s]” and “machine[s],”&para;<br>tangible objects “made by man.” It does not reference the&para;<br>“process” category of subject matter (nor could a process be&para;<br>comfortably described as something “made by man”). The&para;<br>language may also be understood merely as defining the&para;<br>term “invents” in §101. As Judge Dyk explained in his&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

Although it may be difficult to define with&para;<br>precision what is a patentable “process” under §101, the&para;<br>historical clues converge on one conclusion: A business&para;<br>method is not a “process.” And to the extent that there is&para;<br>ambiguity, we should be mindful of our judicial role. “[W]e&para;<br>&para;<br>34&para;<br>&para;<br>BILSKI v.

This argument utilizes a flawed method of&para;<br>statutory interpretation and ignores the motivation for the&para;<br>1999 Act.&para;<br>In 1999, following a Federal Circuit decision that inti&para;<br>mated business methods could be patented, see State&para;<br>Street, 149 F. 3d 1368, Congress moved quickly to limit&para;<br>the potential fallout. Congress passed the 1999 Act, codi&para;<br>fied at 35 U. S. C. §273, which provides a limited defense&para;<br>to claims of patent infringement, see §273(b), regarding&para;<br>certain “method[s] of doing or conducting business,”&para;<br>§273(a)(3).&para;<br>It is apparent, both from the content and history of the&para;<br>Act, that Congress did not in any way ratify State Street&para;<br>(or, as petitioners contend, the broadest possible reading&para;<br>of State Street). The Act merely limited one potential&para;<br>effect of that decision: that businesses might suddenly find&para;<br>themselves liable for innocently using methods they as&para;<br>sumed could not be patented. The Act did not purport to&para;<br>amend the limitations in §101 on eligible subject matter.&para;<br>Indeed, Congress placed the statute in Part III of Title 35,&para;<br>which addresses “Patents and Protection of Patent&para;<br>Rights,” rather than in Part II, which contains §101 and&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U.

S. 457, 468&para;<br>(2001).&para;<br>The Act therefore is, at best, merely evidence of 1999&para;<br>legislative views on the meaning of the earlier, 1952 Act.&para;<br>“[T]he views of a subsequent Congress,” however, “form a&para;<br>hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.”&para;<br>United States v. Price, 361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960). When a&para;<br>later statute is offered as “an expression of how the . . .&para;<br>Congress interpreted a statute passed by another Con&para;<br>gress . . . a half century before,” “such interpretation has&para;<br>very little, if any, significance.” Rainwater v. United&para;<br>States, 356 U. S. 590, 593 (1958).&para;<br>Furthermore, even assuming that Congress’ views at&para;<br>the turn of the 21st century could potentially serve as a&para;<br>valid basis for interpreting a statute passed in the mid&para;<br>20th century, the First Inventor Defense Act does not aid&para;<br>petitioners because it does not show that the later Con&para;<br>gress itself understood §101 to cover business methods. If&para;<br>anything, it shows that a few judges on the Federal Cir&para;<br>cuit understood §101 in that manner and that Congress&para;<br>understood what those judges had done. The Act appears&para;<br>to reflect surprise and perhaps even dismay that business&para;<br>methods might be patented. Thus, in the months follow&para;<br>ing State Street, congressional authorities lamented that&para;<br>“business methods and processes . . . until recently were&para;<br>thought not to be patentable,” H.

KAPPOS&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>with both the opinion of the Court and JUSTICE STEVENS’&para;<br>opinion concurring in the judgment:&para;<br>First, although the text of §101 is broad, it is not with&para;<br>out limit. See ante, at 4–5 (opinion of the Court); ante, at&para;<br>10 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). “[T]he underly&para;<br>ing policy of the patent system [is] that ‘the things which&para;<br>are worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive&para;<br>patent,’ . . . must outweigh the restrictive effect of the&para;<br>limited patent monopoly.” Graham v. John Deere Co. of&para;<br>Kansas City, 383 U. S. 1, 10–11 (1966) (quoting Letter&para;<br>from Thomas Jefferson to Isaac McPherson (Aug. 13,&para;<br>1813), in 6 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 181 (H. Washing&para;<br>ton ed.)). The Court has thus been careful in interpreting&para;<br>the Patent Act to “determine not only what is protected,&para;<br>but also what is free for all to use.” Bonito Boats, Inc. v.&para;<br>Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 151 (1989). In&para;<br>particular, the Court has long held that “[p]henomena of&para;<br>nature, though just discovered, mental processes, and&para;<br>abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable” under&para;<br>§101, since allowing individuals to patent these funda&para;<br>mental principles would “wholly pre-empt” the public’s&para;<br>access to the “basic tools of scientific and technological&para;<br>work.” Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U. S. 63, 67, 72 (1972);&para;<br>see also, e.g., Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U. S. 175, 185 (1981);&para;<br>Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 309 (1980).&para;<br>Second, in a series of cases that extend back over a&para;<br>century, the Court has stated that “[t]ransformation and&para;<br>reduction of an article to a different state or thing is the&para;<br>clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not&para;<br>include particular machines.” Diehr, supra, at 184 (em&para;<br>phasis added; internal quotation marks omitted); see also,&para;<br>e.g., Benson, supra, at 70; Parker v. Flook, 437 U. S. 584,&para;<br>588, n. 9 (1978); Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U. S. 780, 788&para;<br>(1877). Application of this test, the so-called “machine-or&para;<br>transformation test,” has thus repeatedly helped the Court&para;<br>to determine what is “a patentable ‘process.’ ” Flook, supra,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>at 589.&para;<br>Third, while the machine-or-transformation test has&para;<br>always been a “useful and important clue,” it has never&para;<br>been the “sole test” for determining patentability. Ante, at&para;<br>8; see also ante, at 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg&para;<br>ment); Benson, supra, at 71 (rejecting the argument that&para;<br>“no process patent could ever qualify” for protection under&para;<br>§101 “if it did not meet the [machine-or-transformation]&para;<br>requirements”). Rather, the Court has emphasized that a&para;<br>process claim meets the requirements of §101 when, “con&para;<br>sidered as a whole,” it “is performing a function which the&para;<br>patent laws were designed to protect (e.g., transforming or&para;<br>reducing an article to a different state or thing).” Diehr,&para;<br>supra, at 192. The machine-or-transformation test is thus&para;<br>an important example of how a court can determine pat&para;<br>entability under §101, but the Federal Circuit erred in this&para;<br>case by treating it as the exclusive test.&para;<br>Fourth, although the machine-or-transformation test is&para;<br>not the only test for patentability, this by no means indi&para;<br>cates that anything which produces a “ ‘useful, concrete,&para;<br>and tangible result,’ ” State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.&para;<br>Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F. 3d 1368, 1373 (CA&para;<br>Fed. 1998), is patentable. “[T]his Court has never made&para;<br>such a statement and, if taken literally, the statement&para;<br>would cover instances where this Court has held the con&para;<br>trary.” Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings v. Metabo&para;<br>lite Laboratories, Inc., 548 U. S. 124, 136 (2006) (BREYER,&para;<br>J., dissenting from dismissal of certiorari as improvidently&para;<br>granted); see also, e.g., O’Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, 117&para;<br>(1854); Flook, supra, at 590. Indeed, the introduction of&para;<br>the “useful, concrete, and tangible result” approach to&para;<br>patentability, associated with the Federal Circuit’s State&para;<br>Street decision, preceded the granting of patents that&para;<br>“ranged from the somewhat ridiculous to the truly ab&para;<br>surd.” In re Bilski, 545 F. 3d 943, 1004 (CA Fed. 2008)&para;<br>(Mayer, J., dissenting) (citing patents on, inter alia, a&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BILSKI v. KAPPOS&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>“method of training janitors to dust and vacuum using&para;<br>video displays,” a “system for toilet reservations,” and a&para;<br>“method of using color-coded bracelets to designate dating&para;<br>status in order to limit ‘the embarrassment of rejection’ ”);&para;<br>see also Brief for Respondent 40–41, and n. 20 (listing&para;<br>dubious patents). To the extent that the Federal Circuit’s&para;<br>decision in this case rejected that approach, nothing in&para;<br>today’s decision should be taken as disapproving of that&para;<br>determination. See ante, at 16; ante, at 2, n. 1 (STEVENS,&para;<br>J., concurring in judgment).&para;<br>In sum, it is my view that, in reemphasizing that the&para;<br>“machine-or-transformation” test is not necessarily the&para;<br>sole test of patentability, the Court intends neither to de&para;<br>emphasize the test’s usefulness nor to suggest that many&para;<br>patentable processes lie beyond its reach.&para;<br>III&para;<br>With these observations, I concur in the Court’s&para;<br>judgment.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
