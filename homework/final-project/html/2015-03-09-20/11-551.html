It requires the Secretary to contract to pay the “full&para;<br>amount” of “contract support costs,” 45 U. S. C. §§450j–1(a)(2), (g),&para;<br>subject to the availability of appropriations, §450j–1(b). In the event&para;<br>of a contractual breach, tribal contractors are entitled to seek money&para;<br>damages under the Contract Disputes Act.&para;<br>In Fiscal Years (FYs) 1994 to 2001, respondent Tribes contracted&para;<br>with the Secretary to provide services. During each of those FYs,&para;<br>Congress appropriated sufficient funds to pay any individual tribal&para;<br>contractor’s contract support costs in full but did not appropriate&para;<br>enough to pay all tribal contractors collectively. Unable to pay every&para;<br>contractor in full, the Secretary paid the Tribes on a uniform,&para;<br>pro rata basis. Respondents sued under the Contract Disputes Act&para;<br>for breach of contract. The District Court granted the Government&para;<br>summary judgment. The Tenth Circuit reversed, finding the Government liable to each contractor for the full contract amount.&para;<br>Held: The Government must pay each Tribe’s contract support costs in&para;<br>full. Pp. 5−18.&para;<br>(a) In Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. Leavitt, 543 U. S. 631, this Court&para;<br>considered the Government’s promise to pay contract support costs in&para;<br>ISDA self-determination contracts that made the Government’s obligation “subject to the availability of appropriations,” id., at 634−637.&para;<br>The Government contended that Congress appropriated inadequate&para;<br>funds to fulfill its contractual obligations to the Tribes, while meeting&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>the agency’s competing fiscal priorities. Because Congress appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted funds to pay the contracts, however, the Court held that the Government was obligated to pay those&para;<br>costs in full absent “something special about the promises,” id., at&para;<br>637–638.&para;<br>That conclusion followed directly from well-established principles&para;<br>of Government contracting law: When a Government contractor is&para;<br>one of several persons to be paid out of a larger appropriation sufficient in itself to pay the contractor, the Government is responsible to&para;<br>the contractor for the full amount due under the contract, even if the&para;<br>agency exhausts the appropriation in service of other permissible&para;<br>ends. See Ferris v. United States, 27 Ct. Cl. 542, 546. That is so&para;<br>“even if an agency’s total lump-sum appropriation is insufficient to&para;<br>pay all” of its contracts. Cherokee Nation, 543 U. S., at 637. This&para;<br>principle safeguards both the expectations of Government contractors&para;<br>and the long-term fiscal interests of the United States. Contractors&para;<br>need not keep track of agencies’ shifting priorities and competing obligations; rather, they may trust that the Government will honor its&para;<br>contractual promises. And the rule furthers “the Government’s own&para;<br>long-run interest as a reliable contracting partner in the myriad&para;<br>workaday transaction of its agencies.” United States v. Winstar&para;<br>Corp., 518 U. S. 839, 883. Pp. 5–8.&para;<br>(b) The principles underlying Cherokee Nation and Ferris control&para;<br>here. Once “Congress has appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted&para;<br>funds to pay the contracts at issue, the Government normally cannot&para;<br>back out of a promise on grounds of ‘insufficient appropriations,’ even&para;<br>if the contract uses language such as ‘subject to the availability of&para;<br>appropriations,’ and even if an agency’s total lump-sum appropriation&para;<br>is insufficient to pay all the contracts the agency has made.” Cherokee Nation, 543 U. S., at 637. That condition is satisfied here, because Congress made sufficient funds available to pay any individual&para;<br>contractor in full. Pp. 8−10.&para;<br>(c) The Government attempts to distinguish Ferris and Cherokee&para;<br>Nation on the ground that they involved unrestricted, lump-sum appropriations, while Congress here appropriated “not to exceed” a certain amount for contract support costs. The effect of the appropriations in each case, however, was identical: the agency remained free&para;<br>to allocate funds among multiple contractors, so long as the contracts&para;<br>served the purpose Congress identified. The “not to exceed” language&para;<br>still has legal effect; it prevents the Secretary from reprogramming&para;<br>other funds to pay contract support costs, thereby protecting funds&para;<br>that Congress envisioned for other Bureau of Indian Affairs programs.&para;<br>Section 450j–1(b), which specifies that the Secretary is not required&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>to reduce funding for one tribe’s programs to make funds available to&para;<br>another tribe, does not warrant a different result. Consistent with&para;<br>ordinary Government contracting principles, that language merely&para;<br>underscores the Secretary’s discretion to allocate funds among tribes.&para;<br>It does not alter the Government’s legal obligation when the Secretary fails to pay.&para;<br>The Government’s remaining counterarguments are unpersuasive.&para;<br>First, it suggests that the Secretary could violate the Anti-Deficiency&para;<br>Act, which prevents federal officers from making or authorizing an&para;<br>expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an appropriation. That Act applies only to government officials, however,&para;<br>and does not affect the rights of citizens contracting with the Government. Second, the Government argues that permitting respondents to recover from the Judgment Fund would circumvent Congress’&para;<br>intent to cap total expenditures for contract support costs. But ISDA&para;<br>expressly provides that tribal contractors may sue for “money damages” under the Contract Disputes Act, and any ensuing judgments&para;<br>are payable from the Judgment Fund. See Cherokee Nation, 543&para;<br>U. S., at 642. Third, the Government invokes cases in which courts&para;<br>have rejected contractors’ attempts to recover for amounts beyond the&para;<br>maximum appropriated by Congress for a particular purpose. See,&para;<br>e.g., Sutton v. United States, 256 U. S. 575. However, Sutton involved a specific line-item appropriation for an amount beyond which&para;<br>the sole contractor could not recover. This case involves several contractors, each of whom contracted within the lump-sum amount Congress appropriated for all contractors. Unlike the sole contractor in&para;<br>Sutton, they cannot reasonably be expected to know how much remained available of Congress’ lump-sum appropriation. Finally, the&para;<br>Government claims that legislative history suggests that Congress&para;<br>approved of pro rata distribution, but “indicia in committee reports&para;<br>and other legislative history as to how funds should or are expected&para;<br>to be spent do not establish any legal requirement on the agency.”&para;<br>Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U. S. 182, 192. Pp. 11−17.&para;<br>(d) This case is the product of two decisions in some tension: Congress required the Secretary to accept every qualifying ISDA contract, promising “full” funding for all contract support costs, but then&para;<br>appropriated insufficient funds to pay in full each tribal contractor.&para;<br>Responsibility for the resolution of that situation, however, is committed to Congress.

C. §450 et seq., directs the&para;<br>Secretary of the Interior to enter into contracts with willing tribes, pursuant to which those tribes will provide&para;<br>services such as education and law enforcement that&para;<br>otherwise would have been provided by the Federal Government. ISDA mandates that the Secretary shall pay&para;<br>the full amount of “contract support costs” incurred by&para;<br>tribes in performing their contracts. At issue in this case&para;<br>is whether the Government must pay those costs when&para;<br>Congress appropriates sufficient funds to pay in full any&para;<br>individual contractor’s contract support costs, but not&para;<br>enough funds to cover the aggregate amount due every&para;<br>contractor. Consistent with longstanding principles of&para;<br>Government contracting law, we hold that the Government must pay each tribe’s contract support costs in full.&para;<br>I&para;<br>A&para;<br>Congress enacted ISDA in 1975 in order to achieve&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“maximum Indian participation in the direction of educational as well as other Federal services to Indian communities so as to render such services more responsive to the&para;<br>needs and desires of those communities.” 25 U. S. C.&para;<br>§450a(a). To that end, the Act directs the Secretary of the&para;<br>Interior, “upon the request of any Indian tribe . . . to enter&para;<br>into a self-determination contract . . . to plan, conduct, and&para;<br>administer” health, education, economic, and social programs that the Secretary otherwise would have administered. §450f(a)(1).&para;<br>As originally enacted, ISDA required the Government to&para;<br>provide contracting tribes with an amount of funds equivalent to those that the Secretary “would have otherwise provided for his direct operation of the programs.”&para;<br>§106(h), 88 Stat. 2211. It soon became apparent that this&para;<br>secretarial amount failed to account for the full costs to&para;<br>tribes of providing services. Because of “concern with&para;<br>Government’s past failure adequately to reimburse tribes’&para;<br>indirect administrative costs,” Cherokee Nation of Okla. v.&para;<br>Leavitt, 543 U. S. 631, 639 (2005), Congress amended&para;<br>ISDA to require the Secretary to contract to pay the “full&para;<br>amount” of “contract support costs” related to each selfdetermination contract, §§450j–1(a)(2), (g).1 The Act also&para;<br>provides, however, that “[n]otwithstanding any other&para;<br>provision in [ISDA], the provision of funds under [ISDA] is&para;<br>subject to the availability of appropriations.” §450j–1(b).&para;<br>Congress included a model contract in ISDA and di——————&para;<br>1 As defined by ISDA, contract support costs “shall consist of an&para;<br>amount for the reasonable costs for activities which must be carried on&para;<br>by a tribal organization as a contractor to ensure compliance with the&para;<br>terms of the contract and prudent management, but which . . . (A)&para;<br>normally are not carried on by the respective Secretary in his direct&para;<br>operation of the program; or (B) are provided by the Secretary in&para;<br>support of the contracted program from resources other than those&para;<br>under contract.” §450j–1(a)(2). Such costs include overhead administrative costs, as well as expenses such as federally mandated audits&para;<br>and liability insurance. See Cherokee Nation of Okla., 543 U. S., at 635.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

That&para;<br>amount “ ‘shall not be less than the applicable amount&para;<br>determined pursuant to [§450j–1(a)],’ ” which includes&para;<br>contract support costs. Ibid.; §450j–1(a)(2). The contract&para;<br>indicates that “ ‘[e]ach provision of [ISDA] and each provision of this Contract shall be liberally construed for the&para;<br>benefit of the Contractor . . . .’ ” §450l(c), (model agreement §1(a)(2)). Finally, the Act makes clear that if&para;<br>the Government fails to pay the amount contracted for,&para;<br>then tribal contractors are entitled to pursue “money damages” in accordance with the Contract Disputes Act.&para;<br>§450m–1(a).&para;<br>B&para;<br>During Fiscal Years (FYs) 1994 to 2001, respondent&para;<br>Tribes contracted with the Secretary of the Interior to&para;<br>provide services such as law enforcement, environmental&para;<br>protection, and agricultural assistance. The Tribes fully&para;<br>performed. During each FY, Congress appropriated a&para;<br>total amount to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) “for the&para;<br>operation of Indian programs.” See, e.g., Department of&para;<br>the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,&para;<br>2000, 113 Stat. 1501A–148. Of that sum, Congress provided that “not to exceed [a particular amount] shall be&para;<br>available for payments to tribes and tribal organizations for contract support costs” under ISDA. E.g., ibid.&para;<br>Thus, in FY 2000, for example, Congress appropriated&para;<br>$1,670,444,000 to the BIA, of which “not to exceed&para;<br>$120,229,000” was allocated for contract support costs.&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>During each relevant FY, Congress appropriated sufficient funds to pay in full any individual tribal contractor’s&para;<br>contract support costs. Congress did not, however, appropriate sufficient funds to cover the contract support costs&para;<br>due all tribal contractors collectively. Between FY 1994&para;<br>and 2001, appropriations covered only between 77% and&para;<br>92% of tribes’ aggregate contract support costs. The extent of the shortfall was not revealed until each fiscal year&para;<br>was well underway, at which point a tribe’s performance&para;<br>of its contractual obligations was largely complete. See&para;<br>644 F. 3d 1054, 1061 (CA10 2011). Lacking funds to pay&para;<br>each contractor in full, the Secretary paid tribes’ contract&para;<br>support costs on a uniform, pro rata basis. Tribes responded to these shortfalls by reducing ISDA services to&para;<br>tribal members, diverting tribal resources from non-ISDA&para;<br>programs, and forgoing opportunities to contract in furtherance of Congress’ self-determination objective. GAO,&para;<br>V. Rezendes, Indian Self-Determination Act: Shortfalls in&para;<br>Indian Contract Support Costs Need to Be Addressed 3–4&para;<br>(GAO/RCED–99–150, 2009).&para;<br>Respondent Tribes sued for breach of contract pursuant&para;<br>to the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U. S. C. §§601–613, alleging that the Government failed to pay the full amount of&para;<br>contract support costs due from FY 1994 through 2001,&para;<br>as required by ISDA and their contracts. The United&para;<br>States District Court for the District of New Mexico granted&para;<br>summary judgment for the Government. A divided panel&para;<br>of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed. The court reasoned that Congress made&para;<br>sufficient appropriations “legally available” to fund any&para;<br>individual tribal contractor’s contract support costs, and&para;<br>that the Government’s contractual commitment was therefore binding. 644 F. 3d, at 1063–1065. In such cases, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals held that the Government is liable to&para;<br>each contractor for the full contract amount.

S., at 634–637. For each FY at&para;<br>issue, Congress had appropriated to the Indian Health&para;<br>Service (IHS) a lump sum between $1.277 and $1.419&para;<br>billion, “far more than the [contract support cost]&para;<br>amounts” due under the Tribes’ individual contracts. Id.,&para;<br>at 637; see id., at 636 (Cherokee Nation and ShoshonePaiute Tribes filed claims seeking $3.4 and $3.5 million,&para;<br>respectively). The Government contended, however, that&para;<br>Congress had appropriated inadequate funds to enable the&para;<br>IHS to pay the Tribes’ contract support costs in full, while&para;<br>meeting all of the agency’s competing fiscal priorities.&para;<br>As we explained, that did not excuse the Government’s&para;<br>responsibility to pay the Tribes. We stressed that the&para;<br>Government’s obligation to pay contract support costs&para;<br>should be treated as an ordinary contract promise, noting&para;<br>that ISDA “uses the word ‘contract’ 426 times to describe&para;<br>the nature of the Government’s promise.” Id., at 639. As&para;<br>even the Government conceded, “in the case of ordinary&para;<br>contracts . . . ‘if the amount of an unrestricted appropriation is sufficient to fund the contract, the contractor is&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Compare 644 F. 3d 1054 (case below), with Arctic Slope Native&para;<br>Assn., Ltd. v.

RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>entitled to payment even if the agency has allocated&para;<br>the funds to another purpose or assumes other obligations&para;<br>that exhaust the funds.’ ” Id., at 641. It followed, therefore, that absent “something special about the promises at&para;<br>issue,” the Government was obligated to pay the Tribes’&para;<br>contract support costs in full. Id., at 638.&para;<br>We held that the mere fact that ISDA self-determination&para;<br>contracts are made “subject to the availability of appropriations” did not warrant a special rule. Id., at 643 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). That commonplace provision,&para;<br>we explained, is ordinarily satisfied so long as Congress&para;<br>appropriates adequate legally unrestricted funds to pay&para;<br>the contracts at issue. See ibid. Because Congress made&para;<br>sufficient funds legally available to the agency to pay the&para;<br>Tribes’ contracts, it did not matter that the BIA had allocated some of those funds to serve other purposes, such&para;<br>that the remainder was insufficient to pay the Tribes in&para;<br>full. Rather, we agreed with the Tribes that “as long as&para;<br>Congress has appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted&para;<br>funds to pay the contracts at issue,” the Government’s&para;<br>promise to pay was binding. Id., at 637–638.&para;<br>Our conclusion in Cherokee Nation followed directly&para;<br>from well-established principles of Government contracting law. When a Government contractor is one of several&para;<br>persons to be paid out of a larger appropriation sufficient&para;<br>in itself to pay the contractor, it has long been the rule&para;<br>that the Government is responsible to the contractor for&para;<br>the full amount due under the contract, even if the agency&para;<br>exhausts the appropriation in service of other permissible&para;<br>ends. See Ferris v. United States, 27 Ct. Cl. 542, 546&para;<br>(1892); Dougherty v. United States, 18 Ct. Cl. 496, 503&para;<br>(1883); see also 2 GAO, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, p. 6–17 (2d ed. 1992) (hereinafter GAO&para;<br>Redbook).3 That is so “even if an agency’s total lump-sum&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 In&para;<br>&para;<br>Ferris, for instance, Congress appropriated $45,000 for the im-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

S. 571, 580 (1934) (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). Although the agency itself cannot disburse funds beyond those appropriated to it, the Government’s “valid obligations will remain enforceable in the&para;<br>courts.” GAO Redbook, p. 6–17.&para;<br>This principle safeguards both the expectations of Government contractors and the long-term fiscal interests of&para;<br>the United States. For contractors, the Ferris rule reflects&para;<br>that when “a contract is but one activity under a larger&para;<br>appropriation, it is not reasonable to expect the contractor&para;<br>to know how much of that appropriation remains available&para;<br>for it at any given time.” GAO Redbook, p. 6–18. Contractors are responsible for knowing the size of the pie, not&para;<br>how the agency elects to slice it. Thus, so long as Congress appropriates adequate funds to cover a prospective&para;<br>contract, contractors need not keep track of agencies’&para;<br>shifting priorities and competing obligations; rather, they&para;<br>may trust that the Government will honor its contractual&para;<br>promises.

If the Government could be trusted to fulfill its&para;<br>promise to pay only when more pressing fiscal needs did&para;<br>not arise, would-be contractors would bargain warily—if&para;<br>at all—and only at a premium large enough to account for&para;<br>the risk of nonpayment.

Under&para;<br>our previous interpretation of that language, that condition was satisfied here because Congress appropriated&para;<br>adequate funds to pay in full any individual contractor. It&para;<br>is important to afford that language a “uniform interpretation” in this and comparable statutes, “lest legal uncertainty undermine contractors’ confidence that they will be&para;<br>paid, and in turn increase the cost to the Government of&para;<br>purchasing goods and services.” Ibid.

The Government, in effect, must demonstrate that its reading is&para;<br>clearly required by the statutory language. Accordingly,&para;<br>the Government cannot back out of its contractual promise&para;<br>to pay each Tribe’s full contract support costs.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 The Government’s reliance on this statutory language is particularly&para;<br>curious because it suggests it is superfluous.

See Brief for Petitioners 26,&para;<br>49. The Government argues, on this basis, that Ferris and&para;<br>Cherokee Nation involved “contracts made against the backdrop of unrestricted, lump-sum appropriations,” while this&para;<br>case does not. See Brief for Petitioners 49, 26.&para;<br>That premise, however, is inaccurate. In Ferris, Congress appropriated “[f]or improving Delaware River below&para;<br>Bridesburg, Pennsylvania, forty-five thousand dollars.” 20&para;<br>Stat. 364. As explained in the Government’s own appropriations law handbook, the “not to exceed” language at&para;<br>issue in this case has an identical meaning to the quoted&para;<br>language in Ferris. See GAO Redbook, p. 6–5 (“Words like&para;<br>‘not to exceed’ are not the only way to establish a maximum limitation. If the appropriation includes a specific&para;<br>amount for a particular object (such as ‘For Cuban cigars,&para;<br>$100’), then the appropriation is a maximum which may&para;<br>not be exceeded”). The appropriation in Cherokee Nation&para;<br>took a similar form. See, e.g., 108 Stat. 2527–2528 (“For&para;<br>expenses necessary to carry out . . . ISDA [and certain&para;<br>other enumerated Acts], $1,713,052,000”). There is no basis, therefore, for distinguishing the class of appropriation in those cases from this one. In each case, the agency&para;<br>remained free to allocate funds among multiple contractors, so long as the contracts served the purpose Congress&para;<br>identified.&para;<br>This result does not leave the “not to exceed” language&para;<br>in Congress’ appropriation without legal effect.

But when an agency makes competing contractual commitments with legally available funds and then&para;<br>fails to pay, it is the Government that must bear the fiscal&para;<br>consequences, not the contractor.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The dissent attempts to distinguish this case from Cherokee Nation and Ferris on different grounds, relying on&para;<br>§450j–1(b)’s proviso that “the Secretary is not required to&para;<br>reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe.” In&para;<br>the dissent’s view, that clause establishes that each dollar allocated by the Secretary reduces the amount of appropriations legally available to pay other contractors. In&para;<br>effect, the dissent understands §450j–1(b) to make the&para;<br>legal availability of appropriations turn on the Secretary’s&para;<br>expenditures rather than the sum allocated by Congress.&para;<br>That interpretation, which is inconsistent with ordinary&para;<br>principles of Government contracting law, is improbable.&para;<br>We have explained that Congress ordinarily controls the&para;<br>availability of appropriations; the agency controls whether&para;<br>to make funds from that appropriation available to pay a&para;<br>contractor. See Cherokee Nation, 543 U. S., at 642–643.&para;<br>The agency’s allocation choices do not affect the Government’s liability in the event of an underpayment.

The dissent’s real argument is that §450j–1(b) reverses the&para;<br>applicability of the Ferris rule to ISDA, so that the Secretary’s allocation of funds to one contractor reduces the legal availability of funds to&para;<br>others. See post, at 4 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (“that the Secretary&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

The dissent’s reading, by contrast, would impose precisely that&para;<br>regime. See post, at 4–5.&para;<br>The better reading of §450j–1(b) accords with ordinary&para;<br>Government contracting principles. As we explained, supra, at 9, the clause underscores the Secretary’s discretion to allocate funds among tribes, but does not alter the&para;<br>Government’s legal obligation when the agency fails to&para;<br>pay. That reading gives full effect to the clause’s text,&para;<br>which addresses the “amount of funds provided,” and&para;<br>specifies that the Secretary is not required to reduce funding for one tribe to make “funds available” to another.&para;<br>450j–1(b). Indeed, even the Government acknowledges&para;<br>the clause governs the Secretary’s discretion to distribute&para;<br>funds. See Brief for Petitioners 52 (pursuant to §450j–&para;<br>1(b), the Secretary was not obligated to pay tribes’ “contract support costs on a first-come, first-served basis, but&para;<br>had the authority to distribute the available money among&para;<br>all tribal contractors in an equitable fashion”).&para;<br>At minimum, the fact that we, the court below, the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>could have allocated the funds to [a] tribe is irrelevant. What matters&para;<br>is what the Secretary does, and once he allocates the funds to one tribe,&para;<br>they are not available to another”). We are not persuaded that §450j–&para;<br>1(b) was intended to enact that radical departure from ordinary Government contracting principles. Indeed, Congress has spoken clearly&para;<br>and directly when limiting the Government’s total contractual liability&para;<br>to an amount appropriated in similar schemes; that it did not do so&para;<br>here further counsels against the dissent’s reading. See, e.g., 25&para;<br>U. S.

Because ISDA is construed in favor of tribes, that conclusion is fatal to the&para;<br>dissent.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The remaining counterarguments are unpersuasive.&para;<br>First, the Government suggests that today’s holding could&para;<br>cause the Secretary to violate the Anti-Deficiency Act,&para;<br>which prevents federal officers from “mak[ing] or authoriz[ing] an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount&para;<br>available in an appropriation.” 31 U.

Congress expressly provided in ISDA that&para;<br>tribal contractors were entitled to sue for “money damages” under the Contract Disputes Act upon the Government’s failure to pay, 25 U. S. C. §§450m–1(a), (d), and&para;<br>judgments against the Government under that Act are&para;<br>payable from the Judgment Fund, 41 U. S. C. §7108(a).9&para;<br>Indeed, we cited the Contract Disputes Act, Judgment&para;<br>Fund, and Anti-Deficiency Act in Cherokee Nation, explaining that if the Government commits its appropriations in a manner that leaves contractual obligations&para;<br>unfulfilled, “the contractor [is] free to pursue appropriate&para;<br>legal remedies arising because the Government broke its&para;<br>contractual promise.” 543 U. S., at 642.&para;<br>Third, the Government invokes cases in which courts&para;<br>have rejected contractors’ attempts to recover for amounts&para;<br>beyond the maximum appropriated by Congress for a&para;<br>particular purpose. See, e.g., Sutton v. United States, 256&para;<br>U. S. 575 (1921). In Sutton, for instance, Congress made a&para;<br>specific line-item appropriation of $23,000 for the completion of a particular project. Id., at 577.

Richmond, 496 U. S. 414 (1990), is misplaced. In&para;<br>Richmond, we held that the Appropriations Clause does not permit&para;<br>plaintiffs to recover money for Government-caused injuries for which&para;<br>Congress “appropriated no money.” Id., at 424. Richmond, however,&para;<br>indicated that the Appropriations Clause is no bar to recovery in a case&para;<br>like this one, in which “the express terms of a specific statute” establish&para;<br>“a substantive right to compensation” from the Judgment Fund.

GAO Redbook, p. 6–18. “[I]t is settled that&para;<br>contractors paid from a general appropriation are not&para;<br>barred from recovering for breach of contract even though&para;<br>the appropriation is exhausted,” but that “under a specific&para;<br>line-item appropriation, the answer is different.” Ibid.10&para;<br>The different results “follo[w] logically from the old maxim&para;<br>that ignorance of the law is no excuse.” Ibid. “If Congress&para;<br>appropriates a specific dollar amount for a particular&para;<br>contract, that amount is specified in the appropriation act&para;<br>and the contractor is deemed to know it.” Ibid. This case&para;<br>is far different. Hundreds of tribes entered into thousands&para;<br>of independent contracts, each for amounts well within the&para;<br>lump sum appropriated by Congress to pay contract support costs. Here, where each Tribe’s “contract is but one&para;<br>activity under a larger appropriation, it is not reasonable&para;<br>to expect [each] contractor to know how much of that&para;<br>appropriation remain[ed] available for it at any given&para;<br>time.” Ibid.; see also Ferris, 27 Ct. Cl., at 546.&para;<br>Finally, the Government argues that legislative history&para;<br>suggests that Congress approved of the distribution of&para;<br>available funds on a uniform, pro rata basis. But “a fundamental principle of appropriations law is that where&para;<br>Congress merely appropriates lump-sum amounts without&para;<br>statutorily restricting what can be done with those funds,&para;<br>a clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose&para;<br>legally binding restrictions.” Lincoln, 508 U.

For example, an appropriation for&para;<br>building two ships “could be viewed as a line-item appropriation in&para;<br>relation to the broader ‘Shipbuilding and Conversion’ category, but it&para;<br>was also a lump-sum appropriation in relation to the two specific&para;<br>vessels included.” Ibid. So long as a contractor does not seek payment&para;<br>beyond the amount Congress made legally available for a given purpose, “[t]his factual distinction does not affect the legal principle.” Ibid.&para;<br>See also In re Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., 55 Comp.&para;<br>Gen. 812 (1976).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

(internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). An agency’s discretion to spend&para;<br>appropriated funds is cabined only by the “text of the&para;<br>appropriation,” not by Congress’ expectations of how the&para;<br>funds will be spent, as might be reflected by legislative&para;<br>history. Int’l Union, UAW, 746 F. 2d, at 860–861. That&para;<br>principle also reflects the same ideas underlying Ferris. If&para;<br>a contractor’s right to payment varied based on a future&para;<br>court’s uncertain interpretation of legislative history, it&para;<br>would increase the Government’s cost of contracting. Cf.&para;<br>Cherokee Nation, 543 U. S., at 644. That long-run expense&para;<br>would likely far exceed whatever money might be saved in&para;<br>any individual case.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>As the Government points out, the state of affairs resulting in this case is the product of two congressional&para;<br>decisions which the BIA has found difficult to reconcile.&para;<br>On the one hand, Congress obligated the Secretary to&para;<br>accept every qualifying ISDA contract, which includes a&para;<br>promise of “full” funding for all contract support costs. On&para;<br>the other, Congress appropriated insufficient funds to pay&para;<br>in full each tribal contractor. The Government’s frustration is understandable, but the dilemma’s resolution is the&para;<br>responsibility of Congress.&para;<br>Congress is not short of options. For instance, it could&para;<br>reduce the Government’s financial obligation by amending&para;<br>ISDA to remove the statutory mandate compelling the BIA&para;<br>to enter into self-determination contracts, or by giving the&para;<br>BIA flexibility to pay less than the full amount of contract&para;<br>support costs. It could also pass a moratorium on the&para;<br>formation of new self-determination contracts, as it has&para;<br>done before. See §328, 112 Stat. 2681–291 to 292.

Indeed, there&para;<br>is some evidence that Congress may do just that. See&para;<br>H. R. Rep.

The question in this case is whether appropriations were “available” during fiscal years 1994&para;<br>through 2001 to pay all the contract support costs incurred&para;<br>by the Tribes. Only if appropriations were “available”&para;<br>may the Tribes hold the Government liable for the unpaid&para;<br>amounts.&para;<br>Congress restricted the amount of funds “available” to&para;<br>pay the Tribes’ contract support costs in two ways. First,&para;<br>in each annual appropriations statute for the Department of the Interior from fiscal year 1994 to 2001, Congress provided that spending on contract support costs for&para;<br>all tribes was “not to exceed” a certain amount. The&para;<br>fiscal year 1995 appropriations statute is representative.&para;<br>It provided: “For operation of Indian programs . . . ,&para;<br>$1,526,778,000, . . . of which not to exceed $95,823,000&para;<br>shall be for payments to tribes and tribal organizations for&para;<br>contract support costs . . . .” 108 Stat. 2510–2511. As the&para;<br>Court acknowledges, ante, at 11–12, the phrase “not to&para;<br>exceed” has a settled meaning in federal appropriations&para;<br>law. By use of the phrase, Congress imposed a cap on the&para;<br>total funds available for contract support costs in each&para;<br>fiscal year. See 2 General Accounting Office, Principles of&para;<br>Federal Appropriations Law, p. 6–8 (2d ed. 1992) (hereinafter GAO Redbook) (“[T]he most effective way to establish&para;<br>a maximum . . . earmark is by the words ‘not to exceed’ or&para;<br>‘not more than’ ”).&para;<br>Second, in §450j–1(b) itself—in the very same sentence&para;<br>that conditions funding on the “availability of appropriations”—Congress provided that “the Secretary [of the&para;<br>Interior] is not required to reduce funding for programs,&para;<br>projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe or tribal organization under [the Act].”&para;<br>An agency may be required to shift funds from one object&para;<br>to another, within statutory limits, when doing so is&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

But the “reduction” clause&para;<br>in §450j–1(b) expressly provides that the Secretary is “not&para;<br>required” to engage in such reprogramming to make one&para;<br>tribe’s funds “available to another tribe.” It follows that&para;<br>appropriations allocated for “programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe” are not “available” to another tribe,&para;<br>unless the Secretary reallocates them. Contrary to the&para;<br>Court’s suggestion, ante, at 13–14, the Government shares&para;<br>this view that the “reduction” clause “specifically relieves&para;<br>the Secretary of any obligation to make funds available to&para;<br>one contractor by reducing payments to others.” Brief for&para;<br>Petitioners 51 (citing Arctic Slope Native Assn., Ltd. v.&para;<br>Sebelius, 629 F. 3d 1296, 1304 (CA Fed. 2010), cert. pending, No. 11–83 (filed July 18, 2011)).&para;<br>Given these express restrictions established by Congress—which no one doubts are valid—I cannot agree with&para;<br>the Court’s conclusion that appropriations were “available” to pay the Tribes’ contract support costs in full.&para;<br>Once the Secretary had allocated all the funds appropriated&para;<br>for contract support costs, no other funds could be used&para;<br>for that purpose without violating the “not to exceed” restrictions in the relevant appropriations statutes.

That leaves only one other&para;<br>possible source of funds to pay the disputed costs in this&para;<br>case: funds appropriated for contract support costs, but&para;<br>allocated to pay such costs incurred by other tribes. Those&para;<br>funds were not “available” either, however, because they&para;<br>were “funding for programs, projects, or activities serving&para;<br>a tribe,” and the Secretary was not required to reduce&para;<br>such funding “to make funds available to another tribe.”&para;<br>§450j–1(b).&para;<br>In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Court fails to&para;<br>appreciate the full significance of the “reduction” clause in&para;<br>§450j–1(b). As construed by the Court, that clause merely&para;<br>confirms that the Secretary “may allocate funds to one&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tribe at the expense of another.” Ante, at 9. But as explained above, the clause does more than that: It also&para;<br>establishes that when the Secretary does allocate funds to&para;<br>one tribe at the expense of another, the latter tribe has no&para;<br>right to those funds—the funds are not “available” to it.&para;<br>The fact that the Secretary could have allocated the funds&para;<br>to the other tribe is irrelevant. What matters is what the&para;<br>Secretary actually does, and once he allocates the funds to&para;<br>one tribe, they are not “available” to another.&para;<br>The Court rejects this reading of the “reduction” clause,&para;<br>on the ground that it would constitute a “radical departure&para;<br>from ordinary Government contracting principles.” Ante,&para;<br>at 13, n. 6. But the fact that the clause operates as a&para;<br>constraint on the “availability of appropriations” is evident&para;<br>not only from its text, which speaks in terms of “funds&para;<br>available,” but also from its placement in the statute,&para;<br>immediately following the “subject to the availability”&para;<br>clause. Under the Court’s view, by contrast, the “reduction” clause merely “underscores the Secretary’s discretion&para;<br>to allocate funds among tribes.” Ante, at 13. There is,&para;<br>however, no reason to suppose that Congress enacted the&para;<br>provision simply to confirm this “ordinary” rule. Ibid. We&para;<br>generally try to avoid reading statutes to be so “insignificant.” TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>The Court maintains that its holding is compelled by&para;<br>our decision in Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. Leavitt, 543&para;<br>U. S. 631 (2005). Ante, at 8. Like respondents here, the&para;<br>tribes in Cherokee Nation sued the Government for unpaid&para;<br>contract support costs under the Act. Congress had appropriated certain sums to the Indian Health Service “[f]or&para;<br>expenses necessary to carry out” the Act, e.g., 108 Stat.&para;<br>2527–2528, but—unlike in this case—those appropriations&para;<br>“contained no relevant statutory restriction,” 543 U. S., at&para;<br>637. The Government in Cherokee Nation contended that&para;<br>it was not obligated to pay the contract support costs as&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>promised, in light of the “reduction” clause in §450j–1(b).&para;<br>The Government argued that the clause “makes nonbinding a promise to pay one tribe’s costs where doing so would&para;<br>require funds that the Government would otherwise devote to ‘programs, projects, or activities serving . . . another tribe.’ ” Id., at 641 (quoting §450j–1(b)).&para;<br>We ruled against the Government, but not because of&para;<br>any disagreement with its reading of the “reduction”&para;<br>clause. The basis for our decision was instead that “the&para;<br>relevant congressional appropriations contained other&para;<br>unrestricted funds, small in amount but sufficient to pay&para;<br>the claims at issue.” 543 U. S., at 641 (emphasis altered).&para;<br>Those funds were allocated for “ ‘inherent federal functions,’ such as the cost of running the Indian Health Service’s central Washington office.” Id., at 641–642. They&para;<br>were not restricted by the “reduction” clause, because they&para;<br>were not funds for “ ‘programs, projects, or activities serving . . . another tribe.’ ” Id., at 641 (quoting §450j–1(b)).&para;<br>Nor were they restricted by the pertinent appropriations&para;<br>statutes, which, as noted, contained no relevant limiting&para;<br>language. See ibid. We therefore held that those funds—&para;<br>which we described as “unrestricted” throughout our&para;<br>opinion, id., at 641, 642, 643, 647—were available to pay&para;<br>the disputed contract support costs.&para;<br>As even the Tribes concede, Cherokee Nation does not&para;<br>control this case. Tr. of Oral Arg. 39 (“I don’t think this&para;<br>case is controlled by Cherokee” (counsel for the Tribes)).&para;<br>The reason is not that the appropriations statutes in this&para;<br>case contained “not to exceed” caps while those in Cherokee Nation did not. The Court is correct that appropriating an amount “for” a particular purpose has the same&para;<br>effect as providing that appropriations for that purpose&para;<br>are “not to exceed” that amount. Ante, at 11. What makes&para;<br>this case different is where Congress drew the line. In&para;<br>Cherokee Nation, the statutes capped funding for “expenses&para;<br>necessary to carry out” the Act, a category that included&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>SALAZAR v. RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>funding for both “inherent federal functions” and contract&para;<br>support costs. Accordingly, funding for one could be used&para;<br>for the other, without violating the cap. Here, by contrast,&para;<br>the statutes capped funding for contract support costs&para;<br>specifically. Thus, once the Secretary exhausted those&para;<br>funds, he could not reprogram other funds—such as&para;<br>funds for “inherent federal functions”—to pay the costs.&para;<br>With the caps in place, moreover, the “reduction” clause, as&para;<br>explained above, rendered unavailable the only possible&para;<br>source of funds left: funds already allocated for other&para;<br>contract support costs. Unlike in Cherokee Nation, therefore, there were no unrestricted funds to pay the costs at&para;<br>issue in this case. The Court’s quotation from Cherokee&para;<br>Nation concerning “when an ‘ “unrestricted appropriation&para;<br>is sufficient to fund the contract,” ’ ” ante, at 12 (emphasis&para;<br>added) (quoting Cherokee Nation, supra, at 641), is accordingly beside the point.&para;<br>The Court also relies on Ferris v. United States, 27 Ct.&para;<br>Cl. 542 (1892). That case involved a government contract&para;<br>to dredge the Delaware River. When work under the&para;<br>contract stopped because funds from the relevant appropriation had been exhausted, a contractor sued the Government for breach of contract, and the Court of Claims&para;<br>held that he was entitled to recover lost profits. As the&para;<br>court explained, “[a] contractor who is one of several persons to be paid out of an appropriation is not chargeable&para;<br>with knowledge of its administration, nor can his legal&para;<br>rights be affected or impaired by its maladministration or&para;<br>by its diversion, whether legal or illegal, to other objects.”&para;<br>Id., at 546. That principle, however, cannot “dictate the&para;<br>result in this case.” Ante, at 8. The statute in Ferris&para;<br>appropriated an amount “[f]or improving [the] Delaware&para;<br>River,” which prevented spending for that purpose beyond&para;<br>the specified amount. 20 Stat. 364. But in that case, all&para;<br>funds appropriated for that purpose were equally available to all contractors. Here that is not true; §450j–1(b)&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>makes clear that funds allocated to one contractor are not&para;<br>available to another. Thus, the principle in Ferris does not&para;<br>apply.&para;<br>It is true, as the Court notes, ante, at 10, that each of&para;<br>the Tribes’ contracts provides that the Act and the contract “shall be liberally construed for the benefit of the&para;<br>Contractor.” App. 203; see also §450l(c) (Model Agreement&para;<br>§1(a)(2)). But a provision can be construed “liberally” as&para;<br>opposed to “strictly” only when there is some ambiguity to&para;<br>construe. And here there is none. Congress spoke clearly&para;<br>when it said that the provision of funds was “subject to the&para;<br>availability of appropriations,” that spending on contract&para;<br>support costs was “not to exceed” a specific amount, and&para;<br>that the Secretary was “not required” to make funds allocated for one tribe’s costs “available” to another. The&para;<br>unambiguous meaning of these provisions is that when&para;<br>the Secretary has allocated the maximum amount of funds&para;<br>appropriated each fiscal year for contract support costs,&para;<br>there are no other appropriations “available” to pay any&para;<br>remaining costs.&para;<br>This is hardly a typical government contracts case.&para;<br>Many government contracts contain a “subject to the&para;<br>availability of appropriations” clause, and many appropriations statutes contain “not to exceed” language. But this&para;<br>case involves not only those provisions but a third, relieving the Secretary of any obligation to make funds “available” to one contractor by reducing payments to others.&para;<br>Such provisions will not always appear together, but when&para;<br>they do, we must give them effect. Doing so here, I would&para;<br>hold that the Tribes are not entitled to payment of their&para;<br>contract support costs in full, and I would reverse the&para;<br>contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth&para;<br>Circuit.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
