Argued January 13, 2010—Decided April 21, 2010&para;<br>The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U. S. C. §1692 et&para;<br>seq., imposes civil liability on “debt collector[s]” for certain prohibited&para;<br>debt collection practices. A debt collector who “fails to comply with&para;<br>any [FDCPA] provision . . . with respect to any person is liable to&para;<br>such person” for “actual damage[s],” costs, “a reasonable attorney’s&para;<br>fee as determined by the court,” and statutory “additional damages.”&para;<br>§1692k(a). In addition, violations of the FDCPA are deemed unfair or&para;<br>deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act&para;<br>(FTC Act), §41 et seq., which is enforced by the Federal Trade Com&para;<br>mission (FTC). See §1692l. A debt collector who acts with “actual&para;<br>knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective cir&para;<br>cumstances that such act is [prohibited under the FDCPA]” is subject&para;<br>to civil penalties enforced by the FTC. §§45(m)(1)(A), (C). A debt col&para;<br>lector is not liable in any action brought under the FDCPA, however,&para;<br>if it “shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not&para;<br>intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the&para;<br>maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such er&para;<br>ror.” §1692k(c).&para;<br>Respondents, a law firm and one of its attorneys (collectively Car&para;<br>lisle), filed a lawsuit in Ohio state court on behalf of a mortgage com&para;<br>pany to foreclose a mortgage on real property owned by petitioner&para;<br>Jerman. The complaint included a notice that the mortgage debt&para;<br>would be assumed valid unless Jerman disputed it in writing. Jer&para;<br>man’s lawyer sent a letter disputing the debt, and, when the mort&para;<br>gage company acknowledged that the debt had in fact been paid, Car&para;<br>lisle withdrew the suit. Jerman then filed this action, contending&para;<br>that by sending the notice requiring her to dispute the debt in writ&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, &para;<br>&para;<br>KRAMER &amp; ULRICH LPA &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>ing, Carlisle had violated §1692g(a) of the FDCPA, which governs the&para;<br>contents of notices to debtors. The District Court, acknowledging a&para;<br>division of authority on the question, held that Carlisle had violated&para;<br>§1692g(a) but ultimately granted Carlisle summary judgment under&para;<br>§1692k(c)’s “bona fide error” defense. The Sixth Circuit affirmed,&para;<br>holding that the defense in §1692k(c) is not limited to clerical or fac&para;<br>tual errors, but extends to mistakes of law.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The bona fide error defense in §1692k(c) does not apply to a viola&para;<br>tion resulting from a debt collector’s mistaken interpretation of the&para;<br>legal requirements of the FDCPA. Pp. 6–30.&para;<br>(a) A violation resulting from a debt collector’s misinterpretation of&para;<br>the legal requirements of the FDCPA cannot be “not intentional” un&para;<br>der §1692k(c). It is a common maxim that “ignorance of the law will&para;<br>not excuse any person, either civilly or criminally.” Barlow v. United&para;<br>States, 7 Pet. 404, 411. When Congress has intended to provide a&para;<br>mistake-of-law defense to civil liability, it has often done so more ex&para;<br>plicitly than here. In particular, the administrative-penalty provi&para;<br>sions of the FTC Act, which are expressly incorporated into the&para;<br>FDCPA, apply only when a debt collector acts with “actual knowledge&para;<br>or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances”&para;<br>that the FDCPA prohibited its action. §§45(m)(1)(A), (C). Given the&para;<br>absence of similar language in §1692k(c), it is fair to infer that Con&para;<br>gress permitted injured consumers to recover damages for “inten&para;<br>tional” conduct, including violations resulting from a mistaken inter&para;<br>pretation of the FDCPA, while reserving the more onerous&para;<br>administrative penalties for debt collectors whose intentional actions&para;<br>reflected knowledge that the conduct was prohibited. Congress also&para;<br>did not confine FDCPA liability to “willful” violations, a term more of&para;<br>ten understood in the civil context to exclude mistakes of law. See,&para;<br>e.g., Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 125–126.&para;<br>Section 1692k(c)’s requirement that a debt collector maintain “proce&para;<br>dures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error” also more natu&para;<br>rally evokes procedures to avoid mistakes like clerical or factual er&para;<br>rors. Pp. 6–12.&para;<br>(b) Additional support for this reading is found in the statute’s con&para;<br>text and history. The FDCPA’s separate protection from liability for&para;<br>“any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any [FTC]&para;<br>advisory opinion,” §1692k(e), is more obviously tailored to the con&para;<br>cern at issue (excusing civil liability when the FDCPA’s prohibitions&para;<br>are uncertain) than the bona fide error defense. Moreover, in enact&para;<br>ing the FDCPA in 1977, Congress copied the pertinent portions of the&para;<br>bona fide error defense from the Truth in Lending Act (TILA),&para;<br>§1640(c). At that time, the three Federal Courts of Appeals to have&para;<br>considered the question interpreted the TILA provision as referring&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>to clerical errors, and there is no reason to suppose Congress dis&para;<br>agreed with those interpretations when it incorporated TILA’s lan&para;<br>guage into the FDCPA. Although in 1980 Congress amended the de&para;<br>fense in TILA, but not in the FDCPA, to exclude errors of legal&para;<br>judgment, it is not obvious that amendment changed the scope of the&para;<br>TILA defense in a way material here, given the prior uniform judicial&para;<br>interpretation of that provision. It is also unclear why Congress&para;<br>would have intended the FDCPA’s defense to be broader than TILA’s,&para;<br>and Congress has not expressly included mistakes of law in any of&para;<br>the parallel bona fide error defenses elsewhere in the U. S. Code.&para;<br>Carlisle’s reading is not supported by Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S.&para;<br>291, 292, which had no occasion to address the overall scope of the&para;<br>FDCPA bona fide error defense, and which did not depend on the&para;<br>premise that a misinterpretation of the requirements of the FDCPA&para;<br>would fall under that provision. Pp. 13–22.&para;<br>(c) Today’s decision does not place unmanageable burdens on debt&para;<br>collecting lawyers. The FDCPA contains several provisions expressly&para;<br>guarding against abusive lawsuits, and gives courts discretion in cal&para;<br>culating additional damages and attorney’s fees. Lawyers have re&para;<br>course to the bona fide error defense in §1692k(c) when a violation&para;<br>results from a qualifying factual error. To the extent the FDCPA im&para;<br>poses some constraints on a lawyer’s advocacy on behalf of a client, it&para;<br>is not unique; lawyers have a duty, for instance, to comply with the&para;<br>law and standards of professional conduct. Numerous state con&para;<br>sumer protection and debt collection statutes contain bona fide error&para;<br>defenses that are either silent as to, or expressly exclude, legal er&para;<br>rors. To the extent lawyers face liability for mistaken interpretations&para;<br>of the FDCPA, Carlisle and its amici have not shown that “the result&para;<br>[will be] so absurd as to warrant” disregarding the weight of textual&para;<br>authority. Heintz, supra, at 295. Absent such a showing, arguments&para;<br>that the FDCPA strikes an undesirable balance in assigning the risks&para;<br>of legal misinterpretation are properly addressed to Congress.&para;<br>Pp. 22–30.&para;<br>538 F. 3d 469, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

Section 813(c) of the&para;<br>Act, 15 U. S. C. §1692k(c), provides that a debt collector is&para;<br>not liable in an action brought under the Act if she can&para;<br>show “the violation was not intentional and resulted from&para;<br>a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of&para;<br>procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.”&para;<br>This case presents the question whether the “bona fide&para;<br>error” defense in §1692k(c) applies to a violation resulting&para;<br>from a debt collector’s mistaken interpretation of the legal&para;<br>requirements of the FDCPA. We conclude it does not.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress enacted the FDCPA in 1977, 91 Stat. 874, to&para;<br>eliminate abusive debt collection practices, to ensure that&para;<br>debt collectors who abstain from such practices are not&para;<br>competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent&para;<br>state action to protect consumers. 15 U. S. C. §1692(e).&para;<br>The Act regulates interactions between consumer debtors&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, &para;<br>&para;<br>KRAMER &amp; ULRICH LPA &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>and “debt collector[s],” defined to include any person who&para;<br>“regularly collects . . . debts owed or due or asserted to be&para;<br>owed or due another.” §§1692a(5), (6). Among other&para;<br>things, the Act prohibits debt collectors from making false&para;<br>representations as to a debt’s character, amount, or legal&para;<br>status, §1692e(2)(A); communicating with consumers at an&para;<br>“unusual time or place” likely to be inconvenient to the&para;<br>consumer, §1692c(a)(1); or using obscene or profane lan&para;<br>guage or violence or the threat thereof, §§1692d(1), (2).&para;<br>See generally §§1692b–1692j; Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S.&para;<br>291, 292–293 (1995).&para;<br>The Act is enforced through administrative action and&para;<br>private lawsuits. With some exceptions not relevant here,&para;<br>violations of the FDCPA are deemed to be unfair or decep&para;<br>tive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission&para;<br>Act (FTC Act), 15 U. S. C. §41 et seq., and are enforced by&para;<br>the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). See §1692l. As a&para;<br>result, a debt collector who acts with “actual knowledge or&para;<br>knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circum&para;<br>stances that such act is [prohibited under the FDCPA]” is&para;<br>subject to civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day.&para;<br>§§45(m)(1)(A), (C); 74 Fed. Reg. 858 (2009) (amending 16&para;<br>CFR §1.98(d)).&para;<br>The FDCPA also provides that “any debt collector who&para;<br>fails to comply with any provision of th[e] [Act] with re&para;<br>spect to any person is liable to such person.” 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1692k(a). Successful plaintiffs are entitled to “actual&para;<br>damage[s],” plus costs and “a reasonable attorney’s fee as&para;<br>determined by the court.” Ibid. A court may also award&para;<br>“additional damages,” subject to a statutory cap of $1,000&para;<br>for individual actions, or, for class actions, “the lesser of&para;<br>$500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the debt&para;<br>collector.” §1692k(a)(2). In awarding additional damages,&para;<br>the court must consider “the frequency and persistence of&para;<br>[the debt collector’s] noncompliance,” “the nature of such&para;<br>noncompliance,” and “the extent to which such noncompli&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ance was intentional.” §1692k(b).&para;<br>The Act contains two exceptions to provisions imposing&para;<br>liability on debt collectors. Section 1692k(c), at issue here,&para;<br>provides that&para;<br>“[a] debt collector may not be held liable in any action&para;<br>brought under [the FDCPA] if the debt collector shows&para;<br>by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was&para;<br>not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error&para;<br>notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures rea&para;<br>sonably adapted to avoid any such error.”&para;<br>The Act also states that none of its provisions imposing&para;<br>liability shall apply to “any act done or omitted in good&para;<br>faith in conformity with any advisory opinion of the [Fed&para;<br>eral Trade] Commission.” §1692k(e).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Respondents in this case are a law firm, Carlisle,&para;<br>McNellie, Rini, Kramer &amp; Ulrich, L. P. A., and one of its&para;<br>attorneys, Adrienne S. Foster (collectively Carlisle). In&para;<br>April 2006, Carlisle filed a complaint in Ohio state court&para;<br>on behalf of a client, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.&para;<br>Carlisle sought foreclosure of a mortgage held by Coun&para;<br>trywide in real property owned by petitioner Karen L.&para;<br>Jerman. The complaint included a “Notice,” later served&para;<br>on Jerman, stating that the mortgage debt would be as&para;<br>sumed to be valid unless Jerman disputed it in writing.&para;<br>Jerman’s lawyer sent a letter disputing the debt, and&para;<br>Carlisle sought verification from Countrywide. When&para;<br>Countrywide acknowledged that Jerman had, in fact,&para;<br>already paid the debt in full, Carlisle withdrew the fore&para;<br>closure lawsuit.&para;<br>Jerman then filed her own lawsuit seeking class certifi&para;<br>cation and damages under the FDCPA, contending that&para;<br>Carlisle violated §1692g by stating that her debt would be&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>JERMAN v.

Supp. 2d 720, 722–725 (ND Ohio 2006).2 The court&para;<br>ultimately granted summary judgment to Carlisle, how&para;<br>ever, concluding that §1692k(c) shielded it from liability&para;<br>because the violation was not intentional, resulted from a&para;<br>bona fide error, and occurred despite the maintenance of&para;<br>procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.&para;<br>502 F. Supp. 2d 686, 695–697 (ND Ohio 2007). The Court&para;<br>of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 538 F. 3d 469&para;<br>(2008). Acknowledging that the Courts of Appeals are&para;<br>divided regarding the scope of the bona fide error defense,&para;<br>and that the “majority view is that the defense is available&para;<br>for clerical and factual errors only,” the Sixth Circuit&para;<br>nonetheless held that §1692k(c) extends to “mistakes of&para;<br>law.” Id., at 473–476 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals found “nothing unusual” about&para;<br>attorney debt collectors maintaining “procedures” within&para;<br>the meaning of §1692k(c) to avoid mistakes of law. Id., at&para;<br>476. Noting that a parallel bona fide error defense in the&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Section 1692g(a)(3) requires a debt collector, within five days of an&para;<br>“initial communication” about the collection of a debt, to send the&para;<br>consumer a written notice containing, inter alia, “a statement that&para;<br>unless the consumer, within thirty days after receipt of the notice,&para;<br>disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be&para;<br>assumed to be valid by the debt collector.”&para;<br>2 The District Court distinguished, for instance, Graziano v. Harrison,&para;<br>950 F. 2d 107, 112 (CA3 1991), which held a consumer’s dispute of a&para;<br>debt under §1692g must be in writing to be effective. Noting that&para;<br>district courts within the Sixth Circuit had reached different results,&para;<br>and distinguishing one unpublished Sixth Circuit decision which&para;<br>Carlisle suggested approved a form with an in-writing requirement, the&para;<br>court adopted the reasoning from Camacho v. Bridgeport Financial,&para;<br>Inc., 430 F. 3d 1078, 1080–1082 (CA9 2005), and held that the plain&para;<br>language of §1692g does not impose an “in writing” requirement on&para;<br>consumers.

We likewise ex&para;<br>press no view about whether inclusion of an “in writing” requirement in&para;<br>a notice to a consumer violates §1692g, as that question was not pre&para;<br>sented in the petition for certiorari. Compare Graziano, supra, at 112&para;<br>(reading §1692g(a)(3) to require that “any dispute, to be effective, must&para;<br>be in writing”), with Camacho, supra, at 1082 (under §1692g(a)(3),&para;<br>“disputes need not be made in writing”).&para;<br>4 Compare, e.g., 538 F. 3d, at 476 (case below), with Baker v.

Riddle, 305 F. 3d 1107, 1121 (CA10 2002) (con&para;<br>cluding that §1692k(c) applies where a debt collector’s misinterpreta&para;<br>tion of a Utah dishonored check statute resulted in a violation of&para;<br>§1692f(1), which prohibits collection of any amount not “permitted by&para;<br>law”), with Picht v. Jon R.

The parties disagree about whether §1692k(c)&para;<br>applies when a violation results from a debt collector’s misinterpreta&para;<br>tion of the legal requirements of state law or federal law other than the&para;<br>FDCPA. Compare Brief for Petitioner 47–49, with Brief for Respon&para;<br>dents 60–62.

Jerman contends that when a debt&para;<br>collector intentionally commits the act giving rise to the&para;<br>violation (here, sending a notice that included the “in&para;<br>writing” language), a misunderstanding about what the&para;<br>Act requires cannot render the violation “not intentional,”&para;<br>given the general rule that mistake or ignorance of law is&para;<br>no defense. Carlisle and the dissent, in contrast, argue&para;<br>that nothing in the statutory text excludes legal errors&para;<br>from the category of “bona fide error[s]” covered by&para;<br>§1692k(c) and note that the Act refers not to an uninten&para;<br>tional “act” but rather an unintentional “violation.” The&para;<br>latter term, they contend, evinces Congress’ intent to&para;<br>impose liability only when a party knows its conduct is&para;<br>unlawful. Carlisle urges us, therefore, to read §1692k(c) to&para;<br>encompass “all types of error,” including mistakes of law.&para;<br>Brief for Respondents 7.&para;<br>We decline to adopt the expansive reading of §1692k(c)&para;<br>that Carlisle proposes.

In Kolstad v. American&para;<br>Dental Assn., 527 U.

The Court concluded that the shipment at issue, entered as&para;<br>“refined sugars,” was mislabeled under the prevailing meaning of that&para;<br>term and thus was subject to forfeiture “unless the [petitioner] c[ould]&para;<br>bring himself within the exceptio[n].” 7 Pet., at 409–410. As there had&para;<br>been no “accident” or “mistake” of fact, the “only mistake, if there ha[d]&para;<br>been any, [wa]s a mistake of law.” Id., at 410–411.

In that light, the statutory phrase is more natu&para;<br>rally read to apply to processes that have mechanical or&para;<br>other such “regular orderly” steps to avoid mistakes—for&para;<br>instance, the kind of internal controls a debt collector&para;<br>might adopt to ensure its employees do not communicate&para;<br>with consumers at the wrong time of day, §1692c(a)(1), or&para;<br>make false representations as to the amount of a debt,&para;<br>§1692e(2).

For this rea&para;<br>son, we find force in the suggestion by the Government (as&para;<br>amicus curiae supporting Jerman) that the broad statu&para;<br>tory requirement of procedures reasonably designed to&para;<br>avoid “any” bona fide error indicates that the relevant&para;<br>procedures are ones that help to avoid errors like clerical&para;<br>or factual mistakes. Such procedures are more likely to&para;<br>avoid error than those applicable to legal reasoning, par&para;<br>ticularly in the context of a comprehensive and complex&para;<br>federal statute such as the FDCPA that imposes open&para;<br>ended prohibitions on, inter alia, “false, deceptive,”&para;<br>§1692e, or “unfair” practices, §1692f.

But in that case, the Louisiana&para;<br>Supreme Court concluded only that a lender’s mistaken interpretation&para;<br>of state usury law did not “amoun[t] to an intentional violation of&para;<br>[TILA’s] disclosure requirements.” Id., at 161. The Louisiana court&para;<br>had no occasion to address the question analogous to the one we con&para;<br>sider today: whether TILA’s bona fide error defense extended to viola&para;<br>tions resulting from mistaken interpretation of TILA itself.

For one, it is not obvious that the amendment&para;<br>changed the scope of TILA’s bona fide error defense in a&para;<br>way material to our analysis, given the uniform interpre&para;<br>tations of three Courts of Appeals holding that the TILA&para;<br>defense does not extend to mistakes of law.12 (Contrary to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 Although&para;<br>&para;<br>again not necessary to our conclusion, evidence from the&para;<br>legislative record suggests some Members of Congress understood the&para;<br>amendment to “clarif[y]” the meaning of TILA’s bona fide error defense&para;<br>“to make clear that it applies to mechanical and computer errors,&para;<br>provided they are not the result of erroneous legal judgments as to the&para;<br>act’s requirements.” S. Rep. No. 96–73, pp. 7–8 (1979); see also Lock&para;<br>hart, 153 A. L. R. Fed. 211–212, §2[a] (1999) (amendment “was in&para;<br>tended merely to clarify what was then the prevailing view, that the&para;<br>bona fide error defense applies to clerical errors, not including errors of&para;<br>legal judgment”) (relying on S. Rep. No. 96–368, p. 32 (1979)).&para;<br>The concurring and dissenting opinions perceive an inconsistency&para;<br>between these references to clerical errors, as well as similar references&para;<br>in the pre-FDCPA precedents interpreting TILA, n. 10, supra, and&para;<br>reading the FDCPA’s bona fide error defense to include factual mis&para;<br>takes. Post, at 2–4, and n. 2 (opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 20&para;<br>(KENNEDY, J., dissenting). The quoted legislative history sources,&para;<br>however, while stating expressly that the TILA defense excludes legal&para;<br>errors, do not discuss a distinction between clerical and factual errors.&para;<br>Similarly, the cited cases interpreting TILA do not address a distinction&para;<br>between factual and clerical errors; rather, the courts were presented&para;<br>with claims that the defense applied to mistakes of law or other nonfac&para;<br>tual errors that the courts found not to be bona fide. See Ives, 522&para;<br>F. 2d, at 756–757; Haynes, 503 F. 2d, at 1166–1167; Palmer, 502 F. 2d,&para;<br>at 861. While factual mistakes might, in some circumstances, consti&para;<br>tute bona fide errors and give rise to violations that are “not inten&para;<br>tional” within the meaning of §1692k(c), we need not and do not decide&para;<br>today the precise distinction between clerical and factual errors, or&para;<br>what kinds of factual mistakes qualify under the FDCPA’s bona fide&para;<br>error defense. Cf. generally R. Hobbs, National Consumer Law Center,&para;<br>Fair Debt Collection §7.2 (6th ed. 2008 and Supp. 2009) (surveying case&para;<br>law on scope of §1692k(c)).&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, &para;<br>&para;<br>KRAMER &amp; ULRICH LPA &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>the dissent’s suggestion, post, at 21, this reading does not&para;<br>render the 1980 amendment surplusage. Congress may&para;<br>simply have intended to codify existing judicial interpreta&para;<br>tions to remove any potential for doubt in jurisdictions&para;<br>where courts had not yet addressed the issue.) It is also&para;<br>unclear why Congress would have intended the FDCPA’s&para;<br>defense to be broader than the one in TILA, which pre&para;<br>sents at least as significant a set of concerns about impos&para;<br>ing liability for uncertain legal obligations. See, e.g., Ford&para;<br>Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U. S. 555, 566 (1980)&para;<br>(TILA is “ ‘highly technical’ ”). Our reluctance to give&para;<br>controlling weight to the TILA amendment in construing&para;<br>the FDCPA is reinforced by the fact that Congress has not&para;<br>expressly included mistakes of law in any of the numerous&para;<br>bona fide error defenses, worded in pertinent part identi&para;<br>cally to §1692k(c), elsewhere in the U. S. Code. Compare,&para;<br>e.g., 12 U. S. C. §4010(c)(2) (bona fide error defense in&para;<br>Expedited Funds Availability Act expressly excluding “an&para;<br>error of legal judgment with respect to [obligations under&para;<br>that Act]”) with 15 U. S. C. §§1693m(c), 1693h(c) (bona&para;<br>fide error provisions in the Electronic Fund Transfer Act&para;<br>that are silent as to errors of legal judgment).13 Although&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 The Government observes that several federal agencies have con&para;<br>strued similar bona fide error defenses in statutes they administer to&para;<br>exclude errors of law. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28–&para;<br>30. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, for instance,&para;<br>has promulgated regulations specifying that the bona fide error defense&para;<br>in the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2607(d)(3), does not apply to “[a]n error of legal judgment,” 24 CFR&para;<br>§3500.15(b)(1)(ii) (2009). While administrative interpretations of other&para;<br>statutes do not control our reading of the FDCPA, we find it telling that&para;<br>no agency has adopted the view of the Court of Appeals. Of course,&para;<br>nothing in our opinion today addresses the validity of such regulations&para;<br>or the authority of agencies interpreting bona fide error provisions in&para;<br>other statutes to adopt a different reading. See National Cable &amp;&para;<br>Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967,&para;<br>982–983 (2005).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Carlisle points out that Congress has amended the&para;<br>FDCPA on several occasions without expressly restricting&para;<br>the scope of §1692k(c), that does not suggest Congress&para;<br>viewed the statute as having the expansive reading Car&para;<br>lisle advances, particularly as not until recently had a&para;<br>Court of Appeals interpreted the bona fide error defense to&para;<br>include a violation of the FDCPA resulting from a mistake&para;<br>of law. See Johnson v. Riddle, 305 F. 3d 1107, 1121–1124,&para;<br>and nn. 14–15 (CA10 2002).&para;<br>Carlisle’s reliance on Heintz, 514 U. S. 291, is also un&para;<br>availing. We held in that case that the FDCPA’s defini&para;<br>tion of “debt collector” includes lawyers who regularly,&para;<br>through litigation, attempt to collect consumer debts. Id.,&para;<br>at 292. We addressed a concern raised by the petitioner&para;<br>(as here, a lawyer collecting a debt on behalf of a client)&para;<br>that our reading would automatically render liable “any&para;<br>litigating lawyer who brought, and then lost, a claim&para;<br>against a debtor,” on the ground that §1692e(5) prohibits a&para;<br>debt collector from making any “ ‘threat to take action that&para;<br>cannot legally be taken.’ ” Id., at 295. We expressed skep&para;<br>ticism that §1692e(5) itself demanded such a result. But&para;<br>even assuming the correctness of petitioner’s reading of&para;<br>§1692e(5), we suggested that the availability of the bona&para;<br>fide error defense meant that the prospect of liability for&para;<br>litigating lawyers was not “so absurd” as to warrant im&para;<br>plying a categorical exemption unsupported by the statu&para;<br>tory text. Ibid. We had no occasion in Heintz to address&para;<br>the overall scope of the bona fide error defense. Our dis&para;<br>cussion of §1692e(5) did not depend on the premise that a&para;<br>misinterpretation of the requirements of the Act would fall&para;<br>under the bona fide error defense. In the mine-run law&para;<br>suit, a lawyer is at least as likely to be unsuccessful be&para;<br>cause of factual deficiencies as opposed to legal error.&para;<br>Lawyers can, of course, invoke §1692k(c) for violations&para;<br>resulting from qualifying factual errors.&para;<br>Carlisle’s remaining arguments do not change our view&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, &para;<br>&para;<br>KRAMER &amp; ULRICH LPA &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>of §1692k(c). Carlisle perceives an inconsistency between&para;<br>our reading of the term “intentional” in that provision and&para;<br>the instruction in §1692k(b) that a court look to whether&para;<br>“noncompliance was intentional” in assessing statutory&para;<br>additional damages. But assuming §1692k(b) encom&para;<br>passes errors of law, we see no conflict, only congruence, in&para;<br>reading the Act to permit a court to adjust statutory dam&para;<br>ages for a good-faith misinterpretation of law, even where&para;<br>a debt collector is not entitled to the categorical protection&para;<br>of the bona fide error defense. Carlisle is also concerned&para;<br>that under our reading, §1692k(c) would be unavailable to&para;<br>a debt collector who violates a provision of the FDCPA&para;<br>applying to acts taken with particular intent because in&para;<br>such instances the relevant act would not be uninten&para;<br>tional. See, e.g., §1692d(5) (prohibiting a debt collector&para;<br>from “[c]ausing a telephone to ring . . . continuously with&para;<br>intent to annoy, abuse, or harass”). Including mistakes as&para;<br>to the scope of such a prohibition, Carlisle urges, would&para;<br>ensure that §1692k(c) applied throughout the FDCPA. We&para;<br>see no reason, however, why the bona fide error defense&para;<br>must cover every provision of the Act.&para;<br>The parties and amici make arguments concerning the&para;<br>legislative history that we address for the sake of com&para;<br>pleteness. Carlisle points to a sentence in a Senate Com&para;<br>mittee Report stating that “[a] debt collector has no liabil&para;<br>ity . . . if he violates the act in any manner, including with&para;<br>regard to the act’s coverage, when such violation is unin&para;<br>tentional and occurred despite procedures designed to&para;<br>avoid such violations.” S. Rep. No. 95–382, p. 5 (1977); see&para;<br>also post, at 4–6 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (discussing report).&para;<br>But by its own terms, the quoted sentence does not unam&para;<br>biguously support Carlisle’s reading. Even if a bona fide&para;<br>mistake “with regard to the act’s coverage” could be read&para;<br>in isolation to contemplate a mistake of law, that reading&para;<br>does not exclude mistakes of fact. A mistake “with regard&para;<br>to the act’s coverage” may derive wholly from a debt collec&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tor’s factually mistaken belief, for example, that a particu&para;<br>lar debt arose out of a nonconsumer transaction and was&para;<br>therefore not “covered” by the Act. There is no reason to&para;<br>read this passing statement in the Senate Report as con&para;<br>templating an exemption for legal error that is the product&para;<br>of an attorney’s erroneous interpretation of the FDCPA—&para;<br>particularly when attorneys were excluded from the Act’s&para;<br>definition of “debt collector” until 1986. 100 Stat. 768.&para;<br>Moreover, the reference to “any manner” of violation is&para;<br>expressly qualified by the requirements that the violation&para;<br>be “unintentional” and occur despite maintenance of ap&para;<br>propriate procedures. In any event, we need not choose&para;<br>between these possible readings of the Senate Report, as&para;<br>the legislative record taken as a whole does not lend&para;<br>strong support to Carlisle’s view.14 We therefore decline to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>14 For&para;<br>&para;<br>instance, an amendment was proposed and rejected during the&para;<br>Senate Banking Committee’s consideration of the FDCPA that would&para;<br>have required proof that a debt collector’s violation was “knowin[g].”&para;<br>Senator Riegle, one of the Act’s primary sponsors, opposed the change,&para;<br>explaining that the bill reflected the view that “certain things ought not&para;<br>to happen, period. . . . [W]hether somebody does it knowingly, willfully,&para;<br>you know, with a good heart, bad heart, is really quite incidental.” See&para;<br>Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Markup&para;<br>Session: S. 1130—Debt Collection Legislation 60 (July 26, 1977) (here&para;<br>inafter Markup); see also ibid. (“We have left a way for these disputes&para;<br>to be adj[u]dicated if they are brought, where somebody can say, I&para;<br>didn’t know that, or my computer malfunctioned, something happened,&para;<br>I didn’t intend for the effect to be as it was”). To similar effect, a House&para;<br>Report on an earlier version of the bill explained the need for new&para;<br>legislation governing use of the mails for debt collection on grounds&para;<br>that existing statutes “frequently require[d]” a showing of “specific&para;<br>intent[,] which is difficult to prove.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–131, p. 3 (1977).&para;<br>Elsewhere, to be sure, the legislative record contains statements more&para;<br>supportive of Carlisle’s interpretation. In particular, a concern was&para;<br>raised in the July 26 markup session that the TILA bona fide error&para;<br>defense had been interpreted “as only protecting against a mathemati&para;<br>cal error,” and that the FDCPA defense should “go beyond” TILA to&para;<br>“allow the courts discretion to dismiss a violation where it was a&para;<br>technical error.” Markup 20. In response, a staffer explained that the&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, &para;<br>&para;<br>KRAMER &amp; ULRICH LPA &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>give controlling weight to this isolated passage.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Carlisle, its amici, and the dissent raise the additional&para;<br>concern that our reading will have unworkable practical&para;<br>consequences for debt collecting lawyers. See, e.g., Brief&para;<br>for Respondents 40–41, 45–48; NARCA Brief 4–16; post, at&para;<br>5–14. Carlisle claims the FDCPA’s private enforcement&para;<br>provisions have fostered a “cottage industry” of profes&para;<br>sional plaintiffs who sue debt collectors for trivial viola&para;<br>tions of the Act. See Brief for Respondents 40–41. If debt&para;<br>collecting attorneys can be held personally liable for their&para;<br>reasonable misinterpretations of the requirements of the&para;<br>Act, Carlisle and its amici foresee a flood of lawsuits&para;<br>against creditors’ lawyers by plaintiffs (and their attor&para;<br>neys) seeking damages and attorney’s fees. The threat of&para;<br>such liability, in the dissent’s view, creates an irreconcil&para;<br>able conflict between an attorney’s personal financial&para;<br>interest and her ethical obligation of zealous advocacy on&para;<br>behalf of a client: An attorney uncertain about what the&para;<br>FDCPA requires must choose between, on the one hand,&para;<br>exposing herself to liability and, on the other, resolving&para;<br>the legal ambiguity against her client’s interest or advis&para;<br>ing the client to settle—even where there is substantial&para;<br>legal authority for a position favoring the client. Post, at&para;<br>10–14.15&para;<br>——————&para;<br>FDCPA defense would “apply to any violation of the act which was&para;<br>unintentional,” and answered affirmatively when the Chairman asked:&para;<br>“So it’s not simply a mathematical error but any bona fide error without&para;<br>intent?” Id., at 21. Whatever the precise balance of these statements&para;<br>may be, we can conclude that this equivocal evidence from legislative&para;<br>history does not displace the clear textual and contextual authority&para;<br>discussed above.&para;<br>15 The dissent also cites several other consumer-protection statutes,&para;<br>such as TILA and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U. S. C. §1681 et&para;<br>seq., which in its view create “incentives to file lawsuits even where no&para;<br>actual harm has occurred” and are illustrative of what the dissent&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We do not believe our holding today portends such grave&para;<br>consequences. For one, the FDCPA contains several pro&para;<br>visions that expressly guard against abusive lawsuits,&para;<br>thereby mitigating the financial risk to creditors’ attor&para;<br>neys. When an alleged violation is trivial, the “actual&para;<br>damage[s]” sustained, §1692k(a)(1), will likely be de&para;<br>minimis or even zero. The Act sets a cap on “additional”&para;<br>damages, §1692k(a)(2), and vests courts with discretion to&para;<br>adjust such damages where a violation is based on a good&para;<br>faith error, §1692k(b). One amicus suggests that attor&para;<br>ney’s fees may shape financial incentives even where&para;<br>actual and statutory damages are modest. NARCA Brief&para;<br>11. The statute does contemplate an award of costs and “a&para;<br>reasonable attorney’s fee as determined by the court” in&para;<br>the case of “any successful action to enforce the foregoing&para;<br>liability.” §1692k(a)(3). But courts have discretion in&para;<br>calculating reasonable attorney’s fees under this statute,16&para;<br>——————&para;<br>perceives to be a “troubling dynamic of allowing certain actors in the&para;<br>system to spin even good-faith, technical violations of federal law into&para;<br>lucrative litigation.” Post, at 5–6. The dissent’s concern is primarily&para;<br>with Congress’ policy choice, embodied in statutory text, to authorize&para;<br>private rights of action and recovery of attorney’s fees, costs, and in&para;<br>some cases, both actual and statutory damages. As noted, in one of the&para;<br>statutes the dissent cites, Congress explicitly barred reliance on a&para;<br>mistake-of-law defense notwithstanding the “highly technical” nature of&para;<br>the scheme. See 15 U. S. C. §1640(c) (TILA); Ford Motor Credit Co. v.&para;<br>Milhollin, 444 U. S. 555, 566 (1980). Similarly, the plain text of the&para;<br>FDCPA authorizes a private plaintiff to recover not only “actual dam&para;<br>age[s]” for harm suffered but also “such additional damages as the&para;<br>court may allow,” §1692k(a).&para;<br>16 The Courts of Appeals generally review a District Court’s calcula&para;<br>tion of an attorney fee award under §1692k for abuse of discretion. See,&para;<br>e.g., Carroll v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, 53 F. 3d 626, 628–629 (CA4 1995);&para;<br>Emanuel v. American Credit Exchange, 870 F. 2d 805, 809 (CA2 1989).&para;<br>Many District Courts apply a lodestar method, permitting downward&para;<br>adjustments in appropriate circumstances. See, e.g., Schlacher v. Law&para;<br>Offices of Phillip J. Rotche &amp; Assoc., P. C., 574 F. 3d 852 (CA7 2009)&para;<br>(relying on Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424 (1983)); Ferland v.&para;<br>Conrad Credit Corp., 244 F. 3d 1145, 1148–1151, and n. 4 (CA9 2001)&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, &para;<br>&para;<br>KRAMER &amp; ULRICH LPA &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>and §1692k(a)(3) authorizes courts to award attorney’s&para;<br>fees to the defendant if a plaintiff’s suit “was brought in&para;<br>bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.”&para;<br>Lawyers also have recourse to the affirmative defense in&para;<br>§1692k(c). Not every uncertainty presented in litigation&para;<br>stems from interpretation of the requirements of the Act&para;<br>itself; lawyers may invoke the bona fide error defense, for&para;<br>instance, where a violation results from a qualifying fac&para;<br>tual error. Jerman and the Government suggest that&para;<br>lawyers can entirely avoid the risk of misinterpreting the&para;<br>Act by obtaining an advisory opinion from the FTC under&para;<br>§1692k(e). Carlisle fairly observes that the FTC has not&para;<br>frequently issued such opinions, and that the average&para;<br>processing time may present practical difficulties. Indeed,&para;<br>the Government informed us at oral argument that the&para;<br>FTC has issued only four opinions in the past decade (in&para;<br>response to seven requests), and the FTC’s response time&para;<br>——————&para;<br>(per curiam); see generally Hobbs, Fair Debt Collection §6.8.6. In&para;<br>Schlacher, for instance, the court affirmed a downward adjustment for&para;<br>the “unnecessary use of multiple attorneys . . . in a straightforward,&para;<br>short-lived [FDCPA] case.” 574 F. 3d, at 854–855. In Carroll, the court&para;<br>found no abuse of discretion in a District Court’s award of a $500&para;<br>attorney’s fee, rather than the lodestar amount, where the lawsuit had&para;<br>recovered only $50 in damages for “at most a technical violation” of the&para;<br>FDCPA. 53 F. 3d, at 629–631.&para;<br>Lower courts have taken different views about when, and whether,&para;<br>§1692k requires an award of attorney’s fees. Compare Tolentino v.&para;<br>Friedman, 46 F. 3d 645 (CA7 1995) (award of fees to a successful&para;<br>plaintiff “mandatory”), and Emanuel, supra, at 808–809 (same, even&para;<br>where the plaintiff suffered no actual damages), with Graziano, 950 F.&para;<br>2d, at 114, and n. 13 (attorney’s fees may be denied for plaintiff’s “bad&para;<br>faith conduct”), and Johnson v. Eaton, 80 F. 3d 148, 150–152 (CA5&para;<br>1996) (“attorney’s fees . . . are only available [under §1692k] where the&para;<br>plaintiff has succeeded in establishing that the defendant is liable for&para;<br>actual and/or additional damages”; this reading “will deter suits&para;<br>brought only as a means of generating attorney’s fees”). We need not&para;<br>resolve these issues today to express doubt that our reading&para;<br>of §1692k(c) will impose unmanageable burdens on debt collecting&para;<br>lawyers.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Without disregarding the possibility that the&para;<br>FTC advisory opinion process might be useful in some&para;<br>cases, evidence of present administrative practice makes&para;<br>us reluctant to place significant weight on §1692k(e) as a&para;<br>practical remedy for the concerns Carlisle has identified.&para;<br>We are unpersuaded by what seems an implicit premise&para;<br>of Carlisle’s arguments: that the bona fide error defense is&para;<br>a debt collector’s sole recourse to avoid potential liability.&para;<br>We addressed a similar argument in Heintz, in which the&para;<br>petitioner urged that certain of the Act’s substantive&para;<br>provisions would generate “ ‘anomalies’ ” if the term “debt&para;<br>collector” was read to include litigating lawyers. 514&para;<br>U. S., at 295. Among other things, the petitioner in Heintz&para;<br>contended that §1692c(c)’s bar on further communication&para;<br>with a consumer who notifies a debt collector that she is&para;<br>refusing to pay the debt would prohibit a lawyer from&para;<br>filing a lawsuit to collect the debt. Id., at 296–297. We&para;<br>agreed it would be “odd” if the Act interfered in this way&para;<br>with “an ordinary debt-collecting lawsuit” but suggested&para;<br>§1692c(c) did not demand such a reading in light of several&para;<br>exceptions in the text of that provision itself. Ibid. As in&para;<br>Heintz, we need not authoritatively interpret the Act’s&para;<br>conduct-regulating provisions to observe that those provi&para;<br>sions should not be assumed to compel absurd results&para;<br>when applied to debt collecting attorneys.&para;<br>To the extent the FDCPA imposes some constraints on a&para;<br>lawyer’s advocacy on behalf of a client, it is hardly unique&para;<br>in our law. “[A]n attorney’s ethical duty to advance the&para;<br>interests of his client is limited by an equally solemn duty&para;<br>to comply with the law and standards of professional&para;<br>conduct.” Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U.

Attorneys are not the only ones who would have&para;<br>been able to claim a legal-error defense; non-attorneys&para;<br>make legal mistakes too.

See ante, at 1–2.&para;<br>The statute permits private suits against debt collectors&para;<br>who violate its provisions. §1692k(a). An exception&para;<br>to liability is provided by the so-called bona fide error&para;<br>defense:&para;<br>“A debt collector may not be held liable in any action&para;<br>. . . if the debt collector shows by a preponderance of&para;<br>evidence that the violation was not intentional and&para;<br>resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the&para;<br>maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to&para;<br>avoid any such error.” §1692k(c).&para;<br>This language does not exclude mistakes of law and is&para;<br>most naturally read to include them. Certainly a mis&para;<br>taken belief about the law is, if held in good faith, a “bona&para;<br>fide error” as that phrase is normally understood. See&para;<br>Black’s Law Dictionary 582 (8th ed. 2004) (defining “error”&para;<br>as “a belief that what is false is true or that what is true is&para;<br>false,” def. 1); ibid. (“[a] mistake of law or of fact in a&para;<br>tribunal’s judgment, opinion, or order,” def. 2); ibid. (list&para;<br>ing categories of legal errors).&para;<br>The choice of words provides further reinforcement for&para;<br>this view. The bona fide error exception in §1692k(c)&para;<br>applies if “the violation was not intentional and resulted&para;<br>from a bona fide error.” The term “violation” specifically&para;<br>denotes a legal infraction. See id., at 1600 (“An infraction&para;<br>or breach of the law; a transgression,” def. 1). The statu&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tory term “violation” thus stands in direct contrast to&para;<br>other provisions of the FDCPA that describe conduct itself.&para;<br>This applies both to specific terms, e.g., §1692e (“A debt&para;<br>collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading&para;<br>representation or means in connection with the collection&para;<br>of any debt”), and to more general ones, e.g., §1692k(e)&para;<br>(referring to “any act done or omitted in good faith”). By&para;<br>linking the mens rea requirement (“not intentional”) with&para;<br>the word “violation”—rather than with the conduct giving&para;<br>rise to the violation—the Act by its terms indicates that&para;<br>the bona fide error exception applies to legal errors as well&para;<br>as to factual ones.&para;<br>The Court’s precedents accord with this interpretation.&para;<br>Federal statutes that link the term “violation” with a mens&para;<br>rea requirement have been interpreted to excuse good&para;<br>faith legal mistakes. See, e.g., McLaughlin v. Richland&para;<br>Shoe Co., 486 U. S. 128, 129, 133 (1988) (the phrase “aris&para;<br>ing out of a willful violation” in the Fair Labor Standards&para;<br>Act applies where an employer “either knew or showed&para;<br>reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct&para;<br>was prohibited by the statute”); Trans World Airlines, Inc.&para;<br>v. Thurston, 469 U.

The FDCPA’s use of “violation” thus distin&para;<br>guishes it from most of the authorities relied upon by the&para;<br>Court to demonstrate that mistake-of-law defenses are&para;<br>disfavored. See, e.g., ante, at 7–8 (citing Kolstad v. Ameri&para;<br>can Dental Assn., 527 U. S. 526 (1999)).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, &para;<br>&para;<br>KRAMER &amp; ULRICH LPA &para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>The Court’s response is that there is something distinc&para;<br>tive about the word “willful” that suggests an excuse for&para;<br>mistakes of law. This may well be true for criminal stat&para;<br>utes, in which the terms “ ‘knowing,’ ‘intentional’ [and]&para;<br>‘willful’ ” have been distinguished in this regard. Ante, at&para;<br>10 (citing Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47,&para;<br>57 (2007)). But this distinction is specific to the criminal&para;<br>context:&para;<br>“It is different in the criminal law. When the term&para;<br>‘willful’ or ‘willfully’ has been used in a criminal stat&para;<br>ute, we have regularly read the modifier as limiting&para;<br>liability to knowing violations. This reading of the&para;<br>term, however, is tailored to the criminal law, where&para;<br>it is characteristically used to require a criminal in&para;<br>tent beyond the purpose otherwise required for guilt,&para;<br>or an additional ‘bad purpose,’ or specific intent to vio&para;<br>late a known legal duty created by highly technical&para;<br>statutes.” Id., at 57–58, n. 9 (citations omitted).&para;<br>For this reason, the Court’s citation to criminal cases,&para;<br>which are themselves inconsistent, see Ratzlaf v. United&para;<br>States, 510 U. S. 135 (1994), is unavailing. See ante, at&para;<br>10–11, and n. 7.&para;<br>In the civil context, by contrast, the word “willful” has&para;<br>been used to impose a mens rea threshold for liability that&para;<br>is lower, not higher, than an intentionality requirement.&para;<br>See Safeco, supra, at 57 (“[W]here willfulness is a statu&para;<br>tory condition of civil liability, we have generally taken it&para;<br>to cover not only knowing violations of a standard, but&para;<br>reckless ones as well”). Avoiding liability under a statute&para;<br>aimed at intentional violations should therefore be easier,&para;<br>not harder, than avoiding liability under a statute aimed&para;<br>at willful violations. And certainly there is nothing in&para;<br>Thurston or McLaughlin—both civil cases—suggesting&para;<br>that they would have come out differently had the rele&para;<br>vant statutes used “intentional violation” rather than&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“willful violation.”&para;<br>B&para;<br>These considerations suffice to show that §1692k(c) is&para;<br>most reasonably read to include mistakes of law. Even if&para;<br>this were merely a permissible reading, however, it should&para;<br>be adopted to avoid the adverse consequences that must&para;<br>flow from the Court’s contrary decision. The Court’s read&para;<br>ing leads to results Congress could not have intended.&para;<br>1&para;<br>The FDCPA is but one of many federal laws that Con&para;<br>gress has enacted to protect consumers. A number of&para;<br>these statutes authorize the filing of private suits against&para;<br>those who use unfair or improper practices. See, e.g., 15&para;<br>U. S. C. §1692k (FDCPA); §1640 (Truth in Lending Act);&para;<br>§1681n (Fair Credit Reporting Act); 49 U. S. C. §32710&para;<br>(Federal Odometer Disclosure Act); 11 U. S. C. §526(c)(2)&para;<br>(Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection&para;<br>Act of 2005). Several of these provisions permit a success&para;<br>ful plaintiff to recover—in addition to actual damages—&para;<br>statutory damages, attorney’s fees and costs, and in some&para;<br>cases punitive damages. E.g., 15 U. S. C. §1640(a)(2)&para;<br>(statutory damages); §1640(a)(3) (attorney’s fees and&para;<br>costs); §1681n(a)(1)(B) (statutory and punitive damages);&para;<br>§1681n(a)(1)(B)(3) (costs and attorney’s fees); 49 U. S. C.&para;<br>§32710(a) (“3 times the actual damages or $1,500, which&para;<br>ever is greater”); §32710(b) (costs and attorney’s fees); 11&para;<br>U. S. C. §526(c)(3)(A) (costs and attorney’s fees). Some&para;<br>also explicitly permit class-action suits. E.g., 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1640(a)(2)(B); §1692k(a)(2)(B).&para;<br>A collateral effect of these statutes may be to create&para;<br>incentives to file lawsuits even where no actual harm has&para;<br>occurred. This happens when the plaintiff can recover&para;<br>statutory damages for the violation and his or her attorney&para;<br>will receive fees if the suit is successful, no matter how&para;<br>slight the injury. A favorable verdict after trial is not&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, &para;<br>&para;<br>KRAMER &amp; ULRICH LPA &para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>necessarily the goal; often the plaintiff will be just as&para;<br>happy with a settlement, as will his or her attorney (who&para;<br>will receive fees regardless). The defendant, meanwhile,&para;<br>may conclude a quick settlement is preferable to the costs&para;<br>of discovery and a protracted trial. And if the suit attains&para;<br>class-action status, the financial stakes rise in magnitude.&para;<br>See, e.g., §1640(a)(2)(B) (class-action recovery of up to “the&para;<br>lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the&para;<br>[defendant]”); §1692k(a)(2)(B) (same).&para;<br>The present case offers an object lesson. Respondents&para;<br>filed a complaint in state court on behalf of a client that&para;<br>mistakenly believed Jerman owed money to it. Jerman’s&para;<br>attorney then informed respondents that the debt had&para;<br>been paid in full. Respondents confirmed this fact with&para;<br>the client and withdrew the lawsuit.&para;<br>This might have been the end of the story. But because&para;<br>respondents had informed Jerman that she was required&para;<br>to dispute the debt in writing, she filed a class-action&para;<br>complaint. It did not matter that Jerman had claimed no&para;<br>harm as a result of respondents’ actions. Jerman sued for&para;<br>damages, attorney’s fees, and costs—including class dam&para;<br>ages of “$500,000 or 1% of defendants’ net worth which&para;<br>ever is less.” Amended Complaint in No. 1:06–CV–01397&para;<br>(ND Ohio), p. 4. In addition to merits-related discovery,&para;<br>Jerman sought information from respondents concerning&para;<br>the income and net worth of each partner in the firm. At&para;<br>some point, Jerman proposed to settle with respondents&para;<br>for $15,000 in damages and $7,500 in attorney’s fees.&para;<br>Amended Joint App. in No. 07–3964 (CA6), pp. 256–262.&para;<br>The case illustrates how a technical violation of a complex&para;<br>federal statute can give rise to costly litigation with incen&para;<br>tives to settle simply to avoid attorney’s fees.&para;<br>Today’s holding gives new impetus to this already trou&para;<br>bling dynamic of allowing certain actors in the system to&para;<br>spin even good-faith, technical violations of federal law&para;<br>into lucrative litigation, if not for themselves then for the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>attorneys who conceive of the suit. See Federal Home&para;<br>Loan Mortgage Corp. v. Lamar, 503 F. 3d 504, 513 (CA6&para;<br>2007) (referring to the “cottage industry” of litigation that&para;<br>has arisen out of the FDCPA (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted)). It is clear that Congress, too, was troubled by&para;<br>this dynamic. That is precisely why it enacted a bona fide&para;<br>error defense. The Court’s ruling, however, endorses and&para;<br>drives forward this dynamic, for today’s holding leaves&para;<br>attorneys and their clients vulnerable to civil liability for&para;<br>adopting good-faith legal positions later determined to be&para;<br>mistaken, even if reasonable efforts were made to avoid&para;<br>mistakes.&para;<br>The Court seeks to brush aside these concerns by noting&para;<br>that trivial violations will give rise to little in the way of&para;<br>actual damages and that trial courts “have discretion in&para;<br>calculating reasonable attorney’s fees under [the] statute.”&para;<br>Ante, at 23. It is not clear, however, that a court is per&para;<br>mitted to adjust a fee award based on its assessment of&para;<br>the suit’s utility. Cf. Perdue v. Kenny A., post, at 9 (noting&para;<br>a “ ‘strong presumption’ ” of reasonableness that attaches&para;<br>to a lodestar calculation of attorney’s fees). Though the&para;<br>Court, properly, does not address the question here, it&para;<br>acknowledges that some courts have deemed fee awards to&para;<br>victorious plaintiffs to be “ ‘mandatory,’ ” even if the plain&para;<br>tiff suffered no damage. Ante, at 23–24, n. 16.&para;<br>The Court’s second response is that the FDCPA guards&para;<br>against abusive suits and that suits brought “ ‘in bad faith&para;<br>and for the purpose of harassment’ ” can lead to a fee&para;<br>award for the defendant.&para;<br>Ante, at 24 (quoting&para;<br>§1692k(a)(3)). Yet these safeguards cannot deter suits&para;<br>based on technical—but harmless—violations of the stat&para;<br>ute. If the plaintiff obtains a favorable judgment or a&para;<br>settlement, then by definition the suit will not have been&para;<br>brought in bad faith. See Emanuel v. American Credit&para;<br>Exch., 870 F. 2d 805, 809 (CA2 1989) (FDCPA defendant’s&para;<br>“claim for malicious prosecution cannot succeed unless the&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>JERMAN v.

Jerman brought&para;<br>suit without pointing to any actual harm that resulted&para;<br>from respondents’ actions. At the time her complaint was&para;<br>filed, it was an open question in the Sixth Circuit whether&para;<br>a debt collector could demand that a debt be disputed in&para;<br>writing, and the district courts in the Circuit had reached&para;<br>different answers. Ante, at 4, n. 2. The trial court in this&para;<br>case happened to side with Jerman on the issue, 464&para;<br>F. Supp. 2d 720, 722–725 (ND Ohio 2006), but it seems&para;<br>unlikely that the court would have labeled her suit “abu&para;<br>sive” or “in bad faith” even if it had gone the other way.&para;<br>There is no good basis for optimism, then, when one&para;<br>contemplates the practical consequences of today’s deci&para;<br>sion. Given the complexity of the FDCPA regime, see 16&para;<br>CFR pt. 901 (2009) (FDCPA regulations), technical viola&para;<br>tions are likely to be common. Indeed, the Court acknowl&para;<br>edges that they are inevitable. See ante, at 12. As long as&para;<br>legal mistakes occur, plaintiffs and their attorneys will&para;<br>have an incentive to bring suits for these infractions. It&para;<br>seems unlikely that Congress sought to create a system&para;<br>that encourages costly and time-consuming litigation over&para;<br>harmless violations committed in good faith despite rea&para;<br>sonable safeguards.&para;<br>When construing a federal statute, courts should be&para;<br>mindful of the effect of the interpretation on congressional&para;<br>purposes explicit in the statutory text. The FDCPA states&para;<br>an objective that today’s decision frustrates. The statu&para;<br>tory purpose was to “eliminate abusive debt collection&para;<br>practices” and to ensure that debt collectors who refrain&para;<br>from using those practices “are not competitively disad&para;<br>vantaged.” 15 U. S. C. §1692(e) (“Purposes”). The prac&para;<br>tices Congress addressed involved misconduct that is&para;<br>deliberate, see §1692(a) (“abusive, deceptive, and unfair&para;<br>debt collection practices”); §1692(c) (“misrepresentation or&para;<br>other abusive debt collection practices”), or unreasonable,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>see §1692c(a)(1) (prohibiting debt collectors from commu&para;<br>nicating with debtors at times “which should be known” to&para;<br>be inconvenient); §1692e(8) (prohibiting the communica&para;<br>tion of credit card information “which should be known to&para;<br>be false”). That explains the statutory objective not to&para;<br>disadvantage debt collectors who “refrain” from abusive&para;<br>practices—that is to say, debt collectors who do not inten&para;<br>tionally or unreasonably adopt them. It further explains&para;<br>why Congress included a good-faith error exception,&para;<br>which exempts violations that are not intentional or&para;<br>unreasonable.&para;<br>In referring to “abusive debt collection practices,” how&para;<br>ever, surely Congress did not contemplate attorneys who&para;<br>act based on reasonable, albeit ultimately mistaken, legal&para;<br>interpretations. A debt collector does not gain a competi&para;<br>tive advantage by making good-faith legal errors any more&para;<br>than by making good-faith factual errors. This is ex&para;<br>pressly so if the debt collector has implemented “proce&para;<br>dures reasonably adapted to avoid” them. By reading&para;<br>§1692k(c) to exclude good-faith mistakes of law, the Court&para;<br>fails to align its interpretation with the statutory&para;<br>objectives.&para;<br>The Court urges, nevertheless, that there are policy&para;<br>concerns on the other side. The Court frets about debt&para;<br>collectors who “press the boundaries of the Act’s prohibi&para;<br>tions” and about a potential “ ‘race to the bottom.’ ” Ante,&para;<br>at 27–28 (quoting Brief for Petitioner 32). For instance, in&para;<br>its view, interpreting §1692k(c) to encompass legal mis&para;<br>takes might mean that “nonlawyer debt collectors could&para;<br>obtain blanket immunity for mistaken interpretations of&para;<br>the FDCPA simply by seeking the advice of legal counsel.”&para;<br>Ante, at 27. It must be remembered, however, that&para;<br>§1692k(c) may only be invoked where the debt collector’s&para;<br>error is “bona fide” and where “reasonable procedures”&para;<br>have been adopted to avoid errors. There is no valid or&para;<br>persuasive reason to assume that Congress would want to&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, &para;<br>&para;<br>KRAMER &amp; ULRICH LPA &para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>impose liability on a debt collector who relies in good faith&para;<br>on the reasonable advice of counsel. If anything, we&para;<br>should expect Congress to think that such behavior should&para;<br>be encouraged, not discouraged.&para;<br>The Court also suggests that reading §1692k(c) to in&para;<br>clude legal errors would encourage litigation over a num&para;<br>ber of issues: what subjective intent is necessary for liabil&para;<br>ity; what procedures are necessary to avoid legal mistakes;&para;<br>what standard applies to procedures adopted by attorney&para;<br>debt collectors as compared to non-attorney debt collec&para;<br>tors. Yet these questions are no different from ones al&para;<br>ready raised by the statute. Whether the debt collector is&para;<br>an attorney or not, his or her subjective intent must be&para;<br>assessed before liability can be determined. Procedures to&para;<br>avoid mistakes—whether legal or otherwise—must be&para;<br>“reasonable,” which is always a context-specific inquiry.&para;<br>The Court provides no reason to think that legal errors&para;<br>raise concerns that differ in these respects from those&para;<br>raised by non-legal errors.&para;<br>2&para;<br>There is a further and most serious reason to interpret&para;<br>§1692k(c) to include good-faith legal mistakes. In Heintz&para;<br>v. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291 (1995), the Court held that at&para;<br>torneys engaged in debt-collection litigation may be “debt&para;<br>collectors” for purposes of the FDCPA. In reaching this&para;<br>conclusion the Court confronted the allegation that its&para;<br>interpretation would produce the anomalous result that&para;<br>attorneys could be liable for bringing legal claims against&para;<br>debtors if those claims ultimately proved unsuccessful.&para;<br>Id., at 295. The Court rejected this argument. In doing so&para;<br>it said that §1692k(c) provides debt collectors with a de&para;<br>fense for their bona fide errors. Id., at 295.&para;<br>Today the Court relies on Heintz to allay concerns about&para;<br>the practical implications of its decision. Ante, at 25.

When statutory provisions have not&para;<br>yet been interpreted in a definitive way, principled advo&para;<br>cacy is to be prized, not punished. Surely this includes&para;<br>offering interpretations of a statute that are permissible,&para;<br>even if not yet settled. The FDCPA is a complex statute,&para;<br>and its provisions are subject to different interpretations.&para;<br>See, e.g., ante, at 5, n. 4 (identifying splits of authority on&para;<br>two different FDCPA issues); Brief for National Associa&para;<br>tion of Retail Collection Attorneys as Amicus Curiae 5–6&para;<br>(identifying another split); see also ante, at 12. Attorneys&para;<br>will often find themselves confronted with a statutory&para;<br>provision that is susceptible to different but still reason&para;<br>able interpretations.&para;<br>An attorney’s obligation in the face of uncertainty is to&para;<br>give the client his or her best professional assessment of&para;<br>the law’s mandate. Under the Court’s interpretation of&para;<br>the FDCPA, however, even that might leave the attorney&para;<br>vulnerable to suit.

When respondents filed a foreclosure complaint&para;<br>against Jerman on behalf of their client, they had no&para;<br>reason to doubt that the debt was valid.

This distorts the legal process.&para;<br>Henceforth, creditors’ attorneys of the highest ethical&para;<br>standing are encouraged to adopt a debtor-friendly inter&para;<br>pretation of every question, lest the attorneys themselves&para;<br>incur personal financial risk. It is most disturbing that&para;<br>this Court now adopts a statutory interpretation that will&para;<br>interject an attorney’s personal financial interests into the&para;<br>professional and ethical dynamics of the attorney-client&para;<br>relationship.

Ante, at 25–26.&para;<br>This response only underscores the problem with the&para;<br>Court’s approach.

Here respondents’ law&para;<br>firm did not harass Jerman; it did not file a frivolous suit&para;<br>against her; it did not intentionally mislead her; it caused&para;<br>her no damages or injury. The firm acted upon a reason&para;<br>able legal interpretation that the District Court later&para;<br>thought to be mistaken.

If the law firm can be pun&para;<br>ished for making a good-faith legal error, then to be safe&para;<br>an attorney must always stick to the most debtor-friendly&para;<br>interpretation of the statute, lest automatic liability follow&para;<br>if some later decision adopts a different rule. This dy&para;<br>namic creates serious concerns, not only for the attorney&para;<br>client relationship but also for First Amendment rights.&para;<br>Cf. Legal Services Corporation v.

We need not decide that these concerns rise to&para;<br>the level of an independent constitutional violation, see&para;<br>ante, at 29, n. 21, to recognize that they counsel against a&para;<br>problematic interpretation of the statute.

Lawyers in practice would not consider this alterna&para;<br>tive at all realistic, particularly where the defense is&para;<br>needed most.&para;<br>And even were there time to generate a formal request&para;<br>to the FTC and wait an average of three or four months for&para;<br>a response (assuming the FTC responds at all), the argu&para;<br>ment assumes that an ambiguity in the statute is obvious,&para;<br>not latent, that the problem is at once apparent, and that&para;<br>a conscious decision to invoke FTC procedures can be&para;<br>made. But the problem in many instances is that inter&para;<br>pretive alternatives are not at once apparent. All this may&para;<br>explain why, in the past decade, the FTC has issued only&para;<br>four opinions in response to just seven requests. See Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 27–28, 30. The FTC advisory process does not&para;<br>remedy the difficulties that the Court’s opinion will cause.&para;<br>Even if an FTC opinion is obtained, moreover, the ethi&para;<br>cal dilemma of counsel is not resolved. If the FTC adopts&para;<br>a position unfavorable to the client, the attorney may still&para;<br>believe the FTC is mistaken.

This alters the ethical balance central to the&para;<br>adversary system; and it is, again, a reason for the Court&para;<br>to adopt a different, but still reasonable, interpretation to&para;<br>avoid systemic disruption.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Court does not assert that its interpretation is&para;<br>clearly commanded by the text. Instead, its decision relies&para;<br>on an amalgam of arguments that, taken together, are&para;<br>said to establish the superiority of its preferred reading.&para;<br>This does not withstand scrutiny.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>First, the Court relies on the maxim that “ ‘ignorance of&para;<br>the law will not excuse any person, either civilly or crimi&para;<br>nally.’ ” Ante, at 6 (quoting Barlow v. United States, 7 Pet.&para;<br>404, 411 (1833)). There is no doubt that this principle “is&para;<br>deeply rooted in the American legal system.” Cheek v.&para;<br>United States, 498 U. S. 192, 199 (1991). Yet it is unhelp&para;<br>ful to the Court’s position. The maxim the Court cites is&para;<br>based on the premise “that the law is definite and know&para;<br>able,” so that all must be deemed to know its mandate.&para;<br>Ibid. See also O. Holmes, The Common Law 48 (1881)&para;<br>(“[T]o admit the excuse [of ignorance] at all would be to&para;<br>encourage ignorance where the law-maker has determined&para;<br>to make men know and obey”). In other words, citizens&para;<br>cannot avoid compliance with the law simply by demon&para;<br>strating a failure to learn it.&para;<br>The most straightforward application of this principle is&para;<br>to statutory provisions that delineate a category of prohib&para;<br>ited conduct. These statutes will not be read to excuse&para;<br>legal mistakes absent some indication that the legislature&para;<br>meant to do so. See, e.g., Armour Packing Co. v. United&para;<br>States, 209 U. S. 56, 70, 85–86 (1908) (rejecting the defen&para;<br>dant’s attempt to read a mistake-of-law defense into a&para;<br>criminal statute forbidding shippers to “obtain or dispose&para;<br>of property at less than the regular rate established”);&para;<br>ante, at 7–8 (discussing a federal statute imposing liability&para;<br>for “intentional discrimination”).&para;<br>In the present case, however, the Court is not asked&para;<br>whether a mistake of law should excuse respondents from&para;<br>a general prohibition that would otherwise cover their&para;<br>conduct. Rather, the issue is the scope of an express ex&para;<br>ception to a general prohibition. There is good reason to&para;<br>think the distinction matters. It is one thing to presume&para;<br>that Congress does not intend to create an exception to a&para;<br>general rule through silence; it is quite another to pre&para;<br>sume that an explicit statutory exception should be con&para;<br>fined despite the existence of other sensible interpreta&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, &para;<br>&para;<br>KRAMER &amp; ULRICH LPA &para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>tions. Cf. Kosak v. United States, 465 U. S. 848, 853, n. 9&para;<br>(1984) (although the Federal Tort Claims Act waives&para;<br>sovereign immunity, “the proper objective of a court at&para;<br>tempting to construe [an exception to the Act] is to identify&para;<br>those circumstances which are within the words and&para;<br>reason of the exception—no less and no more” (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted)). This is all the more true&para;<br>where the other possible interpretations are more consis&para;<br>tent with the purposes of the regulatory scheme. By its&para;<br>terms, §1692k(c) encompasses—without limitation—all&para;<br>violations that are “not intentional and resul[t] from a&para;<br>bona fide error.” The Court provides no reason to read&para;<br>this language narrowly.&para;<br>The Court responds that “our precedents have made&para;<br>clear for more than 175 years” that the presumption&para;<br>against mistake-of-law defenses applies even to explicit&para;<br>statutory exceptions. Ante, 6–7, n. 5. By this the Court&para;<br>means that one case applied the presumption to an excep&para;<br>tion more than 175 years ago. In Barlow, the Court de&para;<br>clined to excuse an alleged mistake of law despite a statu&para;<br>tory provision that excepted “false denomination[s] . . .&para;<br>[that] happened by mistake or accident, and not from any&para;<br>intention to defraud the revenue.” 7 Pet., at 406. In&para;<br>construing this language, the Barlow Court noted that it&para;<br>demonstrated congressional intent to exclude mistakes of&para;<br>law:&para;<br>“The very association of mistake and accident, in this&para;<br>[connection], furnishes a strong ground to presume&para;<br>that the legislature had the same classes of cases in&para;<br>view . . . . Mistakes in the construction of the law,&para;<br>seem as little intended to be excepted by the proviso,&para;<br>as accidents in the construction of the law.” Id., at&para;<br>411–412.&para;<br>Unlike the provision at issue in Barlow, §1692k(c) gives no&para;<br>indication that its broad reference to “bona fide error[s]”&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>was meant to exclude legal mistakes.&para;<br>Even if statutory exceptions should normally be con&para;<br>strued to exclude mistakes of law, moreover, that guide&para;<br>line would only apply absent intent to depart from the&para;<br>general rule. There is no doubt that Congress may create&para;<br>a mistake-of-law defense; the question is whether it has&para;<br>done so here. See Ratzlaf, 510 U. S, at 149. As explained&para;<br>above, see Part I–A, supra, Congress has made its choice&para;<br>plain by using the word “violation” in §1692k(c) to indicate&para;<br>that mistakes of law are to be included.&para;<br>Second, the Court attempts to draw a contrast between&para;<br>§1692k(c) and the administrative penalties in the Federal&para;<br>Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), 38 Stat. 717, 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§41 et seq. Under the FTC Act, a debt collector may face&para;<br>civil penalties of up to $16,000 per day for acting with&para;<br>“actual knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis&para;<br>of objective circumstances that [an] act is” prohibited&para;<br>under the FDCPA. §§45(m)(1)(A), (C); 74 Fed. Reg. 858&para;<br>(2009) (amending 16 CFR §1.98(d) (2009)). The Court&para;<br>reasons that the FTC provision is meant to provide rela&para;<br>tively harsh penalties for intentional violations. By con&para;<br>trast, the argument continues, the penalties in the FDCPA&para;<br>itself must cover—and hence §1692k(c) must not excuse—&para;<br>unintentional violations. Ante, at 8–9.&para;<br>The argument rests on a mistaken premise—namely,&para;<br>that §1692k(c) must immunize all legal errors or none.&para;<br>This misreads the statute. As the text states, it applies&para;<br>only to “bona fide” errors committed despite “the mainte&para;<br>nance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid” these&para;<br>mistakes. So under a sensible reading of the statute,&para;<br>(1) intentional violations are punishable under the height&para;<br>ened penalties of the FTC Act; (2) unintentional violations&para;<br>are generally subject to punishment under the FDCPA;&para;<br>and (3) a defendant may escape liability altogether by&para;<br>proving that a violation was based on a bona fide error&para;<br>and that reasonable error-prevention procedures were in&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, &para;<br>&para;<br>KRAMER &amp; ULRICH LPA &para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>place. There is nothing incongruous in this scheme.&para;<br>Indeed, for the reasons described in Part I, supra, it is far&para;<br>less peculiar than the Court’s reading, which would sub&para;<br>ject attorneys to liability for good-faith legal advocacy,&para;<br>even advocacy based on an accurate assessment of then&para;<br>existing case law.&para;<br>Third, in construing §1692k(c) to exclude legal errors,&para;<br>the Court points to the requirement that a debt collector&para;<br>maintain “procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any&para;<br>such error.” The Court asserts that this phrase most&para;<br>naturally evokes procedures to avoid clerical or factual&para;<br>mistakes. There is nothing natural in reading this phrase&para;<br>contrary to its plain terms, which do not distinguish be&para;<br>tween different categories of mistakes. Nor is there any&para;<br>thing unusual about procedures adopted to avoid legal&para;<br>mistakes. The present case is again instructive. Accord&para;<br>ing to the District Court, respondents designated a lead&para;<br>FDCPA compliance attorney, who regularly attended&para;<br>conferences and seminars; subscribed to relevant periodi&para;<br>cals; distributed leading FDCPA cases to all attorneys;&para;<br>trained new attorneys on their statutory obligations; and&para;<br>held regular firm-wide meetings on FDCPA issues. See&para;<br>538 F. 3d 469, 477 (CA6 2008). These procedures are not&para;<br>only “reasonably adapted to avoid [legal] error[s],” but also&para;<br>accord with the FDCPA’s purposes.&para;<br>The Court argues, nonetheless, that the statute contem&para;<br>plates only clerical or factual errors, for these are the type&para;<br>of errors that can mostly naturally be addressed through&para;<br>“ ‘a series of steps followed in a regular orderly definite&para;<br>way.’ ” Ante, at 12 (quoting Webster’s Third New Interna&para;<br>tional Dictionary 1807 (1976)). As made clear by the steps&para;<br>that respondents have taken to ensure FDCPA compli&para;<br>ance, this is simply not true. The Court also speculates&para;<br>that procedures to avoid clerical or factual errors will be&para;<br>easier to implement than procedures to avoid legal errors.&para;<br>Even if this were not pure conjecture, it has nothing to do&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>with what the statute requires. The statute does not talk&para;<br>about procedures that eliminate all—or even most—&para;<br>errors. It merely requires procedures “reasonably adapted&para;<br>to avoid any such error.” The statute adopts the sensible&para;<br>approach of requiring reasonable safeguards if liability is&para;<br>to be avoided. This approach, not the Court’s interpreta&para;<br>tion, reflects the reality of debt-collection practices.&para;<br>Fourth, the Court argues that construing §1692k(c) to&para;<br>encompass a mistake-of-law defense “is at odds with” the&para;<br>role contemplated for the FTC. Ante, at 13. This is so, it&para;<br>contends, because the FTC is authorized to issue advisory&para;<br>opinions, and the statute shields from liability “any act&para;<br>done or omitted in good faith in conformity” with such&para;<br>opinions. §1692k(e). But why, asks the Court, would a&para;<br>debt collector seek an opinion from the FTC if immunity&para;<br>under §1692k(c) could be obtained simply by relying in&para;<br>good faith on advice from private counsel? Going further,&para;<br>the Court suggests that debt collectors might “have an&para;<br>affirmative incentive not to seek an advisory opinion to&para;<br>resolve ambiguity in the law, which would then prevent&para;<br>them from claiming good-faith immunity for violations.”&para;<br>Ante, at 13.&para;<br>There is little substance to this line of reasoning. As the&para;<br>Court itself acknowledges, debt collectors would have an&para;<br>incentive to invoke the FTC safe harbor even if §1692k(c)&para;<br>is construed to include a mistake-of-law defense, because&para;<br>the safe harbor provides a “more categorical immunity.”&para;<br>Ante, at 13, n. 8. Additionally, if a debt collector avoids&para;<br>seeking an advisory opinion from the FTC out of concern&para;<br>that the answer will be unfavorable, that seems quite at&para;<br>odds with saying that his or her ignorance is “bona fide.”&para;<br>It should be noted further that the Court’s concern&para;<br>about encouraging ignorance could apply just as well to&para;<br>§45(m)(1)(A). That provision subjects a debt collector to&para;<br>harsh penalties for violating an FTC rule “with actual&para;<br>knowledge or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, &para;<br>&para;<br>KRAMER &amp; ULRICH LPA &para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>objective circumstances that such act is unfair or deceptive&para;<br>and is prohibited by such rule.” No one contends that this&para;<br>will encourage debt collectors to avoid learning the FTC’s&para;<br>rules. Yet there is no doubt that §45(m)(1)(A) permits a&para;<br>mistake-of-law defense.&para;<br>All this assumes, of course, that obtaining an FTC advi&para;<br>sory opinion will be a reasonably practical possibility. For&para;<br>the reasons stated above, see Part I–B–2, supra, this is to&para;<br>be doubted. Even the Court recognizes the limited role&para;<br>that the FTC has played. Ante, at 25 (“[E]vidence of pre&para;<br>sent administrative practice makes us reluctant to place&para;<br>significant weight on §1692k(e) as a practical remedy”).&para;<br>Fifth, the Court asserts that “[a]ny remaining doubt”&para;<br>about its preferred interpretation is dispelled by the&para;<br>FDCPA’s statutory history. The Court points to the fact&para;<br>that §1692k(c) mirrors a bona fide error defense provision&para;<br>in the earlier enacted Truth in Lending Act (TILA), argu&para;<br>ing that Congress sought to incorporate into the FDCPA&para;<br>the view of the Courts of Appeals that the TILA defense&para;<br>applied only to clerical errors. Ante, at 14–15. As JUSTICE&para;<br>SCALIA points out, the Court’s claims of judicial uniformity&para;<br>are overstated. See ante, at 2–3 (opinion concurring in&para;<br>part and concurring in judgment). They rest on three&para;<br>Court of Appeals decisions, which are contradicted by&para;<br>several District Court opinions and a State Supreme Court&para;<br>opinion—hardly a consistent legal backdrop against which&para;<br>to divine legislative intent. The Court also ignores the fact&para;<br>that those three Courts of Appeals had construed the&para;<br>TILA provision to apply only to clerical errors. See Ives v.&para;<br>W. T. Grant Co., 522 F. 2d 749, 758 (CA2 1975); Haynes v.&para;<br>Logan Furniture Mart, Inc., 503 F. 2d 1161, 1167 (CA7&para;<br>1974); Palmer v. Wilson, 502 F. 2d 860, 861 (CA9 1974).&para;<br>The Court therefore cannot explain why it reads §1692k(c)&para;<br>more broadly to encompass factual mistakes as well.&para;<br>It is of even greater significance that in 1980 Congress&para;<br>amended the TILA’s bona fide error exception explicitly to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>exclude “an error of legal judgment with respect to a per&para;<br>son’s obligations under [the TILA].” See Truth in Lending&para;<br>Simplification and Reform Act, §615 (c), 94 Stat. 181. This&para;<br>amendment would have been unnecessary if Congress had&para;<br>understood the pre-1980 language to exclude legal errors.&para;<br>The natural inference is that the pre-amendment TILA&para;<br>language—the same language later incorporated nearly&para;<br>verbatim into §1692k(c)—was understood to cover those&para;<br>errors.&para;<br>The Court’s responses to this point are perplexing. The&para;<br>Court first says that the 1980 amendment did not “obvi&para;<br>ous[ly]” change the scope of the TILA’s bona fide error&para;<br>defense, given the “uniform interpretation” that the de&para;<br>fense had been given in the Courts of Appeals. Ante, at&para;<br>17. The Court thus prefers to make an entire statutory&para;<br>amendment surplusage rather than abandon its dubious&para;<br>assumption that Congress meant to ratify a nascent Court&para;<br>of Appeals consensus. Cf. Corley v. United States, 556&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9) (“[O]ne of the most&para;<br>basic interpretive canons [is] that [a] statute should be&para;<br>construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so&para;<br>that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or&para;<br>insignificant” (internal quotation marks omitted; second&para;<br>alteration in original)). (Without any evidence, the Court&para;<br>speculates that perhaps the amendment was intended to&para;<br>codify existing judicial interpretations that excluded legal&para;<br>errors. Ante, at 17–18. If those judicial interpretation&para;<br>were truly as uniform as the Court suggests—and&para;<br>the presumption against mistake-of-law defenses as&para;<br>ironclad—there would have been no need for such a&para;<br>recodification.)&para;<br>The Court is hesitant as well to give the 1980 amend&para;<br>ment weight because Congress “has not expressly included&para;<br>mistakes of law in any of the numerous bona fide error&para;<br>defenses, worded in pertinent part identically to §1692k(c),&para;<br>elsewhere in the U. S. Code.” Ante, at 18 (emphasis in&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>JERMAN v. CARLISLE, MCNELLIE, RINI, &para;<br>&para;<br>KRAMER &amp; ULRICH LPA &para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>original). In other words, the Court refuses to read&para;<br>§1692k(c) to cover mistakes of law because other bona fide&para;<br>error statutes do not expressly refer to such mistakes. But&para;<br>the reverse should be true: If other bona fide error provi&para;<br>sions included mistake-of-law language but §1692k(c) did&para;<br>not, we might think that the omission in §1692k(c) sig&para;<br>naled Congress’s intent to exclude mistakes of law. The&para;<br>absence of mistake-of-law language in §1692k(c) is conse&para;<br>quently less noteworthy because other statutes also omit&para;<br>such language.&para;<br>The Court emphasizes that some bona fide error de&para;<br>fenses, like the one in the current version of the TILA,&para;<br>expressly exclude legal errors from their scope. Ante, at&para;<br>18 (citing 12 U. S. C. §4010(c)(2)). Yet this also can prove&para;<br>the opposite of what the Court says it does: If a bona fide&para;<br>error defense were generally assumed not to include legal&para;<br>mistakes (as the Court argues), there would be no need to&para;<br>expressly exclude them. It is only if the defense would&para;<br>otherwise include such errors that exclusionary language&para;<br>becomes necessary. By writing explicit exclusionary lan&para;<br>guage into the TILA (and some other federal provisions),&para;<br>Congress has indicated that those provisions would other&para;<br>wise cover good-faith legal errors.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>For these reasons, §1692k(c) is best read to encompass&para;<br>mistakes of law. I would affirm the judgment of the Court&para;<br>of Appeals.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
