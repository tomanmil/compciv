MCCUTCHEN ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–1285. Argued November 27, 2012—Decided April 16, 2013&para;<br>The health benefits plan established by petitioner US Airways paid&para;<br>$66,866 in medical expenses for injuries suffered by respondent&para;<br>McCutchen, a US Airways employee, in a car accident caused by a&para;<br>third party. The plan entitled US Airways to reimbursement if&para;<br>McCutchen later recovered money from the third party. McCutchen’s&para;<br>attorneys secured $110,000 in payments, and McCutchen received&para;<br>$66,000 after deducting the lawyers’ 40% contingency fee. US Airways demanded reimbursement of the full $66,866 it had paid. When&para;<br>McCutchen did not comply, US Airways filed suit under §502(a)(3) of&para;<br>the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),&para;<br>which authorizes health-plan administrators to bring a civil action&para;<br>“to obtain . . . appropriate equitable relief . . . to enforce . . . the terms&para;<br>of the plan.” McCutchen raised two defenses to US Airways’ request&para;<br>for an equitable lien on the $66,866 it demanded: that, absent overrecovery on his part, US Airways’ right to reimbursement did not&para;<br>kick in; and that US Airways had to contribute its fair share to the&para;<br>costs he incurred to get his recovery, so any reimbursement had to be&para;<br>reduced by 40%, to cover the contingency fee. Rejecting both arguments, the District Court granted summary judgment to US Airways.&para;<br>The Third Circuit vacated. Reasoning that traditional “equitable&para;<br>doctrines and defenses” applied to §502(a)(3) suits, it held that the&para;<br>principle of unjust enrichment overrode US Airways’ reimbursement&para;<br>clause because the clause would leave McCutchen with less than full&para;<br>payment for his medical bills and would give US Airways a windfall.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. In a §502(a)(3) action based on an equitable lien by agreement—&para;<br>like this one—the ERISA plan’s terms govern. Neither general unjust enrichment principles nor specific doctrines reflecting those principles—such as the double-recovery or common-fund rules invoked by&para;<br>McCutchen—can override the applicable contract. Pp. 5–11.&para;<br>(a) Section 502(a)(3) authorizes the kinds of relief “typically&para;<br>available in equity” before the merger of law and equity. Mertens v.&para;<br>Hewitt Associates, 508 U. S. 248, 256. In Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic&para;<br>Medical Services, Inc., 547 U. S. 356, the Court permitted a healthplan administrator to bring a suit just like this one. The administrator’s claim to enforce its reimbursement clause, the Court explained,&para;<br>was the modern-day equivalent of an action in equity to enforce a&para;<br>contract-based lien—called an “equitable lien ‘by agreement.’ ” Id., at&para;<br>364–365. Accordingly, the administrator could use §502(a)(3) to obtain funds that its beneficiaries had promised to turn over. The parties agree that US Airways can do the same here. Pp. 5–6.&para;<br>(b) Sereboff’s logic dooms McCutchen’s argument that two equitable doctrines meant to prevent unjust enrichment—the doublerecovery rule and common-fund doctrine—can override the terms of&para;<br>an ERISA plan in such a suit. As in Sereboff, US Airways is seeking&para;<br>to enforce the modern-day equivalent of an equitable lien by agreement. Such a lien both arises from and serves to carry out a contract’s provisions. See 547 U. S., at 363–364. Thus, enforcing the&para;<br>lien means holding the parties to their mutual promises and declining to apply rules—even if they would be “equitable” absent a contract—at odds with the parties’ expressed commitments. The Court&para;<br>has found nothing to the contrary in the historic practice of equity&para;<br>courts. McCutchen identifies a slew of cases in which courts applied&para;<br>the equitable doctrines invoked here, but none in which they did so to&para;<br>override a clear contract that provided otherwise. This result comports with ERISA’s focus on what a plan provides: §502(a)(3) does not&para;<br>“authorize ‘appropriate equitable relief’ at large,” Mertens, 508 U. S.,&para;<br>at 253, but countenances only such relief as will enforce “the terms of&para;<br>the plan” or the statute. Pp. 6–11.&para;<br>2. While McCutchen’s equitable rules cannot trump a reimbursement provision, they may aid in properly construing it. US Airways’&para;<br>plan is silent on the allocation of attorney’s fees, and the commonfund doctrine provides the appropriate default rule to fill that gap.&para;<br>Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>(a) Ordinary contract interpretation principles support this conclusion. Courts construe ERISA plans, as they do other contracts, by&para;<br>“looking to the terms of the plan” as well as to “other manifestations&para;<br>of the parties’ intent.” Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>U. S. 101, 113. Where the terms of a plan leave gaps, courts must&para;<br>“look outside the plan’s written language” to decide the agreement’s&para;<br>meaning, CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 563 U. S. ___, ___, and they properly take account of the doctrines that typically or traditionally have&para;<br>governed a given situation when no agreement states otherwise.&para;<br>Pp. 12–13.&para;<br>(b) US Airways’ reimbursement provision precludes looking to&para;<br>the double-recovery rule in this manner because it provides an allocation formula that expressly contradicts the equitable rule. By contrast, the plan says nothing specific about how to pay for the costs of&para;<br>recovery. Given that contractual gap, the common-fund doctrine provides the best indication of the parties’ intent. This Court’s cases&para;<br>make clear that the doctrine would govern here in the absence of a&para;<br>contrary agreement. See, e.g., Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, 444 U. S.&para;<br>472, 478. Because a party would not typically expect or intend a plan&para;<br>saying nothing about attorney’s fees to abrogate so strong and uniform a background rule, a court should be loath to read the plan in&para;<br>that way. The common-fund rule’s rationale reinforces this conclusion: Without the rule, the insurer can free ride on the beneficiary’s&para;<br>efforts, and the beneficiary, as in this case, may be made worse off for&para;<br>having pursued a third party. A contract should not be read to produce these strange results unless it specifically provides as much.&para;<br>Pp. 13–16.&para;<br>663 F. 3d 671, vacated and remanded.&para;<br>KAGAN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which KENNEDY,&para;<br>GINSBURG, BREYER, and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., joined.

MCCUTCHEN ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[April 16, 2013] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>Respondent James McCutchen participated in a health&para;<br>benefits plan that his employer, petitioner US Airways,&para;<br>established under the Employee Retirement Income&para;<br>Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U. S. C. §1001 et seq.&para;<br>That plan obliged US Airways to pay any medical expenses McCutchen incurred as a result of a third party’s&para;<br>actions—for example, another person’s negligent driving. The&para;<br>plan in turn entitled US Airways to reimbursement if&para;<br>McCutchen later recovered money from the third party.&para;<br>This Court has held that a health-plan administrator&para;<br>like US Airways may enforce such a reimbursement provi­&para;<br>sion by filing suit under §502(a)(3) of ERISA, 88 Stat. 891,&para;<br>29 U. S. C. §1132(a)(3). See Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc., 547 U. S. 356 (2006). That section au­&para;<br>thorizes a civil action “to obtain . . . appropriate equitable&para;<br>relief . . . to enforce . . . the terms of the plan.” We here&para;<br>consider whether in that kind of suit, a plan participant&para;<br>like McCutchen may raise certain equitable defenses&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>deriving from principles of unjust enrichment. In particu­&para;<br>lar, we address one equitable doctrine limiting reim­&para;<br>bursement to the amount of an insured’s “double recovery”&para;<br>and another requiring the party seeking reimbursement to&para;<br>pay a share of the attorney’s fees incurred in securing&para;<br>funds from the third party. We hold that neither of those&para;<br>equitable rules can override the clear terms of a plan. But&para;<br>we explain that the latter, usually called the common-fund&para;<br>doctrine, plays a role in interpreting US Airways’ plan&para;<br>because the plan is silent about allocating the costs of&para;<br>recovery.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In January 2007, McCutchen suffered serious injuries&para;<br>when another driver lost control of her car and collided&para;<br>with McCutchen’s. At the time, McCutchen was an em­&para;<br>ployee of US Airways and a participant in its self-funded&para;<br>health plan. The plan paid $66,866 in medical expenses&para;<br>arising from the accident on McCutchen’s behalf.&para;<br>McCutchen retained attorneys, in exchange for a 40%&para;<br>contingency fee, to seek recovery of all his accident-related&para;<br>damages, estimated to exceed $1 million. The attorneys&para;<br>sued the driver responsible for the crash, but settled for&para;<br>only $10,000 because she had limited insurance coverage&para;<br>and the accident had killed or seriously injured three&para;<br>other people. Counsel also secured a payment from&para;<br>McCutchen’s own automobile insurer of $100,000, the&para;<br>maximum amount available under his policy. McCutchen&para;<br>thus received $110,000—and after deducting $44,000 for&para;<br>the lawyer’s fee, $66,000.&para;<br>On learning of McCutchen’s recovery, US Airways de­&para;<br>manded reimbursement of the $66,866 it had paid in&para;<br>medical expenses. In support of that claim, US Airways&para;<br>relied on the following statement in its summary plan&para;<br>description:&para;<br>“If [US Airways] pays benefits for any claim you incur&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>as the result of negligence, willful misconduct, or other&para;<br>actions of a third party, . . . [y]ou will be required to&para;<br>reimburse [US Airways] for amounts paid for claims&para;<br>out of any monies recovered from [the] third party,&para;<br>including, but not limited to, your own insurance&para;<br>company as the result of judgment, settlement, or&para;<br>otherwise.” App. 20.1&para;<br>McCutchen denied that US Airways was entitled to any&para;<br>reimbursement, but his attorneys placed $41,500 in an&para;<br>escrow account pending resolution of the dispute. That&para;<br>amount represented US Airways’ full claim minus a pro­&para;<br>portionate share of the promised attorney’s fees.&para;<br>US Airways then filed this action under §502(a)(3),&para;<br>seeking “appropriate equitable relief ” to enforce the plan’s&para;<br>reimbursement provision. The suit requested an equitable&para;<br>lien on $66,866—the $41,500 in the escrow account and&para;<br>$25,366 more in McCutchen’s possession. McCutchen&para;<br>countered by raising two defenses relevant here. First, he&para;<br>maintained that US Airways could not receive the relief it&para;<br>sought because he had recovered only a small portion of&para;<br>his total damages; absent over-recovery on his part, US&para;<br>Airways’ right to reimbursement did not kick in. Second,&para;<br>he contended that US Airways at least had to contribute&para;<br>its fair share to the costs he incurred to get his recovery;&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 We have made clear that the statements in a summary plan descrip­&para;<br>tion “communicat[e] with beneficiaries about the plan, but . . . do&para;<br>not themselves constitute the terms of the plan.” CIGNA Corp. v.&para;<br>Amara, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 15). Nonetheless, the&para;<br>parties litigated this case, and both lower courts decided it, based solely&para;<br>on the language quoted above. See 663 F. 3d 671, 673 (CA3 2011); App.&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert. 26a. Only in this Court, in response to a request from&para;<br>the Solicitor General, did the plan itself come to light. See Letter from&para;<br>Matthew W. H. Wessler to William K. Suter, Clerk of Court (Nov. 19,&para;<br>2012) (available in Clerk of Court’s case file). That is too late to affect&para;<br>what happens here: Because everyone in this case has treated the&para;<br>language from the summary description as though it came from the&para;<br>plan, we do so as well.&para;<br>&para;<br>US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>any reimbursement therefore had to be marked down by&para;<br>40%, to cover the promised contingency fee. The District&para;<br>Court rejected both arguments, granting summary judg­&para;<br>ment to US Airways on the ground that the plan “clear[ly]&para;<br>and unambiguous[ly]” provided for full reimbursement of&para;<br>the medical expenses paid. App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a; see&para;<br>id., at 32a.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the&para;<br>District Court’s order. The Third Circuit reasoned that in&para;<br>a suit for “appropriate equitable relief ” under §502(a)(3), a&para;<br>court must apply any “equitable doctrines and defenses”&para;<br>that traditionally limited the relief requested. 663 F. 3d&para;<br>671, 676 (CA3 2011). And here, the court continued, “ ‘the&para;<br>principle of unjust enrichment’ ” should “ ‘serve to limit the&para;<br>effectiveness’ ” of the plan’s reimbursement provision. See&para;<br>id., at 677 (quoting 4 G. Palmer, Law of Restitution&para;<br>§23.18, p. 472–473 (1978)). Full reimbursement, the Third&para;<br>Circuit thought, would “leav[e] [McCutchen] with less&para;<br>than full payment” for his medical bills; at the same time,&para;<br>it would provide a “windfall” to US Airways given its&para;<br>failure to “contribute to the cost of obtaining the third­&para;<br>party recovery.” 663 F. 3d, at 679. The Third Circuit then&para;<br>instructed the District Court to determine what amount,&para;<br>shy of the entire $66,866, would qualify as “appropriate&para;<br>equitable relief.” Ibid.&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 567 U.

Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508&para;<br>U. S. 248, 256 (1993) (emphasis deleted).&para;<br>In Sereboff v.

Mid Atlantic had paid medical&para;<br>expenses for the Sereboffs after they were injured in a car&para;<br>crash. When they settled a tort suit against the other&para;<br>driver, Mid Atlantic claimed a share of the proceeds,&para;<br>invoking the plan’s reimbursement clause. We held&para;<br>that Mid Atlantic’s action sought “equitable relief,” as&para;<br>§502(a)(3) requires. See 547 U. S., at 369. The “nature of&para;<br>the recovery” requested was equitable because Mid Atlan­&para;<br>tic claimed “specifically identifiable funds” within the&para;<br>Sereboffs’ control—that is, a portion of the settlement they&para;<br>had gotten. Id., at 362–363 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted). And the “basis for [the] claim” was equitable too,&para;<br>because Mid Atlantic relied on “ ‘the familiar rul[e] of&para;<br>equity that a contract to convey a specific object’ ” not yet&para;<br>acquired “ ‘create[s] a lien’ ” on that object as soon as “ ‘the&para;<br>contractor . . . gets a title to the thing.’ ” Id., at 363–364&para;<br>——————&para;<br>&amp; Wansbrough, 354 F. 3d 348, 362 (CA5 2003) (same); Administrative&para;<br>Comm. of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

S. 117, 121 (1914)).&para;<br>Mid Atlantic’s claim for reimbursement, we determined,&para;<br>was the modern-day equivalent of an action in equity to&para;<br>enforce such a contract-based lien—called an “equitable&para;<br>lien by agreement.” 547 U. S., at 364–365 (internal quota­&para;<br>tion marks omitted). Accordingly, Mid Atlantic could&para;<br>bring an action under §502(a)(3) seeking the funds that its&para;<br>beneficiaries had promised to turn over. And here, as all&para;<br>parties agree, US Airways can do the same thing.&para;<br>The question in this case concerns the role that equita­&para;<br>ble defenses alleging unjust enrichment can play in such a&para;<br>suit. As earlier noted, the Third Circuit held that “the&para;<br>principle of unjust enrichment” overrides US Airways’&para;<br>reimbursement clause if and when they come into conflict.&para;<br>663 F. 3d, at 677. McCutchen offers a more refined ver­&para;<br>sion of that view, alleging that two specific equitable&para;<br>doctrines meant to “prevent unjust enrichment” defeat the&para;<br>reimbursement provision. Brief for Respondents i. First,&para;<br>he contends that in equity, an insurer in US Airways’&para;<br>position could recoup no more than an insured’s “double&para;<br>recovery”—the amount the insured has received from a&para;<br>third party to compensate for the same loss the insurance&para;<br>covered. That rule would limit US Airways’ reimburse­&para;<br>ment to the share of McCutchen’s settlements paying for&para;<br>medical expenses; McCutchen would keep the rest (e.g.,&para;<br>damages for loss of future earnings or pain and suffering),&para;<br>even though the plan gives US Airways first claim on the&para;<br>whole third-party recovery. Second, McCutchen claims&para;<br>that in equity the common-fund doctrine would have&para;<br>operated to reduce any award to US Airways. Under that&para;<br>rule, “a litigant or a lawyer who recovers a common fund&para;<br>for the benefit of persons other than himself or his client is&para;<br>entitled to a reasonable attorney’s fee from the fund as a&para;<br>whole.” Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, 444 U. S. 472, 478&para;<br>(1980). McCutchen urges that this doctrine, which is&para;<br>designed to prevent freeloading, enables him to pass on a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>share of his lawyer’s fees to US Airways, no matter what&para;<br>the plan provides.4&para;<br>We rejected a similar claim in Sereboff, though without&para;<br>altogether foreclosing McCutchen’s position. The Sere­&para;<br>boffs argued, among other things, that the lower courts&para;<br>erred in enforcing Mid Atlantic’s reimbursement clause&para;<br>“without imposing various limitations” that would “apply&para;<br>to truly equitable relief grounded in principles of subroga­&para;<br>tion.”5 547 U. S., at 368 (internal quotation marks omit­&para;<br>ted). In particular, the Sereboffs contended that a variant&para;<br>of the double-recovery rule, called the make-whole doc­&para;<br>trine, trumped the plan’s terms. We rebuffed that argu­&para;<br>ment, explaining that the Sereboffs were improperly&para;<br>mixing and matching rules from different equitable boxes.&para;<br>The Sereboffs asserted a “parcel of equitable defenses”&para;<br>available when an out-of-pocket insurer brought a “free­&para;<br>standing action for equitable subrogation,” not founded on&para;<br>a contract, to succeed to an insured’s judgment against a&para;<br>third party. Ibid. But Mid Atlantic’s reimbursement&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Both our prior cases and secondary sources confirm McCutchen’s&para;<br>characterization of the common-fund and double-recovery rules as&para;<br>deriving primarily from principles of unjust enrichment.

(internal quotation marks omitted). In&para;<br>light of that fact, we viewed the Sereboffs’ equitable de­&para;<br>fenses—which again, closely resemble McCutchen’s—as&para;<br>“beside the point.” Ibid. And yet, we left a narrow open­&para;<br>ing for future litigants in the Sereboffs’ position to make a&para;<br>like claim. In a footnote, we observed that the Sereboffs&para;<br>had forfeited a “distinct assertion” that the contract-based&para;<br>relief Mid Atlantic requested, although “equitable,” was&para;<br>not “appropriate” under §502(a)(3) because “it contravened&para;<br>principles like the make-whole doctrine.” Id., at 368–369&para;<br>n. 2. Enter McCutchen, to make that basic argument.&para;<br>In the end, however, Sereboff ’s logic dooms McCutchen’s&para;<br>effort. US Airways, like Mid Atlantic, is seeking to enforce&para;<br>the modern-day equivalent of an “equitable lien by agree­&para;<br>ment.” And that kind of lien—as its name announces—&para;<br>both arises from and serves to carry out a contract’s provi­&para;<br>sions. See id., at 363–364; 4 S. Symons, Pomeroy’s Equity&para;<br>Jurisprudence §1234, p. 695 (5th ed. 1941). So enforcing&para;<br>the lien means holding the parties to their mutual promis­&para;<br>es. See, e.g., Barnes, 232 U. S., at 121; Walker v. Brown,&para;<br>165 U. S. 654, 664 (1897). Conversely, it means declining&para;<br>to apply rules—even if they would be “equitable” in a&para;<br>contract’s absence—at odds with the parties’ expressed&para;<br>commitments. McCutchen therefore cannot rely on theo­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The Sereboff Court’s analysis concerned only subrogation actions&para;<br>based on equitable principles independent of any agreement. A subro­&para;<br>gation action may also be founded on a contract incorporating those&para;<br>principles. See 1 Dobbs §4.3(4), at 604. US Airways suggested at oral&para;<br>argument that McCutchen’s case would “ge[t] a lot stronger” if the plan&para;<br>here spoke only of subrogation, without separately granting a right of&para;<br>reimbursement. Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. We need not consider that ques­&para;<br>tion because US Airways seeks to enforce a reimbursement provision, of&para;<br>the same kind we considered in Sereboff.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

Those principles, as we said in&para;<br>Sereboff, are “beside the point” when parties demand what&para;<br>they bargained for in a valid agreement. See Restatement&para;<br>(Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment §2(2), p. 15&para;<br>(2010) (“A valid contract defines the obligations of the&para;<br>parties as to matters within its scope, displacing to that&para;<br>extent any inquiry into unjust enrichment”). In those&para;<br>circumstances, hewing to the parties’ exchange yields&para;<br>“appropriate” as well as “equitable” relief.&para;<br>We have found nothing to the contrary in the historic&para;<br>practice of equity courts. McCutchen offers us a slew of&para;<br>cases in which those courts applied the double-recovery or&para;<br>common-fund rule to limit insurers’ efforts to recoup funds&para;<br>from their beneficiaries’ tort judgments. See Brief for&para;<br>Respondents 21–25. But his citations are not on point. In&para;<br>some of McCutchen’s cases, courts apparently applied&para;<br>equitable doctrines in the absence of any relevant contract&para;<br>provision. See, e.g., Washtenaw Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v.&para;<br>Budd, 208 Mich. 483, 486–487, 175 N. W. 231, 232 (1919);&para;<br>Fire Assn. of Philadelphia v. Wells, 84 N. J. Eq. 484, 487,&para;<br>94 A. 619, 621 (1915). In others, courts found those rules&para;<br>to comport with the applicable contract term. For exam­&para;<br>ple, in Svea Assurance Co. v. Packham, 92 Md. 464, 48 A.&para;<br>359 (1901)—the case McCutchen calls his best, see Tr. of&para;<br>Oral Arg. 47–48—the court viewed the double-recovery&para;<br>rule as according with “the intention” of the contracting&para;<br>parties; “[b]road as [the] language is,” the court explained,&para;<br>the agreement “cannot be construed to” give the insurer&para;<br>any greater recovery. 92 Md., at 478, 48 A., at 362; see&para;<br>also Knaffl v.

But in none of these cases—nor in&para;<br>any other we can find—did an equity court apply the&para;<br>double-recovery or common-fund rule to override a plain&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>contract term. That is, in none did an equity court do&para;<br>what McCutchen asks of us.&para;<br>Nevertheless, the United States, appearing as amicus&para;<br>curiae, claims that the common-fund rule has a special&para;<br>capacity to trump a conflicting contract. The Government&para;<br>begins its brief foursquare with our (and Sereboff ’s) analy­&para;<br>sis: In a suit like this one, to enforce an equitable lien by&para;<br>agreement, “the agreement, not general restitutionary&para;<br>principles of unjust enrichment, provides the measure of&para;<br>relief due.” Brief for United States 6. Because that is so,&para;<br>the Government (naturally enough) concludes, McCutchen&para;<br>cannot invoke the double-recovery rule to defeat the plan.&para;<br>But then the Government takes an unexpected turn.&para;<br>“When it comes to the costs incurred” by a beneficiary to&para;<br>obtain money from a third party, “the terms of the plan do&para;<br>not control.” Id., at 21. An equity court, the Government&para;<br>contends, has “inherent authority” to apportion litigation&para;<br>costs in accord with the “longstanding equitable common­&para;<br>fund doctrine,” even if that conflicts with the parties’&para;<br>contract. Id., at 22.&para;<br>But if the agreement governs, the agreement governs:&para;<br>The reasons we have given (and the Government mostly ac­&para;<br>cepts) for looking to the contract’s terms do not permit an&para;<br>attorney’s-fees exception. We have no doubt that the common­&para;<br>fund doctrine has deep roots in equity. See Sprague&para;<br>v. Ticonic Nat. Bank, 307 U. S. 161, 164 (1939) (tracing&para;<br>equity courts’ authority over fees to the First Judiciary&para;<br>Act). Those roots, however, are set in the soil of unjust&para;<br>enrichment: To allow “others to obtain full benefit from&para;<br>the plaintiff ’s efforts without contributing . . . to the litiga­&para;<br>tion expenses,” we have often noted, “would be to enrich&para;<br>the others unjustly at the plaintiff ’s expense.” Mills v.&para;<br>Electric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U. S. 375, 392 (1970); see Boeing, 444 U. S., at 478; Trustees v. Greenough, 105 U. S.&para;<br>527, 532 (1882); supra, at 6–7 and n. 4.

The agreement itself becomes the measure&para;<br>of the parties’ equities; so if a contract abrogates the com­&para;<br>mon-fund doctrine, the insurer is not unjustly enriched by&para;<br>claiming the benefit of its bargain. That is why the Gov­&para;<br>ernment, like McCutchen, fails to produce a single case in&para;<br>which an equity court applied the common-fund rule (any&para;<br>more than the double-recovery rule) when a contract&para;<br>provided to the contrary. Even in equity, when a party&para;<br>sought to enforce a lien by agreement, all provisions of&para;<br>that agreement controlled. So too, then, in a suit like this&para;<br>one.&para;<br>The result we reach, based on the historical analysis our&para;<br>prior cases prescribe, fits lock and key with ERISA’s focus&para;<br>on what a plan provides. The section under which this&para;<br>suit is brought “does not, after all, authorize ‘appropriate&para;<br>equitable relief ’ at large,” Mertens, 508 U. S., at 253 (quot­&para;<br>ing §1132(a)(3)); rather, it countenances only such relief&para;<br>as will enforce “the terms of the plan” or the statute,&para;<br>§1132(a)(3) (emphasis added). That limitation reflects&para;<br>ERISA’s principal function: to “protect contractually de­&para;<br>fined benefits.” Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 148 (1985). The statutory scheme, we&para;<br>have often noted, “is built around reliance on the face&para;<br>of written plan documents.” Curtiss-Wright Corp. v.&para;<br>Schoonejongen, 514 U. S. 73, 83 (1995). “Every employee&para;<br>benefit plan shall be established and maintained pursuant&para;<br>to a written instrument,” §1102(a)(1), and an administra­&para;<br>tor must act “in accordance with the documents and in­&para;<br>struments governing the plan” insofar as they accord with&para;<br>the statute, §1104(a)(1)(D). The plan, in short, is at the&para;<br>center of ERISA. And precluding McCutchen’s equitable&para;<br>defenses from overriding plain contract terms helps it to&para;<br>remain there.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>US AIRWAYS, INC. v.

The language the dissent highlights&para;<br>in McCutchen’s brief in opposition, indicating that the plan clearly&para;<br>abrogates the common-fund doctrine, comes from his description of US&para;<br>Airways’ claim in the District Court. See post, at 1 (opinion of SCALIA,&para;<br>J.); Brief in Opposition 5. McCutchen’s argument in that court urged&para;<br>the very position we adopt—that the common-fund doctrine applies&para;<br>because the plan is silent. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a; Defendants’&para;<br>Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judg­&para;<br>ment in No. 2:08–cv–1593 (WD Pa., Dec. 4, 2011), Doc. 33, pp. 12–13&para;<br>(“If [US Airways] wanted to exclude a deduction for attorney fees, it&para;<br>easily could have so expressed”).

But both&para;<br>claims have the same basis (the nature and function of the common­&para;<br>fund doctrine), which the parties have disputed throughout this litiga­&para;<br>tion. And similarly, the question we decide here is included in the&para;<br>question presented. The principal clause of that question asks whether&para;<br>a court may use “equitable principles to rewrite contractual language.”&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. i.

In undertaking that task, a court properly takes&para;<br>account of background legal rules—the doctrines that&para;<br>typically or traditionally have governed a given situation&para;<br>when no agreement states otherwise. See Wal-Mart&para;<br>Stores, Inc. Assoc. Health &amp; Welfare Plan v. Wells, 213&para;<br>F. 3d 398, 402 (CA7 2000) (Posner, J.)

Lord, Williston on&para;<br>Contracts §31:7 (4th ed. 2012); Restatement (Second) of&para;<br>Contracts §221 (1979). Indeed, ignoring those rules is&para;<br>likely to frustrate the parties’ intent and produce perverse&para;<br>consequences.&para;<br>The reimbursement provision at issue here precludes&para;<br>looking to the double-recovery rule in this manner. Both&para;<br>the contract term and the equitable principle address the&para;<br>same problem: how to apportion, as between an insurer&para;<br>and a beneficiary, a third party’s payment to recompense&para;<br>an injury. But the allocation formulas they prescribe&para;<br>differ markedly. According to the plan, US Airways has&para;<br>first claim on the entire recovery—as the plan description&para;<br>states, on “any monies recovered from [the] third party”;&para;<br>McCutchen receives only whatever is left over (if any­&para;<br>thing). See supra, at 3. By contrast, the double-recovery&para;<br>rule would give McCutchen first dibs on the portion of the&para;<br>recovery compensating for losses that the plan did not&para;<br>cover (e.g., future earnings or pain and suffering); US&para;<br>Airways’ claim would attach only to the share of the recov­&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ery for medical expenses. See supra, at 6–7. The express&para;<br>contract term, in short, contradicts the background equi­&para;<br>table rule; and where that is so, for all the reasons we&para;<br>have given, the agreement must govern.&para;<br>By contrast, the plan provision here leaves space for the&para;<br>common-fund rule to operate. That equitable doctrine, as&para;<br>earlier noted, addresses not how to allocate a third-party&para;<br>recovery, but instead how to pay for the costs of obtaining&para;<br>it. See supra, at 7. And the contract, for its part, says&para;<br>nothing specific about that issue. The District Court&para;<br>below thus erred when it found that the plan clearly repu­&para;<br>diated the common-fund rule. See supra, at 4. To be sure,&para;<br>the plan’s allocation formula—first claim on the recovery&para;<br>goes to US Airways—might operate on every dollar re­&para;<br>ceived from a third party, even those covering the benefi­&para;<br>ciary’s litigation costs. But alternatively, that formula&para;<br>could apply to only the true recovery, after the costs of&para;<br>obtaining it are deducted. (Consider, for comparative&para;<br>purposes, how an income tax is levied on net, not gross,&para;<br>receipts.) See Dawson, Lawyers and Involuntary Clients:&para;<br>Attorney Fees From Funds, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 1597, 1606–&para;<br>1607 (1974) (“[T]he claim for legal services is a first charge&para;<br>on the fund and must be satisfied before any distribution&para;<br>occurs”). The plan’s terms fail to select between these two&para;<br>alternatives: whether the recovery to which US Airways&para;<br>has first claim is every cent the third party paid or, in­&para;<br>stead, the money the beneficiary took away.&para;<br>Given that contractual gap, the common-fund doctrine&para;<br>provides the best indication of the parties’ intent. No one&para;<br>can doubt that the common-fund rule would govern here&para;<br>in the absence of a contrary agreement. This Court has&para;<br>“recognized consistently” that someone “who recovers a&para;<br>common fund for the benefit of persons other than him­&para;<br>self” is due “a reasonable attorney’s fee from the fund as&para;<br>whole.” Boeing Co., 444 U.

MCCUTCHEN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The rationale for the common-fund rule reinforces that&para;<br>conclusion. Third-party recoveries do not often come free:&para;<br>To get one, an insured must incur lawyer’s fees and ex­&para;<br>penses. Without cost sharing, the insurer free rides on its&para;<br>beneficiary’s efforts—taking the fruits while contributing&para;<br>nothing to the labor. Odder still, in some cases—indeed,&para;<br>in this case—the beneficiary is made worse off by pursuing&para;<br>a third party. Recall that McCutchen spent $44,000 (rep­&para;<br>resenting a 40% contingency fee) to get $110,000, leaving&para;<br>him with a real recovery of $66,000. But US Airways&para;<br>claimed $66,866 in medical expenses. That would put&para;<br>McCutchen $866 in the hole; in effect, he would pay for the&para;<br>privilege of serving as US Airways’ collection agent. We&para;<br>think McCutchen would not have foreseen that result&para;<br>when he signed on to the plan. And we doubt if even US&para;<br>Airways should want it. When the next McCutchen comes&para;<br>along, he is not likely to relieve US Airways of the costs of&para;<br>recovery. See Blackburn v. Sundstrand Corp., 115 F. 3d&para;<br>493, 496 (CA7 1997) (Easterbrook, J.) (“[I]f . . . injured&para;<br>persons could not charge legal costs against recoveries,&para;<br>people like [McCutchen] would in the future have every&para;<br>reason” to make different judgments about bringing suit,&para;<br>“throwing on plans the burden and expense of collection”).&para;<br>The prospect of generating those strange results again&para;<br>militates against reading a general reimbursement provi­&para;<br>sion—like the one here—for more than it is worth.

Respondents interpreted “full reimbursement” to mean what&para;<br>it plainly says—reimbursement of all the funds the Plan&para;<br>had expended. In their brief in opposition to the petition&para;<br>they conceded that, under the contract, “a beneficiary is&para;<br>required to reimburse the Plan for any amounts it has&para;<br>paid out of any monies the beneficiary recovers from a&para;<br>third-party, without any contribution to attorney’s fees and&para;<br>expenses.” Brief in Opposition 5 (emphasis added). All the&para;<br>parties, as well as the Solicitor General, have treated that&para;<br>concession as valid. See Brief for Petitioner 18, and n. 6;&para;<br>Brief for Respondents 29; Brief for United States as Ami-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>cus Curiae 21. The Court thus has no business deploying&para;<br>against petitioner an argument that was neither preserved, see Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U. S. 27, 34 (2004), nor&para;<br>fairly included within the question presented, see Yee v.&para;<br>Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 535 (1992).&para;<br>I would reverse the judgment of the Third Circuit.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
