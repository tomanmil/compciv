Detroit Timber &amp; Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL OF&para;<br>&para;<br>FLORIDA, 1ST DISTRICT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 08–7412. Argued November 9, 2009—Decided May 17, 2010; &para;<br>&para;<br>modified July 6, 2010 &para;<br>&para;<br>Petitioner Graham was 16 when he committed armed burglary and&para;<br>another crime. Under a plea agreement, the Florida trial court sen&para;<br>tenced Graham to probation and withheld adjudication of guilt. Sub&para;<br>sequently, the trial court found that Graham had violated the terms&para;<br>of his probation by committing additional crimes. The trial court ad&para;<br>judicated Graham guilty of the earlier charges, revoked his proba&para;<br>tion, and sentenced him to life in prison for the burglary. Because&para;<br>Florida has abolished its parole system, the life sentence left Graham&para;<br>no possibility of release except executive clemency. He challenged his&para;<br>sentence under the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Pun&para;<br>ishments Clause, but the State First District Court of Appeal af&para;<br>firmed.&para;<br>Held: The Clause does not permit a juvenile offender to be sentenced to&para;<br>life in prison without parole for a nonhomicide crime. Pp. 7–31.&para;<br>(a) Embodied in the cruel and unusual punishments ban is the&para;<br>“precept . . . that punishment for crime should be graduated and pro&para;<br>portioned to [the] offense.” Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349,&para;<br>367. The Court’s cases implementing the proportionality standard&para;<br>fall within two general classifications. In cases of the first type, the&para;<br>Court has considered all the circumstances to determine whether the&para;<br>length of a term-of-years sentence is unconstitutionally excessive for&para;<br>a particular defendant’s crime. The second classification comprises&para;<br>cases in which the Court has applied certain categorical rules against&para;<br>the death penalty. In a subset of such cases considering the nature of&para;<br>the offense, the Court has concluded that capital punishment is im&para;<br>permissible for nonhomicide crimes against individuals. E.g., Ken&para;<br>nedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___. In a second subset, cases turn&para;<br>ing on the offender’s characteristics, the Court has prohibited death&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>for defendants who committed their crimes before age 18, Roper v.&para;<br>Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, or whose intellectual functioning is in a low&para;<br>range, Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304. In cases involving categori&para;<br>cal rules, the Court first considers “objective indicia of society’s stan&para;<br>dards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice” to&para;<br>determine whether there is a national consensus against the sentenc&para;<br>ing practice at issue. Roper, supra, at 563. Next, looking to “the&para;<br>standards elaborated by controlling precedents and by the Court’s&para;<br>own understanding and interpretation of the Eighth Amendment’s&para;<br>text, history, meaning, and purpose,” Kennedy, supra, at ___, the&para;<br>Court determines in the exercise of its own independent judgment&para;<br>whether the punishment in question violates the Constitution, Roper,&para;<br>supra, at 564. Because this case implicates a particular type of sen&para;<br>tence as it applies to an entire class of offenders who have committed&para;<br>a range of crimes, the appropriate analysis is the categorical ap&para;<br>proach used in Atkins, Roper, and Kennedy. Pp. 7–10.&para;<br>(b) Application of the foregoing approach convinces the Court that&para;<br>the sentencing practice at issue is unconstitutional. Pp. 10–31.&para;<br>(1) Six jurisdictions do not allow life without parole sentences for&para;<br>any juvenile offenders. Seven jurisdictions permit life without parole&para;<br>for juvenile offenders, but only for homicide crimes. Thirty-seven&para;<br>States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government permit&para;<br>sentences of life without parole for a juvenile nonhomicide offender in&para;<br>some circumstances. The State relies on these data to argue that no&para;<br>national consensus against the sentencing practice in question exists.&para;<br>An examination of actual sentencing practices in those jurisdictions&para;<br>that permit life without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders,&para;<br>however, discloses a consensus against the sentence. Nationwide,&para;<br>there are only 123 juvenile offenders serving life without parole sen&para;<br>tences for nonhomicide crimes. Because 77 of those offenders are&para;<br>serving sentences imposed in Florida and the other 46 are imprisoned&para;<br>in just 10 States, it appears that only 11 jurisdictions nationwide in&para;<br>fact impose life without parole sentences on juvenile nonhomicide of&para;<br>fenders, while 26 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal&para;<br>Government do not impose them despite apparent statutory authori&para;<br>zation. Given that the statistics reflect nearly all juvenile nonhomi&para;<br>cide offenders who have received a life without parole sentence&para;<br>stretching back many years, moreover, it is clear how rare these sen&para;<br>tences are, even within the States that do sometimes impose them.&para;<br>While more common in terms of absolute numbers than the sentenc&para;<br>ing practices in, e.g., Atkins and Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, the&para;<br>type of sentence at issue is actually as rare as those other sentencing&para;<br>practices when viewed in proportion to the opportunities for its imposi&para;<br>tion. The fact that many jurisdictions do not expressly prohibit the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>sentencing practice at issue is not dispositive because it does not nec&para;<br>essarily follow that the legislatures in those jurisdictions have delib&para;<br>erately concluded that such sentences would be appropriate. See&para;<br>Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 826, n. 24, 850. Pp. 10–16.&para;<br>(2) The inadequacy of penological theory to justify life without&para;<br>parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, the limited cul&para;<br>pability of such offenders, and the severity of these sentences all lead&para;<br>the Court to conclude that the sentencing practice at issue is cruel&para;<br>and unusual. No recent data provide reason to reconsider Roper’s&para;<br>holding that because juveniles have lessened culpability they are less&para;<br>deserving of the most serious forms of punishment. 543 U. S., at 551.&para;<br>Moreover, defendants who do not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that&para;<br>life will be taken are categorically less deserving of such punishments&para;<br>than are murderers. E.g., Kennedy, supra. Serious nonhomicide&para;<br>crimes “may be devastating in their harm . . . but ‘in terms of moral&para;<br>depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public,’ . . . they&para;<br>cannot be compared to murder in their ‘severity and irrevocability.’ ”&para;<br>Id., at ___. Thus, when compared to an adult murderer, a juvenile of&para;<br>fender who did not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral&para;<br>culpability. Age and the nature of the crime each bear on the analy&para;<br>sis. As for the punishment, life without parole is “the second most&para;<br>severe penalty permitted by law,” Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S.&para;<br>957, 1001, and is especially harsh for a juvenile offender, who will on&para;<br>average serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in&para;<br>prison than an adult offender, see, e.g., Roper, supra, at 572. And&para;<br>none of the legitimate goals of penal sanctions—retribution, deter&para;<br>rence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, see Ewing v. California, 538&para;<br>U. S. 11, 25—is adequate to justify life without parole for juvenile&para;<br>nonhomicide offenders, see, e.g., Roper, 543 U. S., at 571, 573. Be&para;<br>cause age “18 is the point where society draws the line for many pur&para;<br>poses between childhood and adulthood,” it is the age below which a&para;<br>defendant may not be sentenced to life without parole for a nonhomi&para;<br>cide crime. Id., at 574. A State is not required to guarantee eventual&para;<br>freedom to such an offender, but must impose a sentence that pro&para;<br>vides some meaningful opportunity for release based on demon&para;<br>strated maturity and rehabilitation. It is for the State, in the first&para;<br>instance, to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance.&para;<br>Pp. 16–24.&para;<br>(3) A categorical rule is necessary, given the inadequacy of two&para;<br>alternative approaches to address the relevant constitutional con&para;<br>cerns. First, although Florida and other States have made substan&para;<br>tial efforts to enact comprehensive rules governing the treatment of&para;<br>youthful offenders, such laws allow the imposition of the type of sen&para;<br>tence at issue based only on a discretionary, subjective judgment by a&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>judge or jury that the juvenile offender is irredeemably depraved, and&para;<br>are therefore insufficient to prevent the possibility that the offender&para;<br>will receive such a sentence despite a lack of moral culpability. Sec&para;<br>ond, a case-by-case approach requiring that the particular offender’s&para;<br>age be weighed against the seriousness of the crime as part of a gross&para;<br>disproportionality inquiry would not allow courts to distinguish with&para;<br>sufficient accuracy the few juvenile offenders having sufficient psy&para;<br>chological maturity and depravity to merit a life without parole sen&para;<br>tence from the many that have the capacity for change. Cf. Roper,&para;<br>supra, at 572–573. Nor does such an approach take account of spe&para;<br>cial difficulties encountered by counsel in juvenile representation,&para;<br>given juveniles’ impulsiveness, difficulty thinking in terms of long&para;<br>term benefits, and reluctance to trust adults. A categorical rule&para;<br>avoids the risk that, as a result of these difficulties, a court or jury&para;<br>will erroneously conclude that a particular juvenile is sufficiently&para;<br>culpable to deserve life without parole for a nonhomicide. It also&para;<br>gives the juvenile offender a chance to demonstrate maturity and re&para;<br>form. Pp. 24–29.&para;<br>(4) Additional support for the Court’s conclusion lies in the fact&para;<br>that the sentencing practice at issue has been rejected the world over:&para;<br>The United States is the only Nation that imposes this type of sen&para;<br>tence. While the judgments of other nations and the international&para;<br>community are not dispositive as to the meaning of the Eighth&para;<br>Amendment, the Court has looked abroad to support its independent&para;<br>conclusion that a particular punishment is cruel and unusual. See,&para;<br>e.g., Roper, supra, at 575–578. Pp. 29–31.&para;<br>&para;<br>982 So. 2d 43, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which STEVENS,&para;<br>GINSBURG, BREYER, and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., joined.

The sentence was&para;<br>imposed by the State of Florida. Petitioner challenges the&para;<br>sentence under the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Un&para;<br>usual Punishments Clause, made applicable to the States&para;<br>by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.&para;<br>Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962).&para;<br>I&para;<br>Petitioner is Terrance Jamar Graham. He was born on&para;<br>January 6, 1987. Graham’s parents were addicted to&para;<br>crack cocaine, and their drug use persisted in his early&para;<br>years. Graham was diagnosed with attention deficit hy&para;<br>peractivity disorder in elementary school. He began&para;<br>drinking alcohol and using tobacco at age 9 and smoked&para;<br>marijuana at age 13.&para;<br>In July 2003, when Graham was age 16, he and three&para;<br>other school-age youths attempted to rob a barbeque&para;<br>restaurant in Jacksonville, Florida. One youth, who&para;<br>worked at the restaurant, left the back door unlocked just&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>to opinion&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>of the of&para;<br>Court&para;<br>&para;<br>before closing time. Graham and another youth, wearing&para;<br>masks, entered through the unlocked door. Graham’s&para;<br>masked accomplice twice struck the restaurant manager&para;<br>in the back of the head with a metal bar. When the man&para;<br>ager started yelling at the assailant and Graham, the two&para;<br>youths ran out and escaped in a car driven by the third&para;<br>accomplice. The restaurant manager required stitches for&para;<br>his head injury. No money was taken.&para;<br>Graham was arrested for the robbery attempt. Under&para;<br>Florida law, it is within a prosecutor’s discretion whether&para;<br>to charge 16- and 17-year-olds as adults or juveniles for&para;<br>most felony crimes. Fla. Stat. §985.227(1)(b) (2003) (sub&para;<br>sequently renumbered at §985.557(1)(b) (2007)). Gra&para;<br>ham’s prosecutor elected to charge Graham as an adult.&para;<br>The charges against Graham were armed burglary with&para;<br>assault or battery, a first-degree felony carrying a maxi&para;<br>mum penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility&para;<br>of parole, §§810.02(1)(b), (2)(a) (2003); and attempted&para;<br>armed-robbery, a second-degree felony carrying a maxi&para;<br>mum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment, §§812.13(2)(b),&para;<br>777.04(1), (4)(a), 775.082(3)(c).&para;<br>On December 18, 2003, Graham pleaded guilty to both&para;<br>charges under a plea agreement. Graham wrote a letter to&para;<br>the trial court. After reciting “this is my first and last&para;<br>time getting in trouble,” he continued “I’ve decided to turn&para;<br>my life around.” App. 379–380. Graham said “I made a&para;<br>promise to God and myself that if I get a second chance,&para;<br>I’m going to do whatever it takes to get to the [National&para;<br>Football League].” Id., at 380.&para;<br>The trial court accepted the plea agreement. The court&para;<br>withheld adjudication of guilt as to both charges and&para;<br>sentenced Graham to concurrent 3-year terms of proba&para;<br>tion. Graham was required to spend the first 12 months of&para;<br>his probation in the county jail, but he received credit for&para;<br>the time he had served awaiting trial, and was released on&para;<br>June 25, 2004.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>to opinion&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>of the of&para;<br>Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Less than 6 months later, on the night of December 2,&para;<br>2004, Graham again was arrested. The State’s case was&para;<br>as follows: Earlier that evening, Graham participated in a&para;<br>home invasion robbery. His two accomplices were Meigo&para;<br>Bailey and Kirkland Lawrence, both 20-year-old men.&para;<br>According to the State, at 7 p.m. that night, Graham,&para;<br>Bailey, and Lawrence knocked on the door of the home&para;<br>where Carlos Rodriguez lived. Graham, followed by Bailey&para;<br>and Lawrence, forcibly entered the home and held a pistol&para;<br>to Rodriguez’s chest. For the next 30 minutes, the three&para;<br>held Rodriguez and another man, a friend of Rodriguez, at&para;<br>gunpoint while they ransacked the home searching for&para;<br>money. Before leaving, Graham and his accomplices&para;<br>barricaded Rodriguez and his friend inside a closet.&para;<br>The State further alleged that Graham, Bailey, and&para;<br>Lawrence, later the same evening, attempted a second&para;<br>robbery, during which Bailey was shot. Graham, who had&para;<br>borrowed his father’s car, drove Bailey and Lawrence to&para;<br>the hospital and left them there. As Graham drove away,&para;<br>a police sergeant signaled him to stop. Graham continued&para;<br>at a high speed but crashed into a telephone pole. He&para;<br>tried to flee on foot but was apprehended. Three hand&para;<br>guns were found in his car.&para;<br>When detectives interviewed Graham, he denied in&para;<br>volvement in the crimes. He said he encountered Bailey&para;<br>and Lawrence only after Bailey had been shot. One of the&para;<br>detectives told Graham that the victims of the home inva&para;<br>sion had identified him. He asked Graham, “Aside from&para;<br>the two robberies tonight how many more were you in&para;<br>volved in?” Graham responded, “Two to three before&para;<br>tonight.” Id., at 160. The night that Graham allegedly&para;<br>committed the robbery, he was 34 days short of his 18th&para;<br>birthday.&para;<br>On December 13, 2004, Graham’s probation officer filed&para;<br>with the trial court an affidavit asserting that Graham&para;<br>had violated the conditions of his probation by possessing&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>to opinion&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>of the of&para;<br>Court&para;<br>&para;<br>a firearm, committing crimes, and associating with per&para;<br>sons engaged in criminal activity. The trial court held&para;<br>hearings on Graham’s violations about a year later, in&para;<br>December 2005 and January 2006. The judge who pre&para;<br>sided was not the same judge who had accepted Graham’s&para;<br>guilty plea to the earlier offenses.&para;<br>Graham maintained that he had no involvement in the&para;<br>home invasion robbery; but, even after the court under&para;<br>scored that the admission could expose him to a life sen&para;<br>tence on the earlier charges, he admitted violating proba&para;<br>tion conditions by fleeing. The State presented evidence&para;<br>related to the home invasion, including testimony from the&para;<br>victims. The trial court noted that Graham, in admitting&para;<br>his attempt to avoid arrest, had acknowledged violating&para;<br>his probation. The court further found that Graham had&para;<br>violated his probation by committing a home invasion&para;<br>robbery, by possessing a firearm, and by associating with&para;<br>persons engaged in criminal activity.&para;<br>The trial court held a sentencing hearing. Under Flor&para;<br>ida law the minimum sentence Graham could receive&para;<br>absent a downward departure by the judge was 5 years’&para;<br>imprisonment. The maximum was life imprisonment.&para;<br>Graham’s attorney requested the minimum nondeparture&para;<br>sentence of 5 years. A presentence report prepared by the&para;<br>Florida Department of Corrections recommended that&para;<br>Graham receive an even lower sentence—at most 4 years’&para;<br>imprisonment. The State recommended that Graham&para;<br>receive 30 years on the armed burglary count and 15 years&para;<br>on the attempted armed robbery count.&para;<br>After hearing Graham’s testimony, the trial court ex&para;<br>plained the sentence it was about to pronounce:&para;<br>“Mr. Graham, as I look back on your case, yours is&para;<br>really candidly a sad situation.

And at the time you&para;<br>seemed through your letters that that is exactly what&para;<br>you wanted to do. And I don’t know why it is that you&para;<br>threw your life away. I don’t know why.&para;<br>“But you did, and that is what is so sad about this&para;<br>today is that you have actually been given a chance to&para;<br>get through this, the original charge, which were very&para;<br>serious charges to begin with. . . . The attempted rob&para;<br>bery with a weapon was a very serious charge.&para;<br>.&para;<br>&para;<br>.&para;<br>&para;<br>.&para;<br>&para;<br>.&para;<br>&para;<br>.&para;<br>&para;<br>“[I]n a very short period of time you were back be&para;<br>fore the Court on a violation of this probation, and&para;<br>then here you are two years later standing before me,&para;<br>literally the—facing a life sentence as to—up to life as&para;<br>to count 1 and up to 15 years as to count 2.&para;<br>“And I don’t understand why you would be given&para;<br>such a great opportunity to do something with your&para;<br>life and why you would throw it away. The only thing&para;<br>that I can rationalize is that you decided that this is&para;<br>how you were going to lead your life and that there is&para;<br>nothing that we can do for you. And as the state&para;<br>pointed out, that this is an escalating pattern of&para;<br>criminal conduct on your part and that we can’t help&para;<br>you any further. We can’t do anything to deter you.&para;<br>This is the way you are going to lead your life, and I&para;<br>don’t know why you are going to. You’ve made that&para;<br>decision. I have no idea. But, evidently, that is what&para;<br>you decided to do.&para;<br>“So then it becomes a focus, if I can’t do anything to&para;<br>help you, if I can’t do anything to get you back on the&para;<br>right path, then I have to start focusing on the com&para;<br>munity and trying to protect the community from your&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v.

And, unfortunately, that is where we are to&para;<br>day is I don’t see where I can do anything to help you&para;<br>any further. You’ve evidently decided this is the di&para;<br>rection you’re going to take in life, and it’s unfortu&para;<br>nate that you made that choice.&para;<br>“I have reviewed the statute. I don’t see where any&para;<br>further juvenile sanctions would be appropriate. I&para;<br>don’t see where any youthful offender sanctions would&para;<br>be appropriate. Given your escalating pattern of&para;<br>criminal conduct, it is apparent to the Court that you&para;<br>have decided that this is the way you are going to live&para;<br>your life and that the only thing I can do now is to try&para;<br>and protect the community from your actions.” Id., at&para;<br>392–394.&para;<br>The trial court found Graham guilty of the earlier armed&para;<br>burglary and attempted armed robbery charges. It sen&para;<br>tenced him to the maximum sentence authorized by law&para;<br>on each charge: life imprisonment for the armed burglary&para;<br>and 15 years for the attempted armed robbery. Because&para;<br>Florida has abolished its parole system, see Fla. Stat.&para;<br>§921.002(1)(e) (2003), a life sentence gives a defendant&para;<br>no possibility of release unless he is granted executive&para;<br>clemency.&para;<br>Graham filed a motion in the trial court challenging his&para;<br>sentence under the Eighth Amendment. The motion was&para;<br>deemed denied after the trial court failed to rule on it&para;<br>within 60 days. The First District Court of Appeal of&para;<br>Florida affirmed, concluding that Graham’s sentence was&para;<br>not grossly disproportionate to his crimes. 982 So. 2d 43&para;<br>(2008). The court took note of the seriousness of Graham’s&para;<br>offenses and their violent nature, as well as the fact that&para;<br>they “were not committed by a pre-teen, but a seventeen&para;<br>year-old who was ultimately sentenced at the age of nine&para;<br>teen.” Id., at 52. The court concluded further that Gra&para;<br>ham was incapable of rehabilitation. Although Graham&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

J., dissenting)).&para;<br>The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause prohibits&para;<br>the imposition of inherently barbaric punishments under&para;<br>all circumstances. See, e.g., Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730&para;<br>(2002). “[P]unishments of torture,” for example, “are&para;<br>forbidden.” Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 136 (1879).&para;<br>These cases underscore the essential principle that, under&para;<br>the Eighth Amendment, the State must respect the hu&para;<br>man attributes even of those who have committed serious&para;<br>crimes.&para;<br>For the most part, however, the Court’s precedents&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>to opinion&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>of the of&para;<br>Court&para;<br>&para;<br>consider punishments challenged not as inherently bar&para;<br>baric but as disproportionate to the crime. The concept of&para;<br>proportionality is central to the Eighth Amendment.&para;<br>Embodied in the Constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual&para;<br>punishments is the “precept of justice that punishment for&para;<br>crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the] of&para;<br>fense.” Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 367 (1910).&para;<br>The Court’s cases addressing the proportionality of&para;<br>sentences fall within two general classifications. The first&para;<br>involves challenges to the length of term-of-years sen&para;<br>tences given all the circumstances in a particular case.&para;<br>The second comprises cases in which the Court imple&para;<br>ments the proportionality standard by certain categorical&para;<br>restrictions on the death penalty.&para;<br>In the first classification the Court considers all of the&para;<br>circumstances of the case to determine whether the sen&para;<br>tence is unconstitutionally excessive. Under this ap&para;<br>proach, the Court has held unconstitutional a life without&para;<br>parole sentence for the defendant’s seventh nonviolent&para;<br>felony, the crime of passing a worthless check. Solem v.&para;<br>Helm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983). In other cases, however, it&para;<br>has been difficult for the challenger to establish a lack of&para;<br>proportionality. A leading case is Harmelin v. Michigan,&para;<br>501 U. S. 957 (1991), in which the offender was sentenced&para;<br>under state law to life without parole for possessing a&para;<br>large quantity of cocaine. A closely divided Court upheld&para;<br>the sentence. The controlling opinion concluded that the&para;<br>Eighth Amendment contains a “narrow proportionality&para;<br>principle,” that “does not require strict proportionality&para;<br>between crime and sentence” but rather “forbids only&para;<br>extreme sentences that are ‘grossly disproportionate’ to&para;<br>the crime.” Id., at 997, 1000–1001 (KENNEDY, J., concur&para;<br>ring in part and concurring in judgment). Again closely&para;<br>divided, the Court rejected a challenge to a sentence of 25&para;<br>years to life for the theft of a few golf clubs under Califor&para;<br>nia’s so-called three-strikes recidivist sentencing scheme.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

California, 538 U. S. 11 (2003); see also Lockyer&para;<br>v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63 (2003). The Court has also up&para;<br>held a sentence of life with the possibility of parole for a&para;<br>defendant’s third nonviolent felony, the crime of obtaining&para;<br>money by false pretenses, Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263&para;<br>(1980), and a sentence of 40 years for possession of mari&para;<br>juana with intent to distribute and distribution of mari&para;<br>juana, Hutto v. Davis, 454 U. S. 370 (1982) (per curiam).&para;<br>The controlling opinion in Harmelin explained its ap&para;<br>proach for determining whether a sentence for a term of&para;<br>years is grossly disproportionate for a particular defen&para;<br>dant’s crime. A court must begin by comparing the gravity&para;<br>of the offense and the severity of the sentence. 501 U. S.,&para;<br>at 1005 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). “[I]n the rare case in&para;<br>which [this] threshold comparison . . . leads to an infer&para;<br>ence of gross disproportionality” the court should then&para;<br>compare the defendant’s sentence with the sentences&para;<br>received by other offenders in the same jurisdiction and&para;<br>with the sentences imposed for the same crime in other&para;<br>jurisdictions. Ibid. If this comparative analysis “vali&para;<br>date[s] an initial judgment that [the] sentence is grossly&para;<br>disproportionate,” the sentence is cruel and unusual. Ibid.&para;<br>The second classification of cases has used categorical&para;<br>rules to define Eighth Amendment standards. The previ&para;<br>ous cases in this classification involved the death penalty.&para;<br>The classification in turn consists of two subsets, one&para;<br>considering the nature of the offense, the other consider&para;<br>ing the characteristics of the offender. With respect to the&para;<br>nature of the offense, the Court has concluded that capital&para;<br>punishment is impermissible for nonhomicide crimes&para;<br>against individuals. Kennedy, supra, at __ (slip op., at 28);&para;<br>see also Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982); Coker v.&para;<br>Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977). In cases turning on the&para;<br>characteristics of the offender, the Court has adopted&para;<br>categorical rules prohibiting the death penalty for defen&para;<br>dants who committed their crimes before the age of 18,&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>to opinion&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>of the of&para;<br>Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.

S. 815 (1988).&para;<br>In the cases adopting categorical rules the Court has&para;<br>taken the following approach. The Court first considers&para;<br>“objective indicia of society’s standards, as expressed in&para;<br>legislative enactments and state practice” to determine&para;<br>whether there is a national consensus against the sentenc&para;<br>ing practice at issue. Roper, supra, at 563. Next, guided&para;<br>by “the standards elaborated by controlling precedents&para;<br>and by the Court’s own understanding and interpretation&para;<br>of the Eighth Amendment’s text, history, meaning, and&para;<br>purpose,” Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10), the&para;<br>Court must determine in the exercise of its own inde&para;<br>pendent judgment whether the punishment in question&para;<br>violates the Constitution. Roper, supra, at 564.&para;<br>The present case involves an issue the Court has not&para;<br>considered previously: a categorical challenge to a term-of&para;<br>years sentence. The approach in cases such as Harmelin&para;<br>and Ewing is suited for considering a gross proportionality&para;<br>challenge to a particular defendant’s sentence, but here a&para;<br>sentencing practice itself is in question. This case impli&para;<br>cates a particular type of sentence as it applies to an&para;<br>entire class of offenders who have committed a range of&para;<br>crimes. As a result, a threshold comparison between the&para;<br>severity of the penalty and the gravity of the crime does&para;<br>not advance the analysis. Here, in addressing the ques&para;<br>tion presented, the appropriate analysis is the one used in&para;<br>cases that involved the categorical approach, specifically&para;<br>Atkins, Roper, and Kennedy.&para;<br>III&para;<br>A&para;<br>The analysis begins with objective indicia of national&para;<br>consensus. “[T]he ‘clearest and most reliable objective&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 331 (1989)). Six&para;<br>jurisdictions do not allow life without parole sentences for&para;<br>any juvenile offenders. See Appendix, infra, Part III.&para;<br>Seven jurisdictions permit life without parole for juvenile&para;<br>offenders, but only for homicide crimes. Id., Part II.&para;<br>Thirty-seven States as well as the District of Columbia&para;<br>permit sentences of life without parole for a juvenile non&para;<br>homicide offender in some circumstances. Id., Part I.&para;<br>Federal law also allows for the possibility of life without&para;<br>parole for offenders as young as 13. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§2241 (2006 ed. and Supp. II), 5032 (2006 ed.). Relying&para;<br>on this metric, the State and its amici argue that there is&para;<br>no national consensus against the sentencing practice at&para;<br>issue.&para;<br>This argument is incomplete and unavailing. “There are&para;<br>measures of consensus other than legislation.” Kennedy,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 22). Actual sentencing practices&para;<br>are an important part of the Court’s inquiry into consen&para;<br>sus. See Enmund, supra, at 794–796; Thompson, supra,&para;<br>at 831–832 (plurality opinion); Atkins, supra, at 316;&para;<br>Roper, supra, at 564–565; Kennedy, supra, at ___ (slip op.,&para;<br>at 22–23). Here, an examination of actual sentencing&para;<br>practices in jurisdictions where the sentence in question is&para;<br>permitted by statute discloses a consensus against its use.&para;<br>Although these statutory schemes contain no explicit&para;<br>prohibition on sentences of life without parole for juvenile&para;<br>nonhomicide offenders, those sentences are most infre&para;<br>quent. According to a recent study, nationwide there are&para;<br>only 109 juvenile offenders serving sentences of life with&para;<br>out parole for nonhomicide offenses. See P. Annino, D.&para;<br>Rasmussen, &amp; C. Rice, Juvenile Life without Parole for&para;<br>Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation 2&para;<br>(Sept. 14, 2009) (hereinafter Annino).&para;<br>The State contends that this study’s tally is inaccurate&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>to opinion&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>of the of&para;<br>Court&para;<br>&para;<br>because it does not count juvenile offenders who were&para;<br>convicted of both a homicide and a nonhomicide offense,&para;<br>even when the offender received a life without parole&para;<br>sentence for the nonhomicide. See Brief for Respondent&para;<br>34; Tr. of Oral Arg. in Sullivan v. Florida, O. T. 2009,&para;<br>No. 08–7621, pp. 28–31. This distinction is unpersuasive.&para;<br>Juvenile offenders who committed both homicide and&para;<br>nonhomicide crimes present a different situation for a&para;<br>sentencing judge than juvenile offenders who committed&para;<br>no homicide. It is difficult to say that a defendant who&para;<br>receives a life sentence on a nonhomicide offense but who&para;<br>was at the same time convicted of homicide is not in some&para;<br>sense being punished in part for the homicide when the&para;<br>judge makes the sentencing determination. The instant&para;<br>case concerns only those juvenile offenders sentenced&para;<br>to life without parole solely for a nonhomicide offense.&para;<br>Florida further criticizes this study because the authors&para;<br>were unable to obtain complete information on some&para;<br>States and because the study was not peer reviewed. See&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 40. The State does not, however,&para;<br>provide any data of its own. Although in the first instance&para;<br>it is for the litigants to provide data to aid the Court, we&para;<br>have been able to supplement the study’s findings. The&para;<br>study’s authors were not able to obtain a definitive tally&para;<br>for Nevada, Utah, or Virginia. See Annino 11–13. Our&para;<br>research shows that Nevada has five juvenile nonhomicide&para;<br>offenders serving life without parole sentences, Utah has&para;<br>none, and Virginia has eight.

See Stogsdill, Dela&para;<br>ware County Teen Sentenced in Rape, Assault Case, Tulsa&para;<br>World, May 4, 2010, p. A12.&para;<br>Thus, adding the individuals counted by the study to&para;<br>those we have been able to locate independently, there are&para;<br>123 juvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life without&para;<br>parole sentences. A significant majority of those, 77 in&para;<br>total, are serving sentences imposed in Florida. Annino 2.&para;<br>The other 46 are imprisoned in just 10 States—California,&para;<br>Delaware, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Ne&para;<br>vada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Virginia. Id., at 14;&para;<br>supra, at 12–13; Letter from Thomas P.

S. Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), to&para;<br>Supreme Court Library (Apr. 9, 2010) (available in Clerk&para;<br>of Court’s case file). Thus, only 11 jurisdictions nation&para;<br>wide in fact impose life without parole sentences on juve&para;<br>nile nonhomicide offenders—and most of those do so quite&para;<br>rarely—while 26 States, the District of Columbia, and the&para;<br>Federal Government do not impose them despite statutory&para;<br>authorization.*&para;<br>The numbers cited above reflect all current convicts in a&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* When issued, the Court’s opinion relied on a report from the BOP&para;<br>stating that there are six juvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life&para;<br>without parole in the federal system. The Acting Solicitor General&para;<br>subsequently informed the Court that further review revealed that&para;<br>none of the six prisoners referred to in the earlier BOP report is serving&para;<br>a life without parole sentence solely for a juvenile nonhomicide crime&para;<br>completed before the age of 18. Letter from Neal Kumar Katyal, Acting&para;<br>Solicitor General, to William K. Suter, Clerk of Court (May 24, 2010)&para;<br>(available in Clerk of Court’s case file). The letter further stated that&para;<br>the Government was not aware of any other federal prisoners serving&para;<br>life without parole sentences solely for juvenile nonhomicide crimes.&para;<br>Ibid. The opinion was amended in light of this new information.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>to opinion&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>of the of&para;<br>Court&para;<br>&para;<br>jurisdiction’s penal system, regardless of when they were&para;<br>convicted. It becomes all the more clear how rare these&para;<br>sentences are, even within the jurisdictions that do some&para;<br>times impose them, when one considers that a juvenile&para;<br>sentenced to life without parole is likely to live in prison&para;<br>for decades. Thus, these statistics likely reflect nearly all&para;<br>juvenile nonhomicide offenders who have received a life&para;<br>without parole sentence stretching back many years. It is&para;<br>not certain that this opinion has identified every juvenile&para;<br>nonhomicide offender nationwide serving a life without&para;<br>parole sentence, for the statistics are not precise. The&para;<br>available data, nonetheless, are sufficient to demonstrate&para;<br>how rarely these sentences are imposed even if there are&para;<br>isolated cases that have not been included in the presenta&para;<br>tions of the parties or the analysis of the Court.&para;<br>It must be acknowledged that in terms of absolute num&para;<br>bers juvenile life without parole sentences for nonhomi&para;<br>cides are more common than the sentencing practices at&para;<br>issue in some of this Court’s other Eighth Amendment&para;<br>cases. See, e.g., Enmund, 458 U. S., at 794 (only six exe&para;<br>cutions of nontriggerman felony murderers between 1954&para;<br>and 1982) Atkins, 536 U. S., at 316 (only five executions of&para;<br>mentally retarded defendants in 13-year period). This&para;<br>contrast can be instructive, however, if attention is first&para;<br>given to the base number of certain types of offenses. For&para;<br>example, in the year 2007 (the most recent year for which&para;<br>statistics are available), a total of 13,480 persons, adult&para;<br>and juvenile, were arrested for homicide crimes. That&para;<br>same year, 57,600 juveniles were arrested for aggravated&para;<br>assault; 3,580 for forcible rape; 34,500 for robbery; 81,900&para;<br>for burglary; 195,700 for drug offenses; and 7,200 for&para;<br>arson. See Dept. of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and&para;<br>Delinquency Prevention, Statistical Briefing Book, online&para;<br>at http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/ojstatbb/ (as visited May 14, 2010,&para;<br>and available in Clerk of Court’s case file). Although it is&para;<br>not certain how many of these numerous juvenile offend&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>to opinion&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>of the of&para;<br>Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ers were eligible for life without parole sentences, the&para;<br>comparison suggests that in proportion to the opportuni&para;<br>ties for its imposition, life without parole sentences for&para;<br>juveniles convicted of nonhomicide crimes is as rare as&para;<br>other sentencing practices found to be cruel and unusual.&para;<br>The evidence of consensus is not undermined by the fact&para;<br>that many jurisdictions do not prohibit life without parole&para;<br>for juvenile nonhomicide offenders. The Court confronted&para;<br>a similar situation in Thompson, where a plurality con&para;<br>cluded that the death penalty for offenders younger than&para;<br>16 was unconstitutional. A number of States then allowed&para;<br>the juvenile death penalty if one considered the statutory&para;<br>scheme. As is the case here, those States authorized the&para;<br>transfer of some juvenile offenders to adult court; and at&para;<br>that point there was no statutory differentiation between&para;<br>adults and juveniles with respect to authorized penalties.&para;<br>The plurality concluded that the transfer laws show “that&para;<br>the States consider 15-year-olds to be old enough to be&para;<br>tried in criminal court for serious crimes (or too old to be&para;<br>dealt with effectively in juvenile court), but tells us noth&para;<br>ing about the judgment these States have made regarding&para;<br>the appropriate punishment for such youthful offenders.”&para;<br>487 U. S., at 826, n. 24. Justice O’Connor, concurring in&para;<br>the judgment, took a similar view. Id., at 850 (“When a&para;<br>legislature provides for some 15-year-olds to be processed&para;<br>through the adult criminal justice system, and capital&para;<br>punishment is available for adults in that jurisdiction, the&para;<br>death penalty becomes at least theoretically applicable to&para;<br>such defendants. . . . [H]owever, it does not necessarily&para;<br>follow that the legislatures in those jurisdictions have&para;<br>deliberately concluded that it would be appropriate”).&para;<br>The same reasoning obtains here. Many States have&para;<br>chosen to move away from juvenile court systems and to&para;<br>allow juveniles to be transferred to, or charged directly in,&para;<br>adult court under certain circumstances. Once in adult&para;<br>court, a juvenile offender may receive the same sentence&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>to opinion&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>of the of&para;<br>Court&para;<br>&para;<br>as would be given to an adult offender, including a life&para;<br>without parole sentence. But the fact that transfer and&para;<br>direct charging laws make life without parole possible for&para;<br>some juvenile nonhomicide offenders does not justify a&para;<br>judgment that many States intended to subject such of&para;<br>fenders to life without parole sentences.&para;<br>For example, under Florida law a child of any age can be&para;<br>prosecuted as an adult for certain crimes and can be sen&para;<br>tenced to life without parole. The State acknowledged at&para;<br>oral argument that even a 5-year-old, theoretically, could&para;<br>receive such a sentence under the letter of the law. See&para;<br>Tr. of Oral Arg. 36–37. All would concede this to be unre&para;<br>alistic, but the example underscores that the statutory&para;<br>eligibility of a juvenile offender for life without parole does&para;<br>not indicate that the penalty has been endorsed through&para;<br>deliberate, express, and full legislative consideration.&para;<br>Similarly, the many States that allow life without parole&para;<br>for juvenile nonhomicide offenders but do not impose the&para;<br>punishment should not be treated as if they have ex&para;<br>pressed the view that the sentence is appropriate. The&para;<br>sentencing practice now under consideration is exceed&para;<br>ingly rare. And “it is fair to say that a national consensus&para;<br>has developed against it.” Atkins, supra, at 316.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Community consensus, while “entitled to great weight,”&para;<br>is not itself determinative of whether a punishment is&para;<br>cruel and unusual. Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>24). In accordance with the constitutional design, “the&para;<br>task of interpreting the Eighth Amendment remains our&para;<br>responsibility.” Roper, 543 U. S., at 575. The judicial&para;<br>exercise of independent judgment requires consideration&para;<br>of the culpability of the offenders at issue in light of their&para;<br>crimes and characteristics, along with the severity of the&para;<br>punishment in question. Id., at 568; Kennedy, supra, at&para;<br>___ (slip op., at 27–28); cf. Solem, 463 U. S., at 292. In this&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

S., at 569. As compared to adults,&para;<br>juveniles have a “ ‘lack of maturity and an underdeveloped&para;<br>sense of responsibility’ ”; they “are more vulnerable or&para;<br>susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures,&para;<br>including peer pressure”; and their characters are “not as&para;<br>well formed.” Id., at 569–570. These salient characteris&para;<br>tics mean that “[i]t is difficult even for expert psycholo&para;<br>gists to differentiate between the juvenile offender whose&para;<br>crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and&para;<br>the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable&para;<br>corruption.” Id., at 573. Accordingly, “juvenile offenders&para;<br>cannot with reliability be classified among the worst of&para;<br>fenders.” Id., at 569. A juvenile is not absolved of respon&para;<br>sibility for his actions, but his transgression “is not as&para;<br>morally reprehensible as that of an adult.” Thompson,&para;<br>supra, at 835 (plurality opinion).&para;<br>No recent data provide reason to reconsider the Court’s&para;<br>observations in Roper about the nature of juveniles. As&para;<br>petitioner’s amici point out, developments in psychology&para;<br>and brain science continue to show fundamental differ&para;<br>ences between juvenile and adult minds. For example,&para;<br>parts of the brain involved in behavior control continue to&para;<br>mature through late adolescence. See Brief for American&para;<br>Medical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 16–24; Brief for&para;<br>American Psychological Association et al. as Amici Curiae&para;<br>22–27. Juveniles are more capable of change than are&para;<br>adults, and their actions are less likely to be evidence of&para;<br>“irretrievably depraved character” than are the actions of&para;<br>adults. Roper, 543 U. S., at 570. It remains true that&para;<br>“[f]rom a moral standpoint it would be misguided to&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v.

These matters relate to the&para;<br>status of the offenders in question; and it is relevant to&para;<br>consider next the nature of the offenses to which this&para;<br>harsh penalty might apply.&para;<br>The Court has recognized that defendants who do not&para;<br>kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are&para;<br>categorically less deserving of the most serious forms of&para;<br>punishment than are murderers. Kennedy, supra; En&para;<br>mund, 458 U. S. 782; Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S. 137&para;<br>(1987); Coker, 433 U. S. 584.

Solem, 463 U. S., at 300–301. As one court&para;<br>observed in overturning a life without parole sentence for&para;<br>a juvenile defendant, this sentence “means denial of hope;&para;<br>it means that good behavior and character improvement&para;<br>are immaterial; it means that whatever the future might&para;<br>hold in store for the mind and spirit of [the convict], he&para;<br>will remain in prison for the rest of his days.” Naovarath&para;<br>v. State, 105 Nev. 525, 526, 779 P. 2d 944 (1989).&para;<br>The Court has recognized the severity of sentences that&para;<br>deny convicts the possibility of parole. In Rummel, 445&para;<br>U. S. 263, the Court rejected an Eighth Amendment chal&para;<br>lenge to a life sentence for a defendant’s third nonviolent&para;<br>felony but stressed that the sentence gave the defendant&para;<br>the possibility of parole. Noting that “parole is an estab&para;<br>lished variation on imprisonment of convicted criminals,”&para;<br>it was evident that an analysis of the petitioner’s sentence&para;<br>“could hardly ignore the possibility that he will not actu&para;<br>ally be imprisoned for the rest of his life.” Id., at 280–281&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted). And in Solem, the&para;<br>only previous case striking down a sentence for a term of&para;<br>years as grossly disproportionate, the defendant’s sentence&para;<br>was deemed “far more severe than the life sentence we&para;<br>considered in Rummel,” because it did not give the defen&para;<br>dant the possibility of parole. 463 U.

Harmelin, supra, at 996 (“In some cases&para;<br>. . . there will be negligible difference between life without&para;<br>parole and other sentences of imprisonment—for example,&para;<br>. . . a lengthy term sentence without eligibility for parole,&para;<br>given to a 65-year-old man”). This reality cannot be&para;<br>ignored.&para;<br>The penological justifications for the sentencing practice&para;<br>are also relevant to the analysis. Kennedy, supra, at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 30–36); Roper, 543 U. S., at 571–572; Atkins,&para;<br>supra, at 318–320. Criminal punishment can have differ&para;<br>ent goals, and choosing among them is within a legisla&para;<br>ture’s discretion. See Harmelin, supra, at 999 (opinion of&para;<br>KENNEDY, J.) (“[T]he Eighth Amendment does not man&para;<br>date adoption of any one penological theory”). It does not&para;<br>follow, however, that the purposes and effects of penal&para;<br>sanctions are irrelevant to the determination of Eighth&para;<br>Amendment restrictions. A sentence lacking any legiti&para;<br>mate penological justification is by its nature dispropor&para;<br>tionate to the offense. With respect to life without parole&para;<br>for juvenile nonhomicide offenders, none of the goals of&para;<br>penal sanctions that have been recognized as legitimate—&para;<br>retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation,&para;<br>see Ewing, 538 U. S., at 25 (plurality opinion)—provides&para;<br>an adequate justification.&para;<br>Retribution is a legitimate reason to punish, but it&para;<br>cannot support the sentence at issue here. Society is&para;<br>entitled to impose severe sanctions on a juvenile nonhomi&para;<br>cide offender to express its condemnation of the crime and&para;<br>to seek restoration of the moral imbalance caused by the&para;<br>offense. But “[t]he heart of the retribution rationale is&para;<br>that a criminal sentence must be directly related to the&para;<br>personal culpability of the criminal offender.” Tison, 481&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

And as Roper observed, “[w]hether viewed&para;<br>as an attempt to express the community’s moral outrage&para;<br>or as an attempt to right the balance for the wrong to the&para;<br>victim, the case for retribution is not as strong with a&para;<br>minor as with an adult.” 543 U. S., at 571. The case&para;<br>becomes even weaker with respect to a juvenile who did&para;<br>not commit homicide. Roper found that “[r]etribution is&para;<br>not proportional if the law’s most severe penalty is im&para;<br>posed” on the juvenile murderer. Ibid. The considerations&para;<br>underlying that holding support as well the conclusion&para;<br>that retribution does not justify imposing the second most&para;<br>severe penalty on the less culpable juvenile nonhomicide&para;<br>offender.&para;<br>Deterrence does not suffice to justify the sentence ei&para;<br>ther. Roper noted that “the same characteristics that&para;<br>render juveniles less culpable than adults suggest . . . that&para;<br>juveniles will be less susceptible to deterrence.” Ibid.&para;<br>Because juveniles’ “lack of maturity and underdeveloped&para;<br>sense of responsibility . . . often result in impetuous and&para;<br>ill-considered actions and decisions,” Johnson v. Texas,&para;<br>509 U. S. 350, 367 (1993), they are less likely to take a&para;<br>possible punishment into consideration when making&para;<br>decisions. This is particularly so when that punishment is&para;<br>rarely imposed. That the sentence deters in a few cases is&para;<br>perhaps plausible, but “[t]his argument does not overcome&para;<br>other objections.” Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at&para;<br>31). Even if the punishment has some connection to a&para;<br>valid penological goal, it must be shown that the punish&para;<br>ment is not grossly disproportionate in light of the justifi&para;<br>cation offered. Here, in light of juvenile nonhomicide&para;<br>offenders’ diminished moral responsibility, any limited&para;<br>deterrent effect provided by life without parole is not&para;<br>enough to justify the sentence.&para;<br>Incapacitation, a third legitimate reason for imprison&para;<br>ment, does not justify the life without parole sentence in&para;<br>question here. Recidivism is a serious risk to public&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>to opinion&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>of the of&para;<br>Court&para;<br>&para;<br>safety, and so incapacitation is an important goal. See&para;<br>Ewing, supra, at 26 (plurality opinion) (statistics show 67&para;<br>percent of former inmates released from state prisons are&para;<br>charged with at least one serious new crime within three&para;<br>years). But while incapacitation may be a legitimate&para;<br>penological goal sufficient to justify life without parole in&para;<br>other contexts, it is inadequate to justify that punishment&para;<br>for juveniles who did not commit homicide. To justify life&para;<br>without parole on the assumption that the juvenile of&para;<br>fender forever will be a danger to society requires the&para;<br>sentencer to make a judgment that the juvenile is incorri&para;<br>gible. The characteristics of juveniles make that judgment&para;<br>questionable. “It is difficult even for expert psychologists&para;<br>to differentiate between the juvenile offender whose crime&para;<br>reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and the&para;<br>rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable&para;<br>corruption.” Roper, supra, at 573. As one court concluded&para;<br>in a challenge to a life without parole sentence for a 14&para;<br>year-old, “incorrigibility is inconsistent with youth.”&para;<br>Workman v. Commonwealth, 429 S. W. 2d 374, 378 (Ky.&para;<br>App. 1968).&para;<br>Here one cannot dispute that this defendant posed an&para;<br>immediate risk, for he had committed, we can assume,&para;<br>serious crimes early in his term of supervised release and&para;<br>despite his own assurances of reform. Graham deserved&para;<br>to be separated from society for some time in order to&para;<br>prevent what the trial court described as an “escalating&para;<br>pattern of criminal conduct,” App. 394, but it does not&para;<br>follow that he would be a risk to society for the rest of his&para;<br>life. Even if the State’s judgment that Graham was incor&para;<br>rigible were later corroborated by prison misbehavior or&para;<br>failure to mature, the sentence was still disproportionate&para;<br>because that judgment was made at the outset. A life&para;<br>without parole sentence improperly denies the juvenile&para;<br>offender a chance to demonstrate growth and maturity.&para;<br>Incapacitation cannot override all other considerations,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

See Solem, 463 U. S., at&para;<br>300; Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 363 (1989).&para;<br>The concept of rehabilitation is imprecise; and its utility&para;<br>and proper implementation are the subject of a substan&para;<br>tial, dynamic field of inquiry and dialogue. See, e.g., Cul&para;<br>len &amp; Gendreau, Assessing Correctional Rehabilitation:&para;<br>Policy, Practice, and Prospects, 3 Criminal Justice 2000,&para;<br>pp. 119–133 (2000) (describing scholarly debates regarding&para;<br>the effectiveness of rehabilitation over the last several&para;<br>decades). It is for legislatures to determine what rehabili&para;<br>tative techniques are appropriate and effective.&para;<br>A sentence of life imprisonment without parole, how&para;<br>ever, cannot be justified by the goal of rehabilitation. The&para;<br>penalty forswears altogether the rehabilitative ideal. By&para;<br>denying the defendant the right to reenter the community,&para;<br>the State makes an irrevocable judgment about that per&para;<br>son’s value and place in society. This judgment is not&para;<br>appropriate in light of a juvenile nonhomicide offender’s&para;<br>capacity for change and limited moral culpability. A&para;<br>State’s rejection of rehabilitation, moreover, goes beyond a&para;<br>mere expressive judgment. As one amicus notes, defen&para;<br>dants serving life without parole sentences are often de&para;<br>nied access to vocational training and other rehabilitative&para;<br>services that are available to other inmates. See Brief for&para;<br>Sentencing Project as Amicus Curiae 11–13. For juvenile&para;<br>offenders, who are most in need of and receptive to reha&para;<br>bilitation, see Brief for J. Lawrence Aber et al. as Amici&para;<br>Curiae 28–31 (hereinafter Aber Brief), the absence of&para;<br>rehabilitative opportunities or treatment makes the dis&para;<br>proportionality of the sentence all the more evident.&para;<br>In sum, penological theory is not adequate to justify life&para;<br>without parole for juvenile nonhomicide offenders. This&para;<br>determination; the limited culpability of juvenile non&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>to opinion&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>of the of&para;<br>Court&para;<br>&para;<br>homicide offenders; and the severity of life without parole&para;<br>sentences all lead to the conclusion that the sentencing&para;<br>practice under consideration is cruel and unusual. This&para;<br>Court now holds that for a juvenile offender who did not&para;<br>commit homicide the Eighth Amendment forbids the&para;<br>sentence of life without parole. This clear line is necessary&para;<br>to prevent the possibility that life without parole sen&para;<br>tences will be imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders&para;<br>who are not sufficiently culpable to merit that punish&para;<br>ment. Because “[t]he age of 18 is the point where society&para;<br>draws the line for many purposes between childhood and&para;<br>adulthood,” those who were below that age when the&para;<br>offense was committed may not be sentenced to life with&para;<br>out parole for a nonhomicide crime. Roper, 543 U. S., at&para;<br>574.&para;<br>A State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to&para;<br>a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime.&para;<br>What the State must do, however, is give defendants like&para;<br>Graham some meaningful opportunity to obtain release&para;<br>based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. It is&para;<br>for the State, in the first instance, to explore the means&para;<br>and mechanisms for compliance. It bears emphasis, how&para;<br>ever, that while the Eighth Amendment forbids a State&para;<br>from imposing a life without parole sentence on a juvenile&para;<br>nonhomicide offender, it does not require the State to&para;<br>release that offender during his natural life. Those who&para;<br>commit truly horrifying crimes as juveniles may turn out&para;<br>to be irredeemable, and thus deserving of incarceration for&para;<br>the duration of their lives. The Eighth Amendment does&para;<br>not foreclose the possibility that persons convicted of&para;<br>nonhomicide crimes committed before adulthood will&para;<br>remain behind bars for life. It does forbid States from&para;<br>making the judgment at the outset that those offenders&para;<br>never will be fit to reenter society.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Two alternative approaches are not adequate&para;<br>to address the relevant constitutional concerns. First, the&para;<br>State argues that the laws of Florida and other States&para;<br>governing criminal procedure take sufficient account of&para;<br>the age of a juvenile offender. Here, Florida notes that&para;<br>under its law prosecutors are required to charge 16- and&para;<br>17-year-old offenders as adults only for certain serious&para;<br>felonies; that prosecutors have discretion to charge those&para;<br>offenders as adults for other felonies; and that prosecutors&para;<br>may not charge nonrecidivist 16- and 17-year-old offenders&para;<br>as adults for misdemeanors. Brief for Respondent 54&para;<br>(citing Fla. Stat. §985.227 (2003)). The State also stresses&para;<br>that “in only the narrowest of circumstances” does Florida&para;<br>law impose no age limit whatsoever for prosecuting juve&para;<br>niles in adult court. Brief for Respondent 54.&para;<br>Florida is correct to say that state laws requiring con&para;<br>sideration of a defendant’s age in charging decisions are&para;<br>salutary. An offender’s age is relevant to the Eighth&para;<br>Amendment, and criminal procedure laws that fail to take&para;<br>defendants’ youthfulness into account at all would be&para;<br>flawed. Florida, like other States, has made substantial&para;<br>efforts to enact comprehensive rules governing the treat&para;<br>ment of youthful offenders by its criminal justice system.&para;<br>See generally Fla. Stat. §958 et seq. (2007).&para;<br>The provisions the State notes are, nonetheless, by&para;<br>themselves insufficient to address the constitutional con&para;<br>cerns at issue. Nothing in Florida’s laws prevents its&para;<br>courts from sentencing a juvenile nonhomicide offender to&para;<br>life without parole based on a subjective judgment that the&para;<br>defendant’s crimes demonstrate an “irretrievably de&para;<br>praved character.” Roper, supra, at 570. This is inconsis&para;<br>tent with the Eighth Amendment. Specific cases are&para;<br>illustrative. In Graham’s case the sentencing judge de&para;<br>cided to impose life without parole—a sentence greater&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Appendix&para;<br>to opinion&para;<br>the Court&para;<br>Opinion&para;<br>of the of&para;<br>Court&para;<br>&para;<br>than that requested by the prosecutor—for Graham’s&para;<br>armed burglary conviction. The judge did so because he&para;<br>concluded that Graham was incorrigible: “[Y]ou decided&para;<br>that this is how you were going to lead your life and that&para;<br>there is nothing that we can do for you. . . . We can’t do&para;<br>anything to deter you.” App. 394.&para;<br>Another example comes from Sullivan v. Florida,&para;<br>No. 08–7621. Sullivan was argued the same day as this&para;<br>case, but the Court has now dismissed the writ of certio&para;<br>rari in Sullivan as improvidently granted. Post, p. ___.&para;<br>The facts, however, demonstrate the flaws of Florida’s&para;<br>system. The petitioner, Joe Sullivan, was prosecuted as&para;<br>an adult for a sexual assault committed when he was 13&para;<br>years old. Noting Sullivan’s past encounters with the law,&para;<br>the sentencing judge concluded that, although Sullivan&para;<br>had been “given opportunity after opportunity to upright&para;<br>himself and take advantage of the second and third&para;<br>chances he’s been given,” he had demonstrated himself to&para;<br>be unwilling to follow the law and needed to be kept away&para;<br>from society for the duration of his life. Brief for Respon&para;<br>dent in Sullivan v. Florida, O. T. 2009, No. 08–7621, p. 6.&para;<br>The judge sentenced Sullivan to life without parole. As&para;<br>these examples make clear, existing state laws, allowing&para;<br>the imposition of these sentences based only on a discre&para;<br>tionary, subjective judgment by a judge or jury that the&para;<br>offender is irredeemably depraved, are insufficient to&para;<br>prevent the possibility that the offender will receive a life&para;<br>without parole sentence for which he or she lacks the&para;<br>moral culpability.&para;<br>Another possible approach would be to hold that the&para;<br>Eighth Amendment requires courts to take the offender’s&para;<br>age into consideration as part of a case-specific gross&para;<br>disproportionality inquiry, weighing it against the seri&para;<br>ousness of the crime. This approach would allow courts to&para;<br>account for factual differences between cases and to im&para;<br>pose life without parole sentences for particularly heinous&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Few, perhaps no, judicial responsibilities are more&para;<br>difficult than sentencing. The task is usually undertaken&para;<br>by trial judges who seek with diligence and professional&para;<br>ism to take account of the human existence of the offender&para;<br>and the just demands of a wronged society.&para;<br>The case-by-case approach to sentencing must, however,&para;<br>be confined by some boundaries. The dilemma of juvenile&para;<br>sentencing demonstrates this. For even if we were to&para;<br>assume that some juvenile nonhomicide offenders might&para;<br>have “sufficient psychological maturity, and at the same&para;<br>time demonstrat[e] sufficient depravity,” Roper, 543 U. S.,&para;<br>at 572, to merit a life without parole sentence, it does not&para;<br>follow that courts taking a case-by-case proportionality&para;<br>approach could with sufficient accuracy distinguish the&para;<br>few incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that&para;<br>have the capacity for change. Roper rejected the argument&para;<br>that the Eighth Amendment required only that juries be&para;<br>told they must consider the defendant’s age as a mitigat&para;<br>ing factor in sentencing. The Court concluded that an&para;<br>“unacceptable likelihood exists that the brutality or cold&para;<br>blooded nature of any particular crime would overpower&para;<br>mitigating arguments based on youth as a matter of&para;<br>course, even where the juvenile offender’s objective imma&para;<br>turity, vulnerability, and lack of true depravity should&para;<br>require a sentence less severe than death.” Id., at 573.&para;<br>Here, as with the death penalty, “[t]he differences between&para;<br>juvenile and adult offenders are too marked and well&para;<br>understood to risk allowing a youthful person to receive” a&para;<br>sentence of life without parole for a nonhomicide crime&para;<br>“despite insufficient culpability.” Id., at 572–573.&para;<br>Another problem with a case-by-case approach is that it&para;<br>does not take account of special difficulties encountered by&para;<br>counsel in juvenile representation. As some amici note,&para;<br>the features that distinguish juveniles from adults also&para;<br>put them at a significant disadvantage in criminal pro&para;<br>ceedings. Juveniles mistrust adults and have limited&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v.

Rev. 245, 272–273 (2005). Diffi&para;<br>culty in weighing long-term consequences; a corresponding&para;<br>impulsiveness; and reluctance to trust defense counsel&para;<br>seen as part of the adult world a rebellious youth rejects,&para;<br>all can lead to poor decisions by one charged with a juve&para;<br>nile offense. Aber Brief 35. These factors are likely to&para;<br>impair the quality of a juvenile defendant’s representa&para;<br>tion. Cf. Atkins, 536 U. S., at 320 (“Mentally retarded&para;<br>defendants may be less able to give meaningful assistance&para;<br>to their counsel”). A categorical rule avoids the risk that,&para;<br>as a result of these difficulties, a court or jury will errone&para;<br>ously conclude that a particular juvenile is sufficiently&para;<br>culpable to deserve life without parole for a nonhomicide.&para;<br>Finally, a categorical rule gives all juvenile nonhomicide&para;<br>offenders a chance to demonstrate maturity and reform.&para;<br>The juvenile should not be deprived of the opportunity to&para;<br>achieve maturity of judgment and self-recognition of hu&para;<br>man worth and potential. In Roper, that deprivation&para;<br>resulted from an execution that brought life to its end.&para;<br>Here, though by a different dynamic, the same concerns&para;<br>apply. Life in prison without the possibility of parole gives&para;<br>no chance for fulfillment outside prison walls, no chance&para;<br>for reconciliation with society, no hope. Maturity can lead&para;<br>to that considered reflection which is the foundation for&para;<br>remorse, renewal, and rehabilitation. A young person who&para;<br>knows that he or she has no chance to leave prison before&para;<br>life’s end has little incentive to become a responsible indi&para;<br>vidual.

The State has denied him any chance to&para;<br>later demonstrate that he is fit to rejoin society based&para;<br>solely on a nonhomicide crime that he committed while he&para;<br>was a child in the eyes of the law. This the Eighth&para;<br>Amendment does not permit.&para;<br>D&para;<br>There is support for our conclusion in the fact that, in&para;<br>continuing to impose life without parole sentences on&para;<br>juveniles who did not commit homicide, the United States&para;<br>adheres to a sentencing practice rejected the world over.&para;<br>This observation does not control our decision.

See&para;<br>M. Leighton &amp; C. de la Vega, Sentencing Our Children to&para;<br>Die in Prison: Global Law and Practice 4 (2007). An up&para;<br>dated version of the study concluded that Israel’s “laws&para;<br>allow for parole review of juvenile offenders serving life&para;<br>terms,” but expressed reservations about how that parole&para;<br>review is implemented.

But even if&para;<br>Israel is counted as allowing life without parole for juve&para;<br>nile offenders, that nation does not appear to impose that&para;<br>sentence for nonhomicide crimes; all of the seven Israeli&para;<br>prisoners whom commentators have identified as serving&para;<br>life sentences for juvenile crimes were convicted of homi&para;<br>cide or attempted homicide.

Instead, my analysis is based on an applica&para;<br>tion of this Court’s precedents, in particular (1) our cases&para;<br>requiring “narrow proportionality” review of noncapital&para;<br>sentences and (2) our conclusion in Roper v. Simmons, 543&para;<br>U. S. 551 (2005), that juvenile offenders are generally less&para;<br>culpable than adults who commit the same crimes.&para;<br>These cases expressly allow courts addressing allega&para;<br>tions that a noncapital sentence violates the Eighth&para;<br>Amendment to consider the particular defendant and&para;<br>particular crime at issue. The standards for relief under&para;<br>these precedents are rigorous, and should be. But here&para;<br>Graham’s juvenile status—together with the nature of his&para;<br>criminal conduct and the extraordinarily severe punish&para;<br>ment imposed—lead me to conclude that his sentence of&para;<br>life without parole is unconstitutional.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Our Court has struggled with whether and how to apply&para;<br>the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause to sentences&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>for noncapital crimes. Some of my colleagues have raised&para;<br>serious and thoughtful questions about whether, as an&para;<br>original matter, the Constitution was understood to re&para;<br>quire any degree of proportionality between noncapital&para;<br>offenses and their corresponding punishments. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 962–994 (1991)&para;<br>(principal opinion of SCALIA, J.); post, at 3–5, and n. 1&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., dissenting). Neither party here asks us to&para;<br>reexamine our precedents requiring such proportionality,&para;<br>however, and so I approach this case by trying to apply&para;<br>our past decisions to the facts at hand.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Graham’s case arises at the intersection of two lines of&para;<br>Eighth Amendment precedent. The first consists of deci&para;<br>sions holding that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments&para;<br>Clause embraces a “narrow proportionality principle” that&para;<br>we apply, on a case-by-case basis, when asked to review&para;<br>noncapital sentences. Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 72&para;<br>(2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); Solem v. Helm,&para;<br>463 U. S. 277, 290 (1983); Ewing v. California, 538 U. S.&para;<br>11, 20 (2003) (plurality opinion); Harmelin, supra, at 996–&para;<br>997 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in&para;<br>judgment). This “narrow proportionality principle” does&para;<br>not grant judges blanket authority to second-guess deci&para;<br>sions made by legislatures or sentencing courts. On the&para;<br>contrary, a reviewing court will only “rarely” need “to&para;<br>engage in extended analysis to determine that a sentence&para;<br>is not constitutionally disproportionate,” Solem, supra, at&para;<br>290, n. 16 (emphasis added), and “successful challenges” to&para;<br>noncapital sentences will be all the more “exceedingly&para;<br>rare,” Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 272 (1980).&para;<br>We have “not established a clear or consistent path for&para;<br>courts to follow” in applying the highly deferential “narrow&para;<br>proportionality” analysis. Lockyer, supra, at 72. We have,&para;<br>however, emphasized the primacy of the legislature in&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C.

Ewing, supra,&para;<br>at 23 (plurality opinion); Harmelin, supra, at 998–1001&para;<br>(opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Most importantly, however, we&para;<br>have explained that the Eighth Amendment “ ‘does not&para;<br>require strict proportionality between crime and sen&para;<br>tence’ ”; rather, “ ‘it forbids only extreme sentences that are&para;<br>“grossly disproportionate” to the crime.’ ” Ewing, supra, at&para;<br>23 (plurality opinion) (quoting Harmelin, supra, at 1001&para;<br>(opinion of KENNEDY, J.)).&para;<br>Our cases indicate that courts conducting “narrow pro&para;<br>portionality” review should begin with a threshold inquiry&para;<br>that compares “the gravity of the offense and the harsh&para;<br>ness of the penalty.” Solem, 463 U.

This insight animated our decision in&para;<br>Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815 (1988), in which we&para;<br>invalidated a capital sentence imposed on a juvenile who&para;<br>had committed his crime under the age of 16. More re&para;<br>cently, in Roper, 543 U. S. 551, we extended the prohibi&para;<br>tion on executions to those who committed their crimes&para;<br>before the age of 18.&para;<br>Both Thompson and Roper arose in the unique context&para;<br>of the death penalty, a punishment that our Court has&para;<br>recognized “must be limited to those offenders who commit&para;<br>‘a narrow category of the most serious crimes’ and whose&para;<br>extreme culpability makes them ‘the most deserving of&para;<br>execution.’ ” 543 U. S., at 568 (quoting Atkins v. Virginia,&para;<br>536 U. S. 304, 319 (2002)). Roper’s prohibition on the&para;<br>juvenile death penalty followed from our conclusion that&para;<br>“[t]hree general differences between juveniles under 18&para;<br>and adults demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot&para;<br>with reliability be classified among the worst offenders.”&para;<br>543 U. S., at 569. These differences are a lack of maturity&para;<br>and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility, a height&para;<br>ened susceptibility to negative influences and outside&para;<br>pressures, and the fact that the character of a juvenile is&para;<br>“more transitory” and “less fixed” than that of an adult.&para;<br>Id., at 569–570. Together, these factors establish the&para;<br>“diminished culpability of juveniles,” id., at 571, and “ren&para;<br>der suspect any conclusion” that juveniles are among “the&para;<br>worst offenders” for whom the death penalty is reserved,&para;<br>id., at 570.&para;<br>Today, the Court views Roper as providing the basis for&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>a new categorical rule that juveniles may never receive a&para;<br>sentence of life without parole for nonhomicide crimes. I&para;<br>disagree. In Roper, the Court tailored its analysis of&para;<br>juvenile characteristics to the specific question whether&para;<br>juvenile offenders could constitutionally be subject to&para;<br>capital punishment. Our answer that they could not be&para;<br>sentenced to death was based on the explicit conclusion&para;<br>that they “cannot with reliability be classified among the&para;<br>worst offenders.” Id., at 569 (emphasis added).&para;<br>This conclusion does not establish that juveniles can&para;<br>never be eligible for life without parole. A life sentence is&para;<br>of course far less severe than a death sentence, and we&para;<br>have never required that it be imposed only on the very&para;<br>worst offenders, as we have with capital punishment.&para;<br>Treating juvenile life sentences as analogous to capital&para;<br>punishment is at odds with our longstanding view that&para;<br>“the death penalty is different from other punishments in&para;<br>kind rather than degree.” Solem, supra, at 294. It is also&para;<br>at odds with Roper itself, which drew the line at capital&para;<br>punishment by blessing juvenile sentences that are “less&para;<br>severe than death” despite involving “forfeiture of some of&para;<br>the most basic liberties.” 543 U. S., at 573–574. Indeed,&para;<br>Roper explicitly relied on the possible imposition of life&para;<br>without parole on some juvenile offenders. Id., at 572.&para;<br>But the fact that Roper does not support a categorical&para;<br>rule barring life sentences for all juveniles does not mean&para;<br>that a criminal defendant’s age is irrelevant to those&para;<br>sentences. On the contrary, our cases establish that the&para;<br>“narrow proportionality” review applicable to noncapital&para;<br>cases itself takes the personal “culpability of the offender”&para;<br>into account in examining whether a given punishment is&para;<br>proportionate to the crime. Solem, supra, at 292. There&para;<br>is no reason why an offender’s juvenile status should be&para;<br>excluded from the analysis. Indeed, given Roper’s conclu&para;<br>sion that juveniles are typically less blameworthy than&para;<br>adults, 543 U. S., at 571, an offender’s juvenile status can&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>play a central role in the inquiry.&para;<br>JUSTICE THOMAS disagrees with even our limited reli&para;<br>ance on Roper on the ground that the present case does&para;<br>not involve capital punishment. Post, at 26 (dissenting&para;<br>opinion). That distinction is important—indeed, it under&para;<br>lies our rejection of the categorical rule declared by the&para;<br>Court. But Roper’s conclusion that juveniles are typically&para;<br>less culpable than adults has pertinence beyond capital&para;<br>cases, and rightly informs the case-specific inquiry I be&para;<br>lieve to be appropriate here.&para;<br>In short, our existing precedent already provides a&para;<br>sufficient framework for assessing the concerns outlined&para;<br>by the majority. Not every juvenile receiving a life sen&para;<br>tence will prevail under this approach. Not every juvenile&para;<br>should. But all will receive the protection that the Eighth&para;<br>Amendment requires.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Applying the “narrow proportionality” framework to the&para;<br>particular facts of this case, I conclude that Graham’s&para;<br>sentence of life without parole violates the Eighth&para;<br>Amendment.*&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* JUSTICE ALITO suggests that Graham has failed to preserve any&para;<br>challenge to his sentence based on the “narrow, as-applied proportional&para;<br>ity principle.” Post, at 1 (dissenting opinion). I disagree. It is true that&para;<br>Graham asks us to declare, categorically, that no juvenile convicted of a&para;<br>nonhomicide offense may ever be subject to a sentence of life without&para;<br>parole. But he claims that this rule is warranted under the narrow&para;<br>proportionality principle we set forth in Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277&para;<br>(1983), Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957 (1991), and Ewing v.&para;<br>California, 538 U. S. 11 (2003). Brief for Petitioner 30, 31, 54–64.&para;<br>Insofar as he relies on that framework, I believe we may do so as well,&para;<br>even if our analysis results in a narrower holding than the categorical rule Graham seeks. See also Reply Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 8&para;<br>(“[T]he Court could rule narrowly in this case and hold only that&para;<br>petitioner’s sentence of life without parole was unconstitutionally&para;<br>disproportionate”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>I begin with the threshold inquiry comparing the gravity&para;<br>of Graham’s conduct to the harshness of his penalty.&para;<br>There is no question that the crime for which Graham&para;<br>received his life sentence—armed burglary of a nondomicil&para;<br>with an assault or battery—is “a serious crime deserving&para;<br>serious punishment.” Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782,&para;<br>797 (1982). So too is the home invasion robbery that was&para;<br>the basis of Graham’s probation violation. But these&para;<br>crimes are certainly less serious than other crimes, such&para;<br>as murder or rape.&para;<br>As for Graham’s degree of personal culpability, he com&para;<br>mitted the relevant offenses when he was a juvenile—a&para;<br>stage at which, Roper emphasized, one’s “culpability or&para;<br>blameworthiness is diminished, to a substantial degree, by&para;<br>reason of youth and immaturity.” 543 U. S., at 571. Gra&para;<br>ham’s age places him in a significantly different category&para;<br>from the defendants in Rummel, Harmelin, and Ewing, all&para;<br>of whom committed their crimes as adults. Graham’s&para;<br>youth made him relatively more likely to engage in reck&para;<br>less and dangerous criminal activity than an adult; it also&para;<br>likely enhanced his susceptibility to peer pressure. See,&para;<br>e.g., Roper, supra, at 569; Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350,&para;<br>367 (1993); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115–117&para;<br>(1982). There is no reason to believe that Graham should&para;<br>be denied the general presumption of diminished culpabil&para;<br>ity that Roper indicates should apply to juvenile offenders.&para;<br>If anything, Graham’s in-court statements—including his&para;<br>request for a second chance so that he could “do whatever&para;<br>it takes to get to the NFL”—underscore his immaturity.&para;<br>App. 380.&para;<br>The fact that Graham committed the crimes that he did&para;<br>proves that he was dangerous and deserved to be pun&para;<br>ished.

FLORIDA&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>reserved. On the contrary, his lack of prior criminal con&para;<br>victions, his youth and immaturity, and the difficult cir&para;<br>cumstances of his upbringing noted by the majority, ante,&para;<br>at 1, all suggest that he was markedly less culpable than a&para;<br>typical adult who commits the same offenses.&para;<br>Despite these considerations, the trial court sentenced&para;<br>Graham to life in prison without the possibility of parole.&para;<br>This is the second-harshest sentence available under our&para;<br>precedents for any crime, and the most severe sanction&para;<br>available for a nonhomicide offense. See Kennedy v. Lou&para;<br>isiana, 554 U. S. ___ (2008). Indeed, as the majority notes,&para;<br>Graham’s sentence far exceeded the punishment proposed&para;<br>by the Florida Department of Corrections (which sug&para;<br>gested a sentence of four years, Brief for Petitioner 20),&para;<br>and the state prosecutors (who asked that he be sentenced&para;<br>to 30 years in prison for the armed burglary, App. 388).&para;<br>No one in Graham’s case other than the sentencing judge&para;<br>appears to have believed that Graham deserved to go to&para;<br>prison for life.&para;<br>Based on the foregoing circumstances, I conclude that&para;<br>there is a strong inference that Graham’s sentence of life&para;<br>imprisonment without parole was grossly disproportionate&para;<br>in violation of the Eighth Amendment. I therefore proceed&para;<br>to the next steps of the proportionality analysis.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Both intrajurisdictional and interjurisdictional compari&para;<br>sons of Graham’s sentence confirm the threshold inference&para;<br>of disproportionality.&para;<br>Graham’s sentence was far more severe than that im&para;<br>posed for similar violations of Florida law, even without&para;<br>taking juvenile status into account. For example, indi&para;<br>viduals who commit burglary or robbery offenses in Flor&para;<br>ida receive average sentences of less than 5 years and less&para;<br>than 10 years, respectively.

Unsurprisingly, Florida’s juvenile&para;<br>criminals receive similarly low sentences—typically less&para;<br>than five years for burglary and less than seven years for&para;<br>robbery. Id., at 36. Graham’s life without parole sentence&para;<br>was far more severe than the average sentence imposed on&para;<br>those convicted of murder or manslaughter, who typically&para;<br>receive under 25 years in prison. Id., at 35. As the Court&para;<br>explained in Solem, 463 U. S., at 291, “[i]f more serious&para;<br>crimes are subject to the same penalty, or to less serious&para;<br>penalties, that is some indication that the punishment at&para;<br>issue may be excessive.”&para;<br>Finally, the inference that Graham’s sentence is dispro&para;<br>portionate is further validated by comparison to the sen&para;<br>tences imposed in other domestic jurisdictions. As the&para;<br>majority opinion explains, Florida is an outlier in its will&para;<br>ingness to impose sentences of life without parole on juve&para;<br>niles convicted of nonhomicide crimes. See ante, at 11–13.&para;<br>III&para;<br>So much for Graham. But what about Milagro Cun&para;<br>ningham, a 17-year-old who beat and raped an 8-year-old&para;<br>girl before leaving her to die under 197 pounds of rock in a&para;<br>recycling bin in a remote landfill? See Musgrave, Cruel or&para;<br>Necessary? Life Terms for Youths Spur National Debate,&para;<br>Palm Beach Post, Oct. 15, 2009, p. 1A.

See 3 Sentenced&para;<br>to Life for Gang Rape of Mother, Associated Press, Oct. 14,&para;<br>2009. The fact that Graham cannot be sentenced to life&para;<br>without parole for his conduct says nothing whatever&para;<br>about these offenders, or others like them who commit&para;<br>nonhomicide crimes far more reprehensible than the&para;<br>conduct at issue here. The Court uses Graham’s case as a&para;<br>vehicle to proclaim a new constitutional rule—applicable&para;<br>well beyond the particular facts of Graham’s case—that a&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>sentence of life without parole imposed on any juvenile for&para;<br>any nonhomicide offense is unconstitutional. This cate&para;<br>gorical conclusion is as unnecessary as it is unwise.&para;<br>A holding this broad is unnecessary because the particu&para;<br>lar conduct and circumstances at issue in the case before&para;<br>us are not serious enough to justify Graham’s sentence.&para;<br>In reaching this conclusion, there is no need for the Court&para;<br>to decide whether that same sentence would be constitu&para;<br>tional if imposed for other more heinous nonhomicide&para;<br>crimes.&para;<br>A more restrained approach is especially appropriate in&para;<br>light of the Court’s apparent recognition that it is perfectly&para;<br>legitimate for a juvenile to receive a sentence of life with&para;<br>out parole for committing murder. This means that there&para;<br>is nothing inherently unconstitutional about imposing&para;<br>sentences of life without parole on juvenile offenders;&para;<br>rather, the constitutionality of such sentences depends on&para;<br>the particular crimes for which they are imposed. But if&para;<br>the constitutionality of the sentence turns on the particu&para;<br>lar crime being punished, then the Court should limit its&para;<br>holding to the particular offenses that Graham committed&para;<br>here, and should decline to consider other hypothetical&para;<br>crimes not presented by this case.&para;<br>In any event, the Court’s categorical conclusion is also&para;<br>unwise. Most importantly, it ignores the fact that some&para;<br>nonhomicide crimes—like the ones committed by Milagro&para;<br>Cunningham, Nathan Walker, and Jakaris Taylor—are&para;<br>especially heinous or grotesque, and thus may be deserv&para;<br>ing of more severe punishment.&para;<br>Those under 18 years old may as a general matter have&para;<br>“diminished” culpability relative to adults who commit the&para;<br>same crimes, Roper, 543 U. S., at 571, but that does not&para;<br>mean that their culpability is always insufficient to justify&para;<br>a life sentence. See generally Thompson, 487 U.

It argues that a case-by-case approach to proportional&para;<br>ity review is constitutionally insufficient because courts&para;<br>might not be able “with sufficient accuracy [to] distinguish&para;<br>the few incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that&para;<br>have the capacity for change.” Ante, at 27.&para;<br>The Court is of course correct that judges will never&para;<br>have perfect foresight—or perfect wisdom—in making&para;<br>sentencing decisions. But this is true when they sentence&para;<br>adults no less than when they sentence juveniles. It is&para;<br>also true when they sentence juveniles who commit mur&para;<br>der no less than when they sentence juveniles who commit&para;<br>other crimes.&para;<br>Our system depends upon sentencing judges applying&para;<br>their reasoned judgment to each case that comes before&para;<br>them. As we explained in Solem, the whole enterprise of&para;<br>proportionality review is premised on the “justified” as&para;<br>sumption that “courts are competent to judge the gravity&para;<br>of an offense, at least on a relative scale.” 463 U. S., at&para;<br>292. Indeed, “courts traditionally have made these judg&para;<br>ments” by applying “generally accepted criteria” to analyze&para;<br>“the harm caused or threatened to the victim or society,&para;<br>and the culpability of the offender.” Id., at 292, 294.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v.

See&para;<br>Harmelin, 501 U. S., at 975–985 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).&para;<br>Here, it suffices to recall just two points. First, the Clause&para;<br>does not expressly refer to proportionality or invoke any&para;<br>synonym for that term, even though the Framers were&para;<br>familiar with the concept, as evidenced by several found&para;<br>ing-era state constitutions that required (albeit without&para;<br>defining) proportional punishments. See id., at 977–978.&para;<br>In addition, the penal statute adopted by the First Con&para;<br>gress demonstrates that proportionality in sentencing was&para;<br>not considered a constitutional command.1 See id., at&para;<br>980–981 (noting that the statute prescribed capital pun&para;<br>ishment for offenses ranging from “ ‘run[ning] away with&para;<br>. . . goods or merchandise to the value of fifty dollars,’ ” to&para;<br>“murder on the high seas” (quoting 1 Stat. 114)); see also&para;<br>Preyer, Penal Measures in the American Colonies: An&para;<br>Overview, 26 Am.

I disagree. Both the Court and&para;<br>the concurrence do more than apply existing noncapital proportionality&para;<br>precedents to the particulars of Graham’s claim.

Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977) (plurality opin&para;<br>ion) (rape of an adult woman); Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554&para;<br>U. S. ___ (2008) (rape of a child); Enmund v. Florida, 458&para;<br>U.

S. 304 (2002) (mentally retarded offenders). In adopting&para;<br>these categorical proportionality rules, the Court intrudes&para;<br>upon areas that the Constitution reserves to other (state&para;<br>and federal) organs of government. The Eighth Amend&para;<br>ment prohibits the government from inflicting a cruel and&para;<br>unusual method of punishment upon a defendant. Other&para;<br>constitutional provisions ensure the defendant’s right to&para;<br>fair process before any punishment is imposed. But, as&para;<br>members of today’s majority note, “[s]ociety changes,” ante,&para;<br>at 1 (STEVENS, J., concurring), and the Eighth Amendment&para;<br>leaves the unavoidably moral question of who “deserves” a&para;<br>particular nonprohibited method of punishment to the&para;<br>judgment of the legislatures that authorize the penalty, the&para;<br>prosecutors who seek it, and the judges and juries that&para;<br>impose it under circumstances they deem appropriate.&para;<br>The Court has nonetheless adopted categorical rules&para;<br>that shield entire classes of offenses and offenders from&para;<br>the death penalty on the theory that “evolving standards&para;<br>of decency” require this result. Ante, at 7 (internal quota&para;<br>tion marks omitted). The Court has offered assurances&para;<br>that these standards can be reliably measured by “ ‘objec&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tive indicia’ ” of “national consensus,” such as state and&para;<br>federal legislation, jury behavior, and (surprisingly, given&para;<br>that we are talking about “national” consensus) interna&para;<br>tional opinion. Ante, at 10 (quoting Roper, supra, at 563);&para;<br>see also ante, at 10–16, 29–31. Yet even assuming that is&para;<br>true, the Framers did not provide for the constitutionality&para;<br>of a particular type of punishment to turn on a “snapshot&para;<br>of American public opinion” taken at the moment a case&para;<br>is decided. Roper, supra, at 629 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).&para;<br>By holding otherwise, the Court pretermits in all but one&para;<br>direction the evolution of the standards it describes, thus&para;<br>“calling a constitutional halt to what may well be a pen&para;<br>dulum swing in social attitudes,” Thompson, supra, at&para;<br>869 (SCALIA, J., dissenting), and “stunt[ing] legislative&para;<br>consideration” of new questions of penal policy as they&para;<br>emerge, Kennedy, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2) (ALITO, J.,&para;<br>dissenting).&para;<br>But the Court is not content to rely on snapshots of&para;<br>community consensus in any event. Ante, at 16 (“Commu&para;<br>nity consensus, while ‘entitled to great weight,’ is not itself&para;<br>determinative” (quoting Kennedy, supra, at __ (slip op., at&para;<br>24))). Instead, it reserves the right to reject the evidence&para;<br>of consensus it finds whenever its own “independent judg&para;<br>ment” points in a different direction. Ante, at 16. The&para;<br>Court thus openly claims the power not only to approve or&para;<br>disapprove of democratic choices in penal policy based on&para;<br>evidence of how society’s standards have evolved, but also&para;<br>on the basis of the Court’s “independent” perception of&para;<br>how those standards should evolve, which depends on&para;<br>what the Court concedes is “ ‘ “necessarily . . . a moral&para;<br>judgment” ’ ” regarding the propriety of a given punish&para;<br>ment in today’s society. Ante, at 7 (quoting Kennedy,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 8)).&para;<br>The categorical proportionality review the Court em&para;<br>ploys in capital cases thus lacks a principled foundation.&para;<br>The Court’s decision today is significant because it does&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>not merely apply this standard—it remarkably expands its&para;<br>reach. For the first time in its history, the Court declares&para;<br>an entire class of offenders immune from a noncapital&para;<br>sentence using the categorical approach it previously&para;<br>reserved for death penalty cases alone.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Until today, the Court has based its categorical propor&para;<br>tionality rulings on the notion that the Constitution gives&para;<br>special protection to capital defendants because the death&para;<br>penalty is a uniquely severe punishment that must be&para;<br>reserved for only those who are “most deserving of execu&para;<br>tion.” Atkins, supra, at 319; see Roper, supra, at 568;&para;<br>Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982); Lockett v.&para;<br>Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978).&para;<br>Of course, the Eighth&para;<br>Amendment itself makes no distinction between capital&para;<br>and noncapital sentencing, but the “ ‘bright line’ ” the&para;<br>Court drew between the two penalties has for many years&para;<br>served as the principal justification for the Court’s will&para;<br>ingness to reject democratic choices regarding the death&para;<br>penalty. See Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 275 (1980).&para;<br>Today’s decision eviscerates that distinction. “Death is&para;<br>different” no longer. The Court now claims not only the&para;<br>power categorically to reserve the “most severe punish&para;<br>ment” for those the Court thinks are “ ‘the most deserving&para;<br>of execution,’ ” Roper, 543 U. S., at 568 (quoting Atkins,&para;<br>536 U. S., at 319), but also to declare that “less culpable”&para;<br>persons are categorically exempt from the “second most&para;<br>severe penalty.” Ante, at 21 (emphasis added). No reli&para;<br>able limiting principle remains to prevent the Court from&para;<br>immunizing any class of offenders from the law’s third,&para;<br>fourth, fifth, or fiftieth most severe penalties as well.&para;<br>The Court’s departure from the “death is different”&para;<br>distinction is especially mystifying when one considers&para;<br>how long it has resisted crossing that divide. Indeed, for a&para;<br>time the Court declined to apply proportionality principles&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>to noncapital sentences at all, emphasizing that “a sen&para;<br>tence of death differs in kind from any sentence of impris&para;<br>onment, no matter how long.” Rummel, 445 U. S., at 272&para;<br>(emphasis added). Based on that rationale, the Court&para;<br>found that the excessiveness of one prison term as com&para;<br>pared to another was “properly within the province of&para;<br>legislatures, not courts,” id., at 275–276, precisely because&para;<br>it involved an “invariably . . . subjective determination,&para;<br>there being no clear way to make ‘any constitutional dis&para;<br>tinction between one term of years and a shorter or longer&para;<br>term of years,’ ” Hutto v. Davis, 454 U. S. 370, 373 (1982)&para;<br>(per curiam) (quoting Rummel, supra, at 275; emphasis&para;<br>added).&para;<br>Even when the Court broke from that understanding in&para;<br>its 5-to-4 decision in Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277 (1983)&para;<br>(striking down as “grossly disproportionate” a life-without&para;<br>parole sentence imposed on a defendant for passing a&para;<br>worthless check), the Court did so only as applied to the&para;<br>facts of that case; it announced no categorical rule. Id., at&para;<br>288, 303. Moreover, the Court soon cabined Solem’s ra&para;<br>tionale. The controlling opinion in the Court’s very next&para;<br>noncapital proportionality case emphasized that principles&para;<br>of federalism require substantial deference to legislative&para;<br>choices regarding the proper length of prison sentences.&para;<br>Harmelin, 501 U. S., at 999 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.)&para;<br>(“[M]arked divergences both in underlying theories of&para;<br>sentencing and in the length of prescribed prison terms&para;<br>are the inevitable, often beneficial, result of the federal&para;<br>structure”); id., at 1000 (“[D]iffering attitudes and percep&para;<br>tions of local conditions may yield different, yet rational,&para;<br>conclusions regarding the appropriate length of prison&para;<br>terms for particular crimes”). That opinion thus concluded&para;<br>that “successful challenges to the proportionality of&para;<br>[prison] sentences [would be] exceedingly rare.” Id., at&para;<br>1001 (internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>They have been rare indeed. In the 28 years since&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Solem, the Court has considered just three such chal&para;<br>lenges and has rejected them all, see Ewing v. California,&para;<br>538 U. S. 11 (2003); Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63&para;<br>(2003); Harmelin, supra, largely on the theory that criti&para;<br>cisms of the “wisdom, cost-efficiency, and effectiveness” of&para;<br>term-of-years prison sentences are “appropriately directed&para;<br>at the legislature[s],” not the courts, Ewing, supra, at 27,&para;<br>28 (plurality opinion). The Court correctly notes that&para;<br>those decisions were “closely divided,” ante, at 8, but so&para;<br>was Solem itself, and it is now fair to describe Solem as an&para;<br>outlier.2&para;<br>Remarkably, the Court today does more than return to&para;<br>Solem’s case-by-case proportionality standard for noncapi&para;<br>tal sentences; it hurtles past it to impose a categorical&para;<br>proportionality rule banning life-without-parole sentences&para;<br>not just in this case, but in every case involving a juvenile&para;<br>nonhomicide offender, no matter what the circumstances.&para;<br>Neither the Eighth Amendment nor the Court’s prece&para;<br>dents justify this decision.&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Court asserts that categorical proportionality re&para;<br>view is necessary here merely because Graham asks for a&para;<br>categorical rule, see ante, at 10, and because the Court&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Courts&para;<br>&para;<br>and commentators interpreting this Court’s decisions have&para;<br>reached this conclusion. See, e.g., United States v. Polk, 546 F. 3d 74,&para;<br>76 (CA1 2008) (“[I]nstances of gross disproportionality [in noncapital&para;<br>cases] will be hen’s-teeth rare”); Barkow, The Court of Life and Death:&para;<br>The Two Tracks of Constitutional Sentencing Law and the Case for&para;<br>Uniformity, 107 Mich.

FLORIDA&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>thinks clear lines are a good idea, see ante, at 25. I find&para;<br>those factors wholly insufficient to justify the Court’s&para;<br>break from past practice. First, the Court fails to ac&para;<br>knowledge that a petitioner seeking to exempt an entire&para;<br>category of offenders from a sentencing practice carries a&para;<br>much heavier burden than one seeking case-specific relief&para;<br>under Solem. Unlike the petitioner in Solem, Graham&para;<br>must establish not only that his own life-without-parole&para;<br>sentence is “grossly disproportionate,” but also that such a&para;<br>sentence is always grossly disproportionate whenever it is&para;<br>applied to a juvenile nonhomicide offender, no matter how&para;<br>heinous his crime. Cf. United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S.&para;<br>739 (1987). Second, even applying the Court’s categorical&para;<br>“evolving standards” test, neither objective evidence of&para;<br>national consensus nor the notions of culpability on which&para;<br>the Court’s “independent judgment” relies can justify the&para;<br>categorical rule it declares here.&para;<br>A&para;<br>According to the Court, proper Eighth Amendment&para;<br>analysis “begins with objective indicia of national consen&para;<br>sus,”3 and “[t]he clearest and most reliable objective evi&para;<br>dence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by&para;<br>the country’s legislatures,” ante, at 10–11 (internal quota&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The Court ignores entirely the threshold inquiry of whether subject&para;<br>ing juvenile offenders to adult penalties was one of the “modes or acts of&para;<br>punishment that had been considered cruel and unusual at the time&para;<br>that the Bill of Rights was adopted.” Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S.&para;<br>399, 405 (1986). As the Court has noted in the past, however, the&para;<br>evidence is clear that, at the time of the Founding, “the common law set&para;<br>a rebuttable presumption of incapacity to commit any felony at the age&para;<br>of 14, and theoretically permitted [even] capital punishment to be&para;<br>imposed on a person as young as age 7.” Stanford v. Kentucky, 492&para;<br>U. S. 361, 368 (1989) (citing 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *23–*24; 1&para;<br>M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 24–29 (1800)). It thus seems exceedingly&para;<br>unlikely that the imposition of a life-without-parole sentence on a&para;<br>person of Graham’s age would run afoul of those standards.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tion marks omitted). As such, the analysis should end&para;<br>quickly, because a national “consensus” in favor of the&para;<br>Court’s result simply does not exist. The laws of all 50&para;<br>States, the Federal Government, and the District of Co&para;<br>lumbia provide that juveniles over a certain age may be&para;<br>tried in adult court if charged with certain crimes.4 See&para;<br>ante, at 33–35 (Appendix to opinion of the Court). Forty&para;<br>five States, the Federal Government, and the District of&para;<br>Columbia expose juvenile offenders charged in adult court&para;<br>to the very same range of punishments faced by adults&para;<br>charged with the same crimes. See ante, at 33–34, Part I.&para;<br>Eight of those States do not make life-without-parole&para;<br>sentences available for any nonhomicide offender, regard&para;<br>less of age.5 All remaining jurisdictions—the Federal&para;<br>Government, the other 37 States, and the District—&para;<br>authorize life-without-parole sentences for certain non&para;<br>homicide offenses, and authorize the imposition of such&para;<br>sentences on persons under 18. See ibid. Only five States&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Although&para;<br>&para;<br>the details of state laws vary extensively, they generally&para;<br>permit the transfer of a juvenile offender to adult court through one or&para;<br>more of the following mechanisms: (1) judicial waiver, in which the&para;<br>juvenile court has the authority to waive jurisdiction over the offender&para;<br>and transfer the case to adult court; (2) concurrent jurisdiction, in&para;<br>which adult and juvenile courts share jurisdiction over certain cases&para;<br>and the prosecutor has discretion to file in either court; or (3) statutory&para;<br>provisions that exclude juveniles who commit certain crimes from&para;<br>juvenile-court jurisdiction.

(“[T]he relative&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 I say “recent memory” because the research relied upon by the Court&para;<br>provides a headcount of juvenile nonhomicide offenders presently&para;<br>incarcerated in this country, but does not provide more specific infor&para;<br>mation about all of the offenders, such as the dates on which they were&para;<br>convicted.&para;<br>10 When issued, the Court’s opinion relied on a letter the Court had&para;<br>requested from the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), which stated that there&para;<br>were six juvenile nonhomicide offenders then serving life-without&para;<br>parole sentences in the federal system. After the Court released its&para;<br>opinion, the Acting Solicitor General disputed the BOP’s calculations&para;<br>and stated that none of those six offenders was serving a life without&para;<br>parole sentence solely for a juvenile nonhomicide crime completed&para;<br>before the age of 18. See Letter from Neal Kumar Katyal, Acting&para;<br>Solicitor General, U. S.

The Court has amended its opinion in&para;<br>light of the Acting Solicitor General’s letter. In my view, the inconsis&para;<br>tency between the BOP’s classification of these six offenders and the&para;<br>Solicitor General’s is irrelevant. The fact remains that federal law, and&para;<br>the laws of a supermajority of States, permit this sentencing practice.&para;<br>And, as will be explained, see infra this page and 16–20, judges and&para;<br>jurors have chosen to impose this sentence in the very worst cases they&para;<br>have encountered.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>infrequency of jury verdicts imposing the death sentence&para;<br>does not indicate rejection of capital punishment per se.&para;<br>Rather, [it] . . . may well reflect the humane feeling that&para;<br>this most irrevocable of sanctions should be reserved for a&para;<br>small number of extreme cases”). It should also be re&para;<br>jected here. That a punishment is rarely imposed demon&para;<br>strates nothing more than a general consensus that it&para;<br>should be just that—rarely imposed. It is not proof that&para;<br>the punishment is one the Nation abhors.&para;<br>The Court nonetheless insists that the 26 States that&para;<br>authorize this penalty, but are not presently incarcerating&para;<br>a juvenile nonhomicide offender on a life-without-parole&para;<br>sentence, cannot be counted as approving its use. The&para;<br>mere fact that the laws of a jurisdiction permit this pen&para;<br>alty, the Court explains, “does not indicate that the pen&para;<br>alty has been endorsed through deliberate, express, and&para;<br>full legislative consideration.” Ante, at 16.&para;<br>But this misapplies the Court’s own evolving standards&para;<br>test. Under that test, “[i]t is not the burden of [a State] to&para;<br>establish a national consensus approving what their citi&para;<br>zens have voted to do; rather, it is the ‘heavy burden’ of&para;<br>petitioners to establish a national consensus against it.”&para;<br>Stanford v.

In light of this fact,&para;<br>the Court is wrong to equate a jurisdiction’s disuse of a&para;<br>legislatively authorized penalty with its moral opposition&para;<br>to it. The fact that the laws of a jurisdiction permit this&para;<br>sentencing practice demonstrates, at a minimum, that the&para;<br>citizens of that jurisdiction find tolerable the possibility&para;<br>that a jury of their peers could impose a life-without&para;<br>parole sentence on a juvenile whose nonhomicide crime is&para;<br>sufficiently depraved.&para;<br>The recent case of 16-year-old Keighton Budder illus&para;<br>trates this point.

Rice, Juvenile Life Without Parole for&para;<br>Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida Compared to Nation 2, 14&para;<br>(Sept. 14, 2009) (Table A). Without his conviction, there&para;<br>fore, the Court would have counted Oklahoma’s citizens as&para;<br>morally opposed to life-without-parole sentences for juve&para;<br>niles nonhomicide offenders.&para;<br>Yet Oklahoma’s experience proves the inescapable flaw&para;<br>in that reasoning: Oklahoma citizens have enacted laws&para;<br>that allow Oklahoma juries to consider life-without-parole&para;<br>sentences in juvenile nonhomicide cases. Oklahoma juries&para;<br>invoke those laws rarely—in the unusual cases that they&para;<br>find exceptionally depraved. I cannot agree with the&para;<br>Court that Oklahoma citizens should be constitutionally&para;<br>disabled from using this sentencing practice merely be&para;<br>cause they have not done so more frequently. If anything,&para;<br>the rarity of this penalty’s use underscores just how judi&para;<br>cious sentencing judges and juries across the country have&para;<br>been in invoking it.&para;<br>This fact is entirely consistent with the Court’s intuition&para;<br>that juveniles generally are less culpable and more capable&para;<br>of growth than adults. See infra, at 21–22. Graham’s own&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>case provides another example. Graham was statutorily&para;<br>eligible for a life-without-parole sentence after his first&para;<br>crime. But the record indicates that the trial court did not&para;<br>give such a sentence serious consideration at Graham’s&para;<br>initial plea hearing. It was only after Graham subse&para;<br>quently violated his parole by invading a home at gun&para;<br>point that the maximum sentence was imposed.&para;<br>In sum, the Court’s calculation that 123 juvenile non&para;<br>homicide life-without-parole sentences have been imposed&para;<br>nationwide in recent memory, even if accepted, hardly&para;<br>amounts to strong evidence that the sentencing practice&para;<br>offends our common sense of decency.11&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 Because&para;<br>&para;<br>existing legislation plainly suffices to refute any consensus&para;<br>against this sentencing practice, I assume the accuracy of the Court’s&para;<br>evidence regarding the frequency with which this sentence has been&para;<br>imposed. But I would be remiss if I did not mention two points about&para;<br>the Court’s figures. First, it seems odd that the Court counts only those&para;<br>juveniles sentenced to life without parole and excludes from its analysis&para;<br>all juveniles sentenced to lengthy term-of-years sentences (e.g., 70 or 80&para;<br>years’ imprisonment). It is difficult to argue that a judge or jury&para;<br>imposing such a long sentence—which effectively denies the offender&para;<br>any material opportunity for parole—would express moral outrage at a&para;<br>life-without-parole sentence.&para;<br>Second, if objective indicia of consensus were truly important to the&para;<br>Court’s analysis, the statistical information presently available would&para;<br>be woefully inadequate to form the basis of an Eighth Amendment rule&para;<br>that can be revoked only by constitutional amendment. The only&para;<br>evidence submitted to this Court regarding the frequency of this sen&para;<br>tence’s imposition was a single study completed after this Court&para;<br>granted certiorari in this case. See P. Annino, D. Rasmussen, &amp; C.&para;<br>Rice, Juvenile Life Without Parole for Non-Homicide Offenses: Florida&para;<br>Compared to Nation 2 (Sept. 14, 2009). Although I have no reason to&para;<br>question the professionalism with which this study was conducted, the&para;<br>study itself acknowledges that it was incomplete and the first of its&para;<br>kind. See id., at 1. The Court’s questionable decision to “complete” the&para;<br>study on its own does not materially increase its reliability. For one&para;<br>thing, by finishing the study itself, the Court prohibits the parties from&para;<br>ever disputing its findings. Complicating matters further, the original&para;<br>study sometimes relied on third-party data rather than data from the&para;<br>States themselves, see ibid.; the study has never been peer reviewed;&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>19&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Finally, I cannot help but note that the statistics the&para;<br>Court finds inadequate to justify the penalty in this case&para;<br>are stronger than those supporting at least one other&para;<br>penalty this Court has upheld. Not long ago, this Court,&para;<br>joined by the author of today’s opinion, upheld the applica&para;<br>tion of the death penalty against a 16-year-old, despite the&para;<br>fact that no such punishment had been carried out on a&para;<br>person of that age in this country in nearly 30 years. See&para;<br>Stanford, 492 U. S., at 374. Whatever the statistical&para;<br>frequency with which life-without-parole sentences have&para;<br>been imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders in the&para;<br>last 30 years, it is surely greater than zero.&para;<br>In the end, however, objective factors such as legislation&para;<br>and the frequency of a penalty’s use are merely ornaments&para;<br>in the Court’s analysis, window dressing that accompanies&para;<br>its judicial fiat.12 By the Court’s own decree, “[c]ommunity&para;<br>——————&para;<br>and specific data on all 123 offenders (age, date of conviction, crime of&para;<br>conviction, etc.), have not been collected, making verification of the&para;<br>Court’s headcount impossible. The Court inexplicably blames Florida&para;<br>for all of this. See ante, at 12. But as already noted, it is not Florida’s&para;<br>burden to collect data to prove a national consensus in favor of this&para;<br>sentencing practice, but Graham’s “heavy burden” to prove a consensus&para;<br>against it. See supra, at 16.&para;<br>12 I confine to a footnote the Court’s discussion of foreign laws and&para;<br>sentencing practices because past opinions explain at length why such&para;<br>factors are irrelevant to the meaning of our Constitution or the Court’s&para;<br>discernment of any longstanding tradition in this Nation. See Atkins,&para;<br>536 U. S., at 324–325 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). Here, two points&para;<br>suffice. First, despite the Court’s attempt to count the actual number of&para;<br>juvenile nonhomicide offenders serving life-without-parole sentences in&para;<br>other nations (a task even more challenging than counting them within&para;<br>our borders), the laws of other countries permit juvenile life-without&para;<br>parole sentences, see Child Rights Information, Network, C. de la Vega,&para;<br>M. Montesano, &amp; A. Solter, Human Rights Advocates, Statement on&para;<br>Juvenile Sentencing to Human Rights Council, 10th Sess. (Nov. 3,&para;<br>2009) (“Eleven countries have laws with the potential to permit the&para;<br>sentencing of child offenders to life without the possibility of release,”&para;<br>online at http://www.crin.org/resources/infoDetail.asp?ID=19806) (as&para;<br>visited May 14, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file)).&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>consensus . . . is not itself determinative.” Ante, at 16.&para;<br>Only the independent moral judgment of this Court is&para;<br>sufficient to decide the question. See ibid.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Lacking any plausible claim to consensus, the Court&para;<br>shifts to the heart of its argument: its “independent judg&para;<br>ment” that this sentencing practice does not “serv[e] legiti&para;<br>mate penological goals.” Ante, at 16–17. The Court begins&para;<br>that analysis with the obligatory preamble that “ ‘[t]he&para;<br>Eighth Amendment does not mandate adoption of any one&para;<br>penological theory,’ ” ante, at 20 (quoting Harmelin, 501&para;<br>U. S., at 999 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.)), then promptly&para;<br>mandates the adoption of the theories the Court deems&para;<br>best.&para;<br>First, the Court acknowledges that, at a minimum, the&para;<br>imposition of life-without-parole sentences on juvenile&para;<br>nonhomicide offenders serves two “legitimate” penological&para;<br>goals: incapacitation and deterrence. Ante, at 21–23. By&para;<br>definition, such sentences serve the goal of incapacitation&para;<br>by ensuring that juvenile offenders who commit armed&para;<br>burglaries, or those who commit the types of grievous sex&para;<br>crimes described by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, no longer&para;<br>threaten their communities. See ante, at 9 (opinion con&para;<br>curring in judgment). That should settle the matter, since&para;<br>the Court acknowledges that incapacitation is an “impor&para;<br>tant” penological goal. Ante, at 22. Yet, the Court finds&para;<br>this goal “inadequate” to justify the life-without-parole&para;<br>sentences here. Ante, at 22 (emphasis added). A similar&para;<br>fate befalls deterrence. The Court acknowledges that such&para;<br>sentences will deter future juvenile offenders, at least to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>Second, present legislation notwithstanding, democracies around the&para;<br>world remain free to adopt life-without-parole sentences for juvenile&para;<br>offenders tomorrow if they see fit. Starting today, ours can count itself&para;<br>among the few in which judicial decree prevents voters from making&para;<br>that choice.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>some degree, but rejects that penological goal, not as&para;<br>illegitimate, but as insufficient. Ante, at 21 (“[A]ny limited&para;<br>deterrent effect provided by life without parole is not&para;<br>enough to justify the sentence.” (emphasis added)).&para;<br>The Court looks more favorably on rehabilitation, but&para;<br>laments that life-without-parole sentences do little to&para;<br>promote this goal because they result in the offender’s&para;<br>permanent incarceration. Ante, at 23. Of course, the&para;<br>Court recognizes that rehabilitation’s “utility and proper&para;<br>implementation” are subject to debate. Ante, at 23. But&para;<br>that does not stop it from declaring that a legislature may&para;<br>not “forswea[r] . . . the rehabilitative ideal.” Ibid. In other&para;<br>words, the Eighth Amendment does not mandate “any one&para;<br>penological theory,” ante, at 20 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted), just one the Court approves.&para;<br>Ultimately, however, the Court’s “independent judg&para;<br>ment” and the proportionality rule itself center on retribu&para;<br>tion—the notion that a criminal sentence should be pro&para;<br>portioned to “ ‘the personal culpability of the criminal&para;<br>offender.’ ” Ante, at 16, 20–21 (quoting Tison v. Arizona,&para;<br>481 U. S. 137, 149 (1987)). The Court finds that retribu&para;<br>tive purposes are not served here for two reasons.&para;<br>1&para;<br>First, quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 569–570, the Court&para;<br>concludes that juveniles are less culpable than adults&para;<br>because, as compared to adults, they “have a ‘ “lack of&para;<br>maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,” ’ ”&para;<br>and “their characters are ‘not as well formed.’ ” Ante, at&para;<br>17. As a general matter, this statement is entirely consis&para;<br>tent with the evidence recounted above that judges and&para;<br>juries impose the sentence at issue quite infrequently,&para;<br>despite legislative authorization to do so in many more&para;<br>cases. See Part III–B, supra. Our society tends to treat&para;<br>the average juvenile as less culpable than the average&para;<br>adult. But the question here does not involve the average&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>juvenile. The question, instead, is whether the Constitu&para;<br>tion prohibits judges and juries from ever concluding that&para;<br>an offender under the age of 18 has demonstrated suffi&para;<br>cient depravity and incorrigibility to warrant his perma&para;<br>nent incarceration.&para;<br>In holding that the Constitution imposes such a ban, the&para;<br>Court cites “developments in psychology and brain sci&para;<br>ence” indicating that juvenile minds “continue to mature&para;<br>through late adolescence,” ante, at 17 (citing Brief for&para;<br>American Medical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 16–&para;<br>24; Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as&para;<br>Amici Curiae 22–27 (hereinafter APA Brief)), and that&para;<br>juveniles are “more likely [than adults] to engage in risky&para;<br>behaviors,” id., at 7. But even if such generalizations from&para;<br>social science were relevant to constitutional rulemaking,&para;<br>the Court misstates the data on which it relies.&para;<br>The Court equates the propensity of a fairly substantial&para;<br>number of youths to engage in “risky” or antisocial behav&para;<br>iors with the propensity of a much smaller group to com&para;<br>mit violent crimes. Ante, at 25–29. But research relied&para;<br>upon by the amici cited in the Court’s opinion differenti&para;<br>ates between adolescents for whom antisocial behavior is a&para;<br>fleeting symptom and those for whom it is a lifelong pat&para;<br>tern. See Moffitt, Adolescence-Limited and Life-CoursePersistent Antisocial Behavior: A Developmental Taxon&para;<br>omy, 100 Psychological Rev. 674, 678 (1993) (cited in APA&para;<br>Brief 8, 17, 20) (distinguishing between adolescents who&para;<br>are “antisocial only during adolescence” and a smaller&para;<br>group who engage in antisocial behavior “at every life&para;<br>stage” despite “drift[ing] through successive systems&para;<br>aimed at curbing their deviance”). That research further&para;<br>suggests that the pattern of behavior in the latter group&para;<br>often sets in before 18. See Moffitt, supra, at 684 (“The&para;<br>well-documented resistance of antisocial personality dis&para;<br>order to treatments of all kinds seems to suggest that the&para;<br>life-course-persistent style is fixed sometime before age&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>18”). And, notably, it suggests that violence itself is evi&para;<br>dence that an adolescent offender’s antisocial behavior is&para;<br>not transient. See Moffitt, A Review of Research on the&para;<br>Taxonomy of Life-Course Persistent Versus AdolescenceLimited Antisocial Behavior, in Taking Stock: the Status&para;<br>of Criminological Theory 277, 292–293 (F. Cullen, J.&para;<br>Wright, &amp; K. Blevins eds. 2006) (observing that “life&para;<br>course persistent” males “tended to specialize in serious&para;<br>offenses (carrying a hidden weapon, assault, robbery,&para;<br>violating court orders), whereas adolescence-limited” ones&para;<br>“specialized in non-serious offenses (theft less than $5,&para;<br>public drunkenness, giving false information on applica&para;<br>tion forms, pirating computer software, etc.)”).&para;<br>In sum, even if it were relevant, none of this psychologi&para;<br>cal or sociological data is sufficient to support the Court’s&para;<br>“ ‘moral’ ” conclusion that youth defeats culpability in every&para;<br>case. Ante, at 18 (quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 570); see&para;<br>id., at 618 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); R. Epstein, The Case&para;<br>Against Adolescence 171 (2007) (reporting on a study of&para;<br>juvenile reasoning skills and concluding that “most teens&para;<br>are capable of conventional, adult-like moral reasoning”).&para;<br>The Court responds that a categorical rule is nonethe&para;<br>less necessary to prevent the “ ‘unacceptable likelihood’ ”&para;<br>that a judge or jury, unduly swayed by “ ‘the brutality or&para;<br>cold-blooded nature’ ” of a juvenile’s nonhomicide crime,&para;<br>will sentence him to a life-without-parole sentence for&para;<br>which he possesses “ ‘insufficient culpability,’ ” ante, at 27&para;<br>(quoting Roper, supra, at 572–573). I find that justifica&para;<br>tion entirely insufficient. The integrity of our criminal&para;<br>justice system depends on the ability of citizens to stand&para;<br>between the defendant and an outraged public and dispas&para;<br>sionately determine his guilt and the proper amount of&para;<br>punishment based on the evidence presented. That proc&para;<br>ess necessarily admits of human error. But so does the&para;<br>process of judging in which we engage. As between the&para;<br>two, I find far more “unacceptable” that this Court,&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>swayed by studies reflecting the general tendencies of&para;<br>youth, decree that the people of this country are not fit to&para;<br>decide for themselves when the rare case requires differ&para;<br>ent treatment.&para;<br>2&para;<br>That is especially so because, in the end, the Court does&para;<br>not even believe its pronouncements about the juvenile&para;<br>mind. If it did, the categorical rule it announces today&para;<br>would be most peculiar because it leaves intact state and&para;<br>federal laws that permit life-without-parole sentences for&para;<br>juveniles who commit homicides. See ante, at 18–19. The&para;<br>Court thus acknowledges that there is nothing inherent in&para;<br>the psyche of a person less than 18 that prevents him from&para;<br>acquiring the moral agency necessary to warrant a life&para;<br>without-parole sentence. Instead, the Court rejects over&para;<br>whelming legislative consensus only on the question of&para;<br>which acts are sufficient to demonstrate that moral agency.&para;<br>The Court is quite willing to accept that a 17-year-old&para;<br>who pulls the trigger on a firearm can demonstrate suffi&para;<br>cient depravity and irredeemability to be denied reentry&para;<br>into society, but insists that a 17-year-old who rapes an 8&para;<br>year-old and leaves her for dead does not. See ante, at 17–&para;<br>19; cf. ante, at 9 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment)&para;<br>(describing the crime of life-without-parole offender Mi&para;<br>lagro Cunningham). Thus, the Court’s conclusion that&para;<br>life-without-parole sentences are “grossly disproportion&para;<br>ate” for juvenile nonhomicide offenders in fact has very&para;<br>little to do with its view of juveniles, and much more to do&para;<br>with its perception that “defendants who do not kill, in&para;<br>tend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are categori&para;<br>cally less deserving of the most serious forms of punish&para;<br>ment than are murderers.” Ante, at 18.&para;<br>That the Court is willing to impose such an exacting&para;<br>constraint on democratic sentencing choices based on such&para;<br>an untestable philosophical conclusion is remarkable. The&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>25&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>question of what acts are “deserving” of what punishments&para;<br>is bound so tightly with questions of morality and social&para;<br>conditions as to make it, almost by definition, a question&para;<br>for legislative resolution. It is true that the Court previ&para;<br>ously has relied on the notion of proportionality in holding&para;<br>certain classes of offenses categorically exempt from capi&para;<br>tal punishment. See supra, at 4. But never before today&para;<br>has the Court relied on its own view of just deserts to&para;<br>impose a categorical limit on the imposition of a lesser&para;<br>punishment. Its willingness to cross that well-established&para;<br>boundary raises the question whether any democratic&para;<br>choice regarding appropriate punishment is safe from the&para;<br>Court’s ever-expanding constitutional veto.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Although the concurrence avoids the problems associ&para;<br>ated with expanding categorical proportionality review to&para;<br>noncapital cases, it employs noncapital proportionality&para;<br>analysis in a way that raises the same fundamental&para;<br>concern. Although I do not believe Solem merits stare&para;<br>decisis treatment, Graham’s claim cannot prevail even&para;<br>under that test (as it has been limited by the Court’s&para;<br>subsequent precedents). Solem instructs a court first to&para;<br>compare the “gravity” of an offender’s conduct to the&para;<br>“harshness of the penalty” to determine whether an&para;<br>“inference” of gross disproportionality exists. 463 U. S.,&para;<br>at 290–291. Only in “the rare case” in which such an&para;<br>inference is present should the court proceed to the “ob&para;<br>jective” part of the inquiry—an intra- and interjurisdic&para;<br>tional comparison of the defendant’s sentence with others&para;<br>similarly situated. Harmelin, 501 U. S., at 1000, 1005&para;<br>(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).&para;<br>Under the Court’s precedents, I fail to see how an “in&para;<br>ference” of gross disproportionality arises here. The con&para;<br>currence notes several arguably mitigating facts—&para;<br>Graham’s “lack of prior criminal convictions, his youth and&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>immaturity, and the difficult circumstances of his upbring&para;<br>ing.” Ante, at 7 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment).&para;<br>But the Court previously has upheld a life-without-parole&para;<br>sentence imposed on a first-time offender who committed a&para;<br>nonviolent drug crime. See Harmelin, supra, at 1002–&para;<br>1004. Graham’s conviction for an actual violent felony is&para;<br>surely more severe than that offense. As for Graham’s&para;<br>age, it is true that Roper held juveniles categorically ineli&para;<br>gible for capital punishment, but as the concurrence ex&para;<br>plains, Roper was based on the “explicit conclusion that&para;<br>[juveniles] ‘cannot with reliability be classified among the&para;<br>worst offenders’ ”; it did “not establish that juveniles can&para;<br>never be eligible for life without parole.” Ante, at 5&para;<br>(ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment) (quoting Roper,&para;<br>543 U. S., at 569 (emphasis added in opinion of ROBERTS,&para;<br>C. J.)). In my view, Roper’s principles are thus not gener&para;<br>ally applicable outside the capital sentencing context.&para;<br>By holding otherwise, the concurrence relies on the&para;<br>same type of subjective judgment as the Court, only it&para;<br>restrains itself to a case-by-case rather than a categorical&para;<br>ruling. The concurrence is quite ready to hand Graham&para;<br>“the general presumption of diminished culpability” for&para;<br>juveniles, ante, at 7, apparently because it believes that&para;<br>Graham’s armed burglary and home invasion crimes were&para;<br>“certainly less serious” than murder or rape, ibid. It&para;<br>recoils only from the prospect that the Court would extend&para;<br>the same presumption to a juvenile who commits a sex&para;<br>crime. See ante, at 10. I simply cannot accept that these&para;<br>subjective judgments of proportionality are ones the&para;<br>Eighth Amendment authorizes us to make.&para;<br>The “objective” elements of the Solem test provide no&para;<br>additional support for the concurrence’s conclusion. The&para;<br>concurrence compares Graham’s sentence to “similar”&para;<br>sentences in Florida and concludes that Graham’s sen&para;<br>tence was “far more severe.” Ante, at 8 (ROBERTS, C. J,&para;<br>concurring in judgment). But strangely, the concurrence&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>27&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>uses average sentences for burglary or robbery offenses as&para;<br>examples of “similar” offenses, even though it seems that a&para;<br>run-of-the-mill burglary or robbery is not at all similar to&para;<br>Graham’s criminal history, which includes a charge for&para;<br>armed burglary with assault, and a probation violation for&para;<br>invading a home at gunpoint.&para;<br>And even if Graham’s sentence is higher than ones he&para;<br>might have received for an armed burglary with assault in&para;<br>other jurisdictions, see ante, at 8–9, this hardly seems&para;<br>relevant if one takes seriously the principle that “ ‘[a]bsent&para;<br>a constitutionally imposed uniformity inimical to tradi&para;<br>tional notions of federalism, some State will always bear&para;<br>the distinction of treating particular offenders more se&para;<br>verely than any other State.’ ” Harmelin, supra, at 1000&para;<br>(opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (quoting Rummel, 445 U. S., at&para;<br>282; emphasis added). Applying Solem, the Court has&para;<br>upheld a 25-years-to-life sentence for theft under Califor&para;<br>nia’s recidivist statute, despite the fact that the State and&para;<br>its amici could cite only “a single instance of a similar&para;<br>sentence imposed outside the context of California’s three&para;<br>strikes law, out of a prison population [then] approaching&para;<br>two million individuals.” Ewing, 538 U. S., at 47 (BREYER,&para;<br>J., dissenting). It has also upheld a life-without-parole&para;<br>sentence for a first-time drug offender in Michigan&para;<br>charged with possessing 672 grams of cocaine despite the&para;<br>fact that only one other State would have authorized such&para;<br>a stiff penalty for a first-time drug offense, and even that&para;<br>State required a far greater quantity of cocaine (10 kilo&para;<br>grams) to trigger the penalty. See Harmelin, supra, at&para;<br>1026 (White, J., dissenting). Graham’s sentence is cer&para;<br>tainly less rare than the sentences upheld in these cases,&para;<br>so his claim fails even under Solem&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Both the Court and the concurrence claim their deci&para;<br>sions to be narrow ones, but both invite a host of line&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v. FLORIDA&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>drawing problems to which courts must seek answers&para;<br>beyond the strictures of the Constitution. The Court holds&para;<br>that “[a] State is not required to guarantee eventual free&para;<br>dom to a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide&para;<br>crime,” but must provide the offender with “some mean&para;<br>ingful opportunity to obtain release based on demon&para;<br>strated maturity and rehabilitation.” Ante, at 24. But&para;<br>what, exactly, does such a “meaningful” opportunity en&para;<br>tail? When must it occur? And what Eighth Amendment&para;<br>principles will govern review by the parole boards the&para;<br>Court now demands that States empanel? The Court&para;<br>provides no answers to these questions, which will no&para;<br>doubt embroil the courts for years.13&para;<br>V&para;<br>The ultimate question in this case is not whether a life&para;<br>without-parole sentence ‘fits’ the crime at issue here or the&para;<br>crimes of juvenile nonhomicide offenders more generally,&para;<br>but to whom the Constitution assigns that decision. The&para;<br>Florida Legislature has concluded that such sentences&para;<br>should be available for persons under 18 who commit&para;<br>certain crimes, and the trial judge in this case decided to&para;<br>impose that legislatively authorized sentence here. Be&para;<br>cause a life-without-parole prison sentence is not a “cruel&para;<br>and unusual” method of punishment under any standard,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 It bears noting that Colorado, one of the five States that prohibit&para;<br>life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders,&para;<br>permits such offenders to be sentenced to mandatory terms of impris&para;<br>onment for up to 40 years. Colo. Rev. Stat. §18–1.3–401(4)(b) (2009).&para;<br>In light of the volume of state and federal legislation that presently&para;<br>permits life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offend&para;<br>ers, it would be impossible to argue that there is any objective evidence&para;<br>of agreement that a juvenile is constitutionally entitled to a parole&para;<br>hearing any sooner than 40 years after conviction. See Tr. of Oral Arg.&para;<br>6–7 (counsel for Graham, stating that, “[o]ur position is that it should&para;<br>be left up to the States to decide. We think that the . . . Colorado&para;<br>provision would probably be constitutional”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>29&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the Eighth Amendment gives this Court no authority to&para;<br>reject those judgments.&para;<br>It would be unjustifiable for the Court to declare other&para;<br>wise even if it could claim that a bare majority of state laws&para;<br>supported its independent moral view. The fact that the&para;<br>Court categorically prohibits life-without-parole sentences&para;<br>for juvenile nonhomicide offenders in the face of an over&para;<br>whelming legislative majority in favor of leaving that sen&para;<br>tencing option available under certain cases simply illus&para;<br>trates how far beyond any cognizable constitutional&para;<br>principle the Court has reached to ensure that its own&para;<br>sense of morality and retributive justice pre-empts that of&para;<br>the people and their representatives.&para;<br>I agree with JUSTICE STEVENS that “[w]e learn, some&para;<br>times, from our mistakes.” Ante, at 1 (concurring opinion).&para;<br>Perhaps one day the Court will learn from this one.&para;<br>I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

I write separately to make two points.&para;<br>First, the Court holds only that “for a juvenile offender&para;<br>who did not commit homicide the Eighth Amendment&para;<br>forbids the sentence of life without parole.” Ante, at 24&para;<br>(emphasis added). Nothing in the Court’s opinion affects&para;<br>the imposition of a sentence to a term of years without the&para;<br>possibility of parole. Indeed, petitioner conceded at oral&para;<br>argument that a sentence of as much as 40 years without&para;<br>the possibility of parole “probably” would be constitu&para;<br>tional. Tr. of Oral Arg. 6–7; see also ante, at 28, n. 12&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., dissenting).&para;<br>Second, the question whether petitioner’s sentence&para;<br>violates the narrow, as-applied proportionality principle&para;<br>that applies to noncapital sentences is not properly before&para;<br>us in this case. Although petitioner asserted an as-applied&para;<br>proportionality challenge to his sentence before the Flor&para;<br>ida courts, see 982 So. 2d 43, 51–53 (Fla. App. 2008), he&para;<br>did not include an as-applied claim in his petition for&para;<br>certiorari or in his merits briefs before this Court. In&para;<br>stead, petitioner argued for only a categorical rule banning&para;<br>the imposition of life without parole on any juvenile con&para;<br>victed of a nonhomicide offense. Because petitioner aban&para;<br>doned his as-applied claim, I would not reach that issue.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GRAHAM v.
