Argued November 30, 2011—Decided March 28, 2012&para;<br>Respondent Cooper, a licensed pilot, failed to disclose his human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at a time when the agency did not issue medical certificates, which are required to operate an aircraft, to persons with&para;<br>HIV. Subsequently, respondent applied to the Social Security Administration (SSA) and received long-term disability benefits on the&para;<br>basis of his HIV status. Thereafter, he renewed his certificate with&para;<br>the FAA on several occasions, each time intentionally withholding information about his condition. The Department of Transportation&para;<br>(DOT), the FAA’s parent agency, launched a joint criminal investigation with the SSA to identify medically unfit individuals who had obtained FAA certifications. The DOT provided the SSA with the&para;<br>names of licensed pilots, and the SSA, in turn, provided the DOT&para;<br>with a spreadsheet containing information on those pilots who had&para;<br>also received disability benefits. Respondent’s name appeared on the&para;<br>spreadsheet, and an investigation led to his admission that he had&para;<br>intentionally withheld information about his HIV status from the&para;<br>FAA. His pilot certificate was revoked, and he was indicted for making false statements to a Government agency. He pleaded guilty and&para;<br>was fined and sentenced to probation. He then filed suit, alleging&para;<br>that the FAA, DOT, and SSA violated the Privacy Act of 1974, which&para;<br>contains a detailed set of requirements for the management of records held by Executive Branch agencies. The Act allows an aggrieved&para;<br>individual to sue for “actual damages,” 5 U. S. C. §552a(g)(4)(A), if&para;<br>the Government intentionally or willfully violates the Act’s requirements in such a way as to adversely affect the individual. Specifically, respondent claimed that the unlawful disclosure to the DOT of his&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FAA v. COOPER&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>confidential medical information had caused him mental and emotional distress. The District Court concluded that the Government&para;<br>had violated the Act. But, finding the term “actual damages” ambiguous, the court relied on the sovereign immunity canon, which provides that sovereign immunity waivers must be strictly construed in&para;<br>the Government’s favor, to hold that the Act does not authorize the&para;<br>recovery of nonpecuniary damages. Reversing the District Court, the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit concluded that “actual damages” in the Act is not ambiguous and includes damages for mental and emotional distress.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The Privacy Act does not unequivocally authorize damages for&para;<br>mental or emotional distress and therefore does not waive the Government’s sovereign immunity from liability for such harms. Pp. 4–&para;<br>19.&para;<br>(a) A waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text, see e.g., Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187, 192,&para;<br>and any ambiguities are to be construed in favor of immunity, United&para;<br>States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531. Ambiguity exists if there is a&para;<br>plausible interpretation of the statute that would not allow money&para;<br>damages against the Government. United States v. Nordic Village,&para;<br>Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 37. Pp. 5–6.&para;<br>(b) The term “actual damages” in the Privacy Act is a legal term of&para;<br>art, and Congress, when it employs a term of art, “ ‘presumably&para;<br>knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken,’ ” Molzof&para;<br>v. United States, 502 U. S. 301, 307. Even as a legal term, the precise&para;<br>meaning of “actual damages” is far from clear. Although the term is&para;<br>sometimes understood to include nonpecuniary harm, it has also been&para;<br>used or construed more narrowly to cover damages for only pecuniary&para;<br>harm. Because of the term’s chameleon-like quality, it must be considered in the particular context in which it appears. Pp. 6–9.&para;<br>(c) The Privacy Act serves interests similar to those protected by&para;<br>defamation and privacy torts. Its remedial provision, under which&para;<br>plaintiffs can recover a minimum award of $1,000 if they first prove&para;<br>at least some “actual damages,” “parallels” the common-law torts of&para;<br>libel per quod and slander, under which plaintiffs can recover “general damages” if they first prove “special damages.” Doe v. Chao, 540&para;<br>U. S. 614, 625. “Special damages” are limited to actual pecuniary&para;<br>loss, which must be specially pleaded and proved. “General damages” cover nonpecuniary loss and need not be pleaded or proved. This&para;<br>parallel suggests the possibility that Congress intended the term “actual damages” to mean “special damages,” thus barring Privacy Act&para;<br>victims from any recovery unless they can first show some actual pecuniary harm. That Congress would choose “actual damages” instead&para;<br>of “special damages” is not without precedent, as the terms have oc-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>casionally been used interchangeably. Furthermore, any doubt about&para;<br>the plausibility of construing “actual damages” as special damages in&para;<br>the Privacy Act is put to rest by Congress’ deliberate refusal to allow&para;<br>recovery for “general damages.” In common-law defamation and privacy cases, special damages is the only category of compensatory&para;<br>damages other than general damages. Because Congress declined to&para;<br>authorize general damages, it is reasonable to infer that Congress intended the term “actual damages” in the Act to mean special damages for proven pecuniary loss. Pp. 9–14.&para;<br>(d) Although the contrary reading of the Privacy Act accepted by&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit and advanced by respondent is not inconceivable, it&para;<br>is plausible to read the Act as authorizing only damages for economic&para;<br>loss. Because Congress did not speak unequivocally, the Court&para;<br>adopts an interpretation of “actual damages” limited to proven pecuniary harm. To do otherwise would expand the scope of Congress’&para;<br>sovereign immunity waiver beyond what the statutory text clearly&para;<br>requires. P. 14.&para;<br>(e) Respondent raises several counterarguments: (1) common-law&para;<br>cases often define “actual damages” to mean all compensatory damages; (2) the elimination of “general damages” from the Privacy Act&para;<br>means that there can be no recovery for presumed damages, but&para;<br>plaintiffs can still recover for proven mental and emotional distress;&para;<br>(3) because some courts have construed “actual damages” in similar&para;<br>statutes to include mental and emotional distress, Congress must&para;<br>have intended “actual damages” in the Act to include mental and&para;<br>emotional distress as well; and (4) precluding nonpecuniary damages&para;<br>would lead to absurd results, thereby frustrating the Act’s remedial&para;<br>purpose. None of these arguments overcomes the sovereign immunity canon. Pp. 14–19.&para;<br>622 F. 3d 1016, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

When applying for renewal, pilots&para;<br>must disclose any illnesses, disabilities, or surgeries they&para;<br>have had, and they must identify any medications they are&para;<br>taking. See 14 CFR pt. 67.&para;<br>Respondent Stanmore Cooper has been a private pilot&para;<br>since 1964. In 1985, he was diagnosed with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and began taking&para;<br>antiretroviral medication. At that time, the FAA did not&para;<br>issue medical certificates to persons with respondent’s&para;<br>condition. Knowing that he would not qualify for renewal&para;<br>of his medical certificate, respondent initially grounded&para;<br>himself and chose not to apply. In 1994, however, he applied for and received a medical certificate, but he did so&para;<br>without disclosing his HIV status or his medication. He&para;<br>renewed his certificate in 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004,&para;<br>each time intentionally withholding information about his&para;<br>condition.&para;<br>When respondent’s health deteriorated in 1995, he&para;<br>applied for long-term disability benefits under Title II of&para;<br>the Social Security Act, 42 U.

To sub­&para;<br>stantiate his claim, he disclosed his HIV status to the&para;<br>Social Security Administration (SSA), which awarded him&para;<br>benefits for the year from August 1995 to August 1996.&para;<br>In 2002, the Department of Transportation (DOT), the&para;<br>FAA’s parent agency, launched a joint criminal investiga­&para;<br>tion with the SSA, known as “Operation Safe Pilot,” to&para;<br>identify medically unfit individuals who had obtained FAA&para;<br>certifications to fly. The DOT gave the SSA a list of names&para;<br>and other identifying information of 45,000 licensed pilots&para;<br>in northern California. The SSA then compared the list&para;<br>with its own records of benefit recipients and compiled a&para;<br>spreadsheet, which it gave to the DOT.&para;<br>The spreadsheet revealed that respondent had a current&para;<br>medical certificate but had also received disability bene­&para;<br>fits.

Because of&para;<br>these fraudulent omissions, the FAA revoked respondent’s&para;<br>pilot certificate, and he was indicted on three counts of&para;<br>making false statements to a Government agency, in&para;<br>violation of 18 U. S. C. §1001. Respondent ultimately&para;<br>pleaded guilty to one count of making and delivering a&para;<br>false official writing, in violation of §1018. He was sen­&para;<br>tenced to two years of probation and fined $1,000.1&para;<br>Claiming that the FAA, DOT, and SSA (hereinafter&para;<br>Government) violated the Privacy Act by sharing his&para;<br>records with one another, respondent filed suit in the&para;<br>United States District Court for the Northern District of&para;<br>California. He alleged that the unlawful disclosure to the&para;<br>DOT of his confidential medical information, including his&para;<br>HIV status, had caused him “humiliation, embarrassment,&para;<br>mental anguish, fear of social ostracism, and other severe&para;<br>emotional distress.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 120a. Notably,&para;<br>he did not allege any pecuniary or economic loss.&para;<br>The District Court granted summary judgment against&para;<br>respondent. 816 F. Supp. 2d 778, 781 (2008).

Brief for Respondent 5, n. 1.&para;<br>2 With certain exceptions, it is unlawful for an agency to disclose a&para;<br>record to another agency without the written consent of the person to&para;<br>whom the record pertains. 5 U.

COOPER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>held that respondent could not recover damages because&para;<br>he alleged only mental and emotional harm, not economic&para;<br>loss. Finding that the term “actual damages” is “facially&para;<br>ambiguous,” id., at 791, and relying on the sovereign&para;<br>immunity canon, which provides that waivers of sovereign&para;<br>immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the Gov­&para;<br>ernment, the court concluded that the Act does not author­&para;<br>ize the recovery of damages from the Government for&para;<br>nonpecuniary mental or emotional harm.&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir­&para;<br>cuit reversed and remanded. 622 F. 3d 1016, 1024 (2010).&para;<br>The court acknowledged that the term “actual damages”&para;<br>is a “ ‘chameleon’ ” in that “its meaning changes with the&para;<br>specific statute in which it is found.” Id., at 1029. But the&para;<br>court nevertheless held that, as used in the Privacy Act,&para;<br>the term includes damages for mental and emotional&para;<br>distress. Looking to what it described as “[i]ntrinsic” and&para;<br>“[e]xtrinsic” sources, id., at 1028, 1031, the court concluded&para;<br>that the meaning of “actual damages” in the Privacy&para;<br>Act is not ambiguous and that “a construction that limits&para;<br>recovery to pecuniary loss” is not “plausible,” id., at 1034.&para;<br>The Government petitioned for rehearing or rehearing&para;<br>en banc, but a divided court denied the petition. Id., at&para;<br>1019. The Government then petitioned for certiorari, and&para;<br>we granted review. 564 U. S. ___ (2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Because respondent seeks to recover monetary compen­&para;<br>sation from the Government for mental and emotional&para;<br>harm, we must decide whether the civil remedies provi­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>nondisclosure requirement applies when the head of an agency makes a&para;<br>written request for law enforcement purposes to the agency that&para;<br>maintains the record. See §552a(b)(7). The agencies in this case could&para;<br>easily have shared respondent’s medical records pursuant to the&para;<br>procedures prescribed by the Privacy Act, but the District Court con­&para;<br>cluded that they failed to do so.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sion of the Privacy Act waives the Government’s sovereign&para;<br>immunity with respect to such a recovery.&para;<br>A&para;<br>We have said on many occasions that a waiver of sover­&para;<br>eign immunity must be “unequivocally expressed” in&para;<br>statutory text. See, e.g., Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187, 192&para;<br>(1996); United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30,&para;<br>33 (1992); Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498&para;<br>U. S. 89, 95 (1990). Legislative history cannot supply a&para;<br>waiver that is not clearly evident from the language of&para;<br>the statute. Lane, supra, at 192. Any ambiguities in the&para;<br>statutory language are to be construed in favor of immunity, United States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531 (1995),&para;<br>so that the Government’s consent to be sued is never enlarged beyond what a fair reading of the text requires,&para;<br>Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 685–686 (1983)&para;<br>(citing Eastern Transp. Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 675,&para;<br>686 (1927)). Ambiguity exists if there is a plausible inter­&para;<br>pretation of the statute that would not authorize money&para;<br>damages against the Government. Nordic Village, supra,&para;<br>at 34, 37.&para;<br>The question that confronts us here is not whether&para;<br>Congress has consented to be sued for damages under the&para;<br>Privacy Act. That much is clear from the statute, which&para;<br>expressly authorizes recovery from the Government for&para;<br>“actual damages.” Rather, the question at issue concerns&para;<br>the scope of that waiver. For the same reason that we&para;<br>refuse to enforce a waiver that is not unambiguously&para;<br>expressed in the statute, we also construe any ambiguities&para;<br>in the scope of a waiver in favor of the sovereign. Lane,&para;<br>supra, at 192.&para;<br>Although this canon of interpretation requires an un­&para;<br>mistakable statutory expression of congressional intent to&para;<br>waive the Government’s immunity, Congress need not&para;<br>state its intent in any particular way. We have never&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>FAA v. COOPER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>required that Congress use magic words. To the contrary,&para;<br>we have observed that the sovereign immunity canon “is&para;<br>a tool for interpreting the law” and that it does not “dis­&para;<br>plac[e] the other traditional tools of statutory construc­&para;<br>tion.” Richlin Security Service Co. v. Chertoff, 553 U. S.&para;<br>571, 589 (2008). What we thus require is that the scope of&para;<br>Congress’ waiver be clearly discernable from the statutory&para;<br>text in light of traditional interpretive tools. If it is not,&para;<br>then we take the interpretation most favorable to the&para;<br>Government.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The civil remedies provision of the Privacy Act provides&para;<br>that, for any “intentional or willful” refusal or failure to&para;<br>comply with the Act, the United States shall be liable for&para;<br>“actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of&para;<br>the refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled&para;<br>to recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000.” 5 U. S. C.&para;<br>§552a(g)(4)(A). Because Congress did not define “actual&para;<br>damages,” respondent urges us to rely on the ordinary&para;<br>meaning of the word “actual” as it is defined in standard&para;<br>general-purpose dictionaries. But as the Court of Appeals&para;<br>explained, “actual damages” is a legal term of art, 622&para;<br>F. 3d, at 1028, and it is a “cardinal rule of statutory con­&para;<br>struction” that, when Congress employs a term of art, “ ‘it&para;<br>presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that&para;<br>were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learn­&para;<br>ing from which it was taken,’ ” Molzof v. United States, 502&para;<br>U. S. 301, 307 (1992) (quoting Morissette v. United States,&para;<br>342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952)).&para;<br>Even as a legal term, however, the meaning of “actual&para;<br>damages” is far from clear. The latest edition of Black’s&para;<br>Law Dictionary available when Congress enacted the&para;<br>Privacy Act defined “actual damages” as “[r]eal, substan­&para;<br>tial and just damages, or the amount awarded to a com­&para;<br>plainant in compensation for his actual and real loss or&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>injury, as opposed on the one hand to ‘nominal’ damages,&para;<br>and on the other to ‘exemplary’ or ‘punitive’ damages.”&para;<br>Black’s Law Dictionary 467 (rev. 4th ed. 1968). But this&para;<br>general (and notably circular) definition is of little value&para;<br>here because, as the Court of Appeals accurately observed,&para;<br>the precise meaning of the term “changes with the specific&para;<br>statute in which it is found.” 622 F. 3d, at 1029.&para;<br>The term is sometimes understood to include nonpecu­&para;<br>niary harm. Take, for instance, some courts’ interpreta­&para;<br>tions of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), 42 U. S. C. §3613(c),&para;<br>and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§1681n, 1681o. A number of courts have construed “ac­&para;<br>tual” damages in the remedial provisions of both statutes&para;<br>to include compensation for mental and emotional dis­&para;<br>tress. See, e.g., Seaton v. Sky Realty Co., 491 F. 2d 634,&para;<br>636–638 (CA7 1974) (authorizing compensatory damages&para;<br>under the FHA, 42 U. S. C. §3612, the predecessor to&para;<br>§3613, for humiliation); Steele v. Title Realty Co., 478 F. 2d&para;<br>380, 384 (CA10 1973) (stating that damages under the&para;<br>FHA “are not limited to out-of-pocket losses but may&para;<br>include an award for emotional distress and humiliation”);&para;<br>Thompson v. San Antonio Retail Merchants Assn., 682&para;<br>F. 2d 509, 513–514 (CA5 1982) (per curiam) (explaining&para;<br>that, “[e]ven when there are no out-of-pocket expenses,&para;<br>humiliation and mental distress do constitute recoverable&para;<br>elements of damage” under the FCRA); Millstone v.&para;<br>O’Hanlon Reports, Inc., 528 F. 2d 829, 834–835 (CA8 1976)&para;<br>(approving an award of damages under the FCRA for “loss&para;<br>of sleep, nervousness, frustration and mental anguish”).&para;<br>In other contexts, however, the term has been used or&para;<br>construed more narrowly to authorize damages for only&para;<br>pecuniary harm. In the wrongful-death provision of the&para;<br>Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), for example, Congress&para;<br>authorized “actual or compensatory damages, measured&para;<br>by the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death.” 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2674, ¶2. At least one court has defined “actual&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FAA v. COOPER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>damages” in the Copyright Act of 1909, 17 U. S. C. §101(b)&para;<br>(1970 ed.), as “the extent to which the market value of&para;<br>a copyrighted work has been injured or destroyed by an&para;<br>infringement.” Frank Music Corp. v. Metro-GoldwynMayer, Inc., 772 F. 2d 505, 512 (CA9 1985); see also&para;<br>Mackie v. Rieser, 296 F. 3d 909, 917 (CA9 2002) (holding&para;<br>that “ ‘hurt feelings’ over the nature of the infringement”&para;<br>have no place in the actual damages calculus). And some&para;<br>courts have construed “actual damages” in the Securities&para;<br>Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. §78bb(a), to mean “some&para;<br>form of economic loss.” Ryan v. Foster &amp; Marshall, Inc.,&para;<br>556 F. 2d 460, 464 (CA9 1977); see also Osofsky v. Zipf,&para;<br>645 F. 2d 107, 111 (CA2 1981) (stating that the purpose of&para;<br>§78bb(a) “is to compensate civil plaintiffs for economic loss&para;<br>suffered as a result of wrongs committed in violation of the&para;<br>1934 Act”); Herpich v. Wallace, 430 F. 2d 792, 810 (CA5&para;<br>1970) (noting that the “gist” of an action for damages&para;<br>under the Act is “economic injury”).3&para;<br>Because the term “actual damages” has this chameleon­&para;<br>like quality, we cannot rely on any all-purpose definition&para;<br>but must consider the particular context in which the term&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 This narrow usage is reflected in contemporaneous state-court deci­&para;<br>sions as well. See, e.g., Reist v. Manwiller, 231 Pa. Super. 444, 449,&para;<br>n. 4, 332 A. 2d 518, 520, n. 4 (1974) (explaining that recovery for&para;<br>intentional infliction of emotional distress is allowed “despite the total&para;<br>absence of physical injury and actual damages”); Nalder v. Crest Corp.,&para;<br>93 Idaho 744, 749, 472 P. 2d 310, 315 (1970) (noting that damages for&para;<br>“mental anguish” due to the wrongful execution of a judgment “are&para;<br>allowable only as an element of punitive but not of actual damages”).

Upon&para;<br>showing some pecuniary harm, no matter how slight, they&para;<br>can recover the statutory minimum of $1,000, presumably&para;<br>for any unproven harm. That Congress would choose to&para;<br>use the term “actual damages” instead of “special damages”&para;<br>was not without precedent. The terms had occasionally&para;<br>been used interchangeably.

Although the Commission later recommended that general damages be allowed, ibid., n. 4,&para;<br>Congress never amended the Act to include them.

Id., at 622.&para;<br>By authorizing recovery for “actual” but not for “gen­&para;<br>eral” damages, Congress made clear that it viewed those&para;<br>terms as mutually exclusive. In actions for defamation&para;<br>and related dignitary torts, two categories of compensatory damages are recoverable: general damages and special&para;<br>damages. Cooley §164, at 579; see also 4 Restatement&para;<br>§867, Comment d (1939) (noting that damages for inter­&para;<br>ference with privacy “can be awarded in the same way in&para;<br>which general damages are given for defamation”).9 Be­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent disregards these precedents as the product of careless&para;<br>imprecision.

COOPER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>D&para;<br>We do not claim that the contrary reading of the statute&para;<br>accepted by the Court of Appeals and advanced now by&para;<br>respondent is inconceivable. But because the Privacy Act&para;<br>waives the Federal Government’s sovereign immunity, the&para;<br>question we must answer is whether it is plausible to read&para;<br>the statute, as the Government does, to authorize only&para;<br>damages for economic loss. Nordic Village, 503 U. S., at&para;<br>34, 37. When waiving the Government’s sovereign im­&para;<br>munity, Congress must speak unequivocally. Lane, 518&para;<br>U. S., at 192. Here, we conclude that it did not. As a&para;<br>consequence, we adopt an interpretation of “actual dam­&para;<br>ages” limited to proven pecuniary or economic harm.

See Brief&para;<br>for Respondent 18–25. For example, in Birdsall v. Coo­&para;<br>lidge, 93 U. S. 64 (1876), a patent infringement case, we&para;<br>observed that “[c]ompensatory damages and actual dam­&para;<br>ages mean the same thing.” Ibid. And in Gertz v. Robert&para;<br>Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974), we wrote that actual&para;<br>injury in the defamation context “is not limited to out-of­&para;<br>pocket loss” and that it customarily includes “impairment&para;<br>of reputation and standing in the community, personal&para;<br>humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering.” Id., at&para;<br>350.&para;<br>These cases and others cited by respondent stand for the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

But this generic meaning does&para;<br>not establish with the requisite clarity that the Privacy&para;<br>Act, with its distinctive features, authorizes damages for&para;<br>mental and emotional distress. As we already explained,&para;<br>the term “actual damages” takes on different meanings in&para;<br>different contexts.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Respondent’s stronger argument is that the exclusion of&para;<br>“general damages” from the statute simply means that&para;<br>there can be no recovery for presumed damages. Privacy&para;<br>Act victims can still recover for mental and emotional&para;<br>distress, says respondent, so long as it is proved. See Brief&para;<br>for Respondent 54–56.10&para;<br>This argument is flawed because it suggests that proven&para;<br>mental and emotional distress does not count as general&para;<br>damages. The term “general damages” is not limited to&para;<br>compensation for unproven injuries; it includes compensa­&para;<br>tion for proven injuries as well. See 3 Restatement §621,&para;<br>Comment a (noting that general damages compensate for&para;<br>“harm which . . . is proved, or, in the absence of proof,&para;<br>is assumed to have caused to [the plaintiff’s] reputation”).&para;<br>To be sure, specific proof of emotional harm is not required&para;<br>to recover general damages for dignitary torts. Dobbs&para;<br>§7.3, at 529. But it does not follow that general damages&para;<br>cannot be recovered for emotional harm that is actually&para;<br>proved.&para;<br>Aside from the fact that general damages need not be&para;<br>proved, what distinguishes those damages, whether&para;<br>proved or not, from the only other category of compensatory damages available in the relevant common-law suits is&para;<br>the type of harm. In defamation and privacy cases, “the&para;<br>affront to the plaintiff’s dignity and the emotional harm&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent advances the same argument. See post, at 9–11.&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>FAA v.

Therefore, the converse of general&para;<br>damages is special damages, not all proven damages, as&para;<br>respondent would have it. Because Congress removed&para;<br>“general damages” from the Act’s remedial provision, it is&para;<br>reasonable to infer that Congress foreclosed recovery for&para;<br>nonpecuniary harm, even if such harm can be proved, and&para;<br>instead waived the Government’s sovereign immunity only&para;<br>with respect to harm compensable as special damages.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Looking beyond the Privacy Act’s text, respondent&para;<br>points to the use of the term “actual” damages in the&para;<br>remedial provisions of the FHA, 42 U. S. C. §3613(c), and&para;<br>the FCRA, 15 U. S. C. §§1681n, 1681o. As previously&para;<br>mentioned, courts have held that “actual” damages within&para;<br>the meaning of these statutes include compensation for&para;<br>mental and emotional distress. Supra, at 7. Citing the&para;<br>rule of construction that Congress intends the same lan­&para;<br>guage in similar statutes to have the same meaning, see&para;<br>Northcross v. Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools, 412&para;<br>U. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per curiam), respondent argues that&para;<br>the Privacy Act should also be interpreted as authorizing&para;<br>damages for mental and emotional distress. See Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 25–32.&para;<br>Assuming for the sake of argument that these lower&para;<br>court decisions are correct, they provide only weak support&para;<br>for respondent’s argument here. Since the term “actual&para;<br>damages” can mean different things in different contexts,&para;<br>statutes other than the Privacy Act provide only limited&para;<br>interpretive aid, and that is especially true here. Neither&para;<br>the FHA nor the FCRA contains text that precisely mir­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rors the Privacy Act.11 In neither of those statutes did&para;<br>Congress specifically decline to authorize recovery for&para;<br>general damages as it did in the Privacy Act. Supra, at&para;<br>12–13. And most importantly, none of the lower court&para;<br>cases interpreting the statutes, which respondent has&para;<br>cited, see Brief for Respondent 29–31, involves the sover­&para;<br>eign immunity canon.&para;<br>Respondent also points to the FTCA, but the FTCA’s&para;<br>general liability provision does not even use the term&para;<br>“actual damages.” It instead provides that the “United&para;<br>States shall be liable” for certain tort claims “in the same&para;<br>manner and to the same extent as a private individual”&para;<br>under relevant state law. 28 U. S. C. §2674, ¶1. For that&para;<br>reason alone, the FTCA’s general liability provision is not&para;<br>a reliable source for interpreting the term “actual damages”&para;<br>in the Privacy Act. Nor does the FTCA’s wrongful­&para;<br>death provision—which authorizes “actual or compensatory damages, measured by the pecuniary injuries resulting&para;<br>from such death,” §2674, ¶2—prove that Congress under­&para;<br>stood the term “actual damages” in the Privacy Act to&para;<br>include nonpecuniary mental and emotional harm. To the&para;<br>contrary, it proves that actual damages can be understood&para;<br>to entail only pecuniary harm depending on the context.&para;<br>Because the FTCA, like the FHA and FCRA, does not&para;<br>share the same text or design as the Privacy Act, it is not&para;<br>a fitting analog for construing the Act.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>11 Compare&para;<br>&para;<br>42 U.

COOPER&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>D&para;<br>Finally, respondent argues that excluding damages for&para;<br>mental and emotional harm would lead to absurd results.&para;<br>Persons suffering relatively minor pecuniary loss would&para;<br>be entitled to recover $1,000, while others suffering only&para;<br>severe and debilitating mental or emotional distress would&para;<br>get nothing. See Brief for Respondent 33–35.&para;<br>Contrary to respondent’s suggestion, however, there is&para;<br>nothing absurd about a scheme that limits the Govern­&para;<br>ment’s Privacy Act liability to harm that can be substanti­&para;<br>ated by proof of tangible economic loss. Respondent in­&para;<br>sists that such a scheme would frustrate the Privacy Act’s&para;<br>remedial purpose, but that ignores the fact that, by delib­&para;<br>erately refusing to authorize general damages, Congress&para;<br>intended to cabin relief, not to maximize it.12&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 Despite its rhetoric, the dissent does not dispute most of the steps&para;<br>in our analysis. For example, although the dissent belittles the sover­&para;<br>eign immunity canon, the dissent does not call for its abandonment.&para;<br>See post, at 2–3. Nor does the dissent point out any error in our under­&para;<br>standing of the canon’s meaning. See ibid. The dissent acknowledges&para;<br>that statutes and judicial opinions sometimes use the term “actual&para;<br>damages” to mean pecuniary harm, see post, at 5, and that determining&para;<br>its meaning in a particular statute requires consideration of context,&para;<br>see ibid. In addition, the dissent concedes—as it must in light of our&para;<br>reasoning in Doe v. Chao, 540 U. S. 614 (2004)—that the common law&para;<br>of defamation has relevance in construing the term “actual damages” in&para;<br>the Privacy Act. See post, at 7–9.&para;<br>The dissent’s argument thus boils down to this: The text and purpose&para;<br>of the Privacy Act make it clear beyond any reasonable dispute that the&para;<br>term “actual damages,” as used in the Act, means compensatory dam­&para;<br>ages for all proven harm and not just damages for pecuniary harm.&para;<br>The dissent reasons that, because the Act seeks to prevent pecuniary&para;<br>and nonpecuniary harm, Congress must have intended to authorize the&para;<br>recovery of money damages from the Federal Government for both&para;<br>types of harm. This inference is plausible, but it surely is not unavoid­&para;<br>able. The Act deters violations of its substantive provisions in other&para;<br>ways—for instance, by permitting recovery for economic injury; by&para;<br>imposing criminal sanctions for some violations, see 5 U.

To that end, the Act provides a civil&para;<br>remedy entitling individuals adversely affected by certain&para;<br>agency misconduct to recover “actual damages” sustained&para;<br>as a result of the unlawful action.&para;<br>Today the Court holds that “actual damages” is limited&para;<br>to pecuniary loss. Consequently, individuals can no longer&para;<br>recover what our precedents and common sense understand to be the primary, and often only, damages sustained as a result of an invasion of privacy, namely mental&para;<br>or emotional distress. That result is at odds with the text,&para;<br>structure, and drafting history of the Act. And it cripples&para;<br>the Act’s core purpose of redressing and deterring violations of privacy interests. I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The majority concludes that “actual damages” in the&para;<br>civil-remedies provision of the Privacy Act allows recovery&para;<br>for pecuniary loss alone. But it concedes that its interpretation is not compelled by the plain text of the statute or&para;<br>otherwise required by any other traditional tool of statu-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>FAA v. COOPER&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tory interpretation. And it candidly acknowledges that a&para;<br>contrary reading is not “inconceivable.” Ante, at 14. Yet because it considers its reading of “actual damages” to be&para;<br>“plausible,” the majority contends that the canon of sovereign immunity requires adoption of an interpretation most&para;<br>favorable to the Government. Ibid.&para;<br>The canon simply cannot bear the weight the majority&para;<br>ascribes it. “The sovereign immunity canon is just that—a&para;<br>canon of construction. It is a tool for interpreting the law,&para;<br>and we have never held that it displaces the other traditional tools of statutory construction.” Richlin Security&para;<br>Service Co. v. Chertoff, 553 U. S. 571, 589 (2008) (opinion&para;<br>of ALITO, J.). Here, traditional tools of statutory construction—the statute’s text, structure, drafting history, and&para;<br>purpose—provide a clear answer: The term “actual damages” permits recovery for all injuries established by&para;<br>competent evidence in the record, whether pecuniary or&para;<br>nonpecuniary, and so encompasses damages for mental&para;<br>and emotional distress. There is no need to seek refuge in&para;<br>a canon of construction, see id., at 589–590 (declining to&para;<br>rely on canon as there is “no ambiguity left for us to construe” after application of “traditional tools of statutory&para;<br>interpretation and considerations of stare decisis”), much&para;<br>less one that has been used so haphazardly in the Court’s&para;<br>history, see United States v.

Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 475 (1992). The language of the&para;<br>civil-remedies provision of the Privacy Act is clear.&para;<br>At the time Congress drafted the Act, Black’s Law Dictionary defined “actual damages” as “[r]eal, substantial&para;<br>and just damages, or the amount awarded to a complainant in compensation for his actual and real loss or injury” and as “[s]ynonymous with ‘compensatory damages.’ ”&para;<br>Black’s Law Dictionary 467 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (hereinafter&para;<br>Black’s). The majority claims this is a “general” and “notably circular” definition, ante, at 7, but it is unclear why.&para;<br>The definition is plain enough: “Actual damages” compensate for actual injury, and thus the term is synonymous&para;<br>with compensatory damages. See Black’s 467 (defining&para;<br>“compensatory damages” as damages that “will compensate the injured party for the injury sustained, and nothing more; such as will simply make good or replace the&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>FAA v. COOPER&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>loss caused by the wrong or injury”).1 There is nothing&para;<br>circular about that definition.2 It is the definition this&para;<br>Court adopted more than a century ago when we recognized that “[c]ompensatory damages and actual damages&para;<br>mean the same thing; that is, that the damages shall be&para;<br>the result of the injury alleged and proved, and that the&para;<br>amount awarded shall be precisely commensurate with&para;<br>the injury suffered.” Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U. S. 64&para;<br>(1876). It is the definition embraced in current legal&para;<br>dictionaries. See Black’s 445 (9th ed. 2009) (defining&para;<br>“actual damages” as “[a]n amount awarded to a complainant to compensate for a proven injury or loss; damages&para;<br>that repay actual losses.—Also termed compensatory&para;<br>damages; tangible damages; real damages” (italics omitted)). And it is the definition that accords with the plain&para;<br>and ordinary meaning of the term. See Webster’s Third&para;<br>New International Dictionary 22, 571 (2002) (defining&para;<br>“actual” as “existing in fact or reality” and “damages” as&para;<br>“compensation or satisfaction imposed by law for a wrong&para;<br>or injury caused by a violation of a legal right”). Thus,&para;<br>both as a term of art and in its plain meaning, “actual&para;<br>damages” connotes compensation for proven injuries or&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Black’s Law Dictionary also defined “actual damages” as synonymous with “general damages.” Black’s 467. While “general damages”&para;<br>has a specialized meaning of presumed damages in libel and slander&para;<br>cases, see n. 4, infra, it more generally can mean damages that “did in&para;<br>fact result from the wrong, directly and proximately.” Black’s 468.&para;<br>2 The majority declares the definition circular because “defining ‘actual’ damages by reference to ‘actual’ injury is hardly helpful when our&para;<br>task is to determine what Congress meant by ‘actual.’ ” Ante, at 9, n. 4.&para;<br>“Actual injury,” however, is far from an unhelpful reference. This&para;<br>Court already has recognized in the defamation context that “actual&para;<br>injury is not limited to out-of-pocket loss.” Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,&para;<br>418 U. S. 323, 350 (1974). That accords with the definitions of the&para;<br>terms. See Black’s 53, 924 (defining “actual” as “[r]eal; substantial;&para;<br>existing presently in act, having a valid objective existence as opposed&para;<br>to that which is merely theoretical or possible,” and “injury” as “[a]ny&para;<br>wrong or damage done to another”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>losses. Nothing in the use of that phrase indicates proven&para;<br>injuries need be pecuniary in nature.&para;<br>The majority discards all this on the asserted ground&para;<br>that “the precise meaning of the term ‘changes with the&para;<br>specific statute in which it is found.’ ” Ante, at 7 (quoting&para;<br>622 F. 3d 1016, 1029 (CA9 2010)). Context, of course, is&para;<br>relevant to statutory interpretation; it may provide clues&para;<br>that Congress did not employ a word or phrase in its&para;<br>ordinary meaning. That well-established interpretive rule&para;<br>cannot, however, render irrelevant—as the majority would&para;<br>have it—the ordinary meaning of “actual damages.”&para;<br>Moreover, the authority the majority cites for its claim&para;<br>that “actual damages” has no fixed meaning undermines—&para;<br>rather than supports—its holding. Each cited authority&para;<br>involves either a statute in which Congress expressly&para;<br>directed that compensation be measured in strictly economic terms, or else a statute (e.g., the Copyright Act of&para;<br>1909) in which economic loss is the natural and probable&para;<br>consequence of a violation of the defined legal interest.3&para;<br>Neither factor is present here. Notably absent from the&para;<br>Privacy Act is any provision so much as hinting that “actual damages” should be limited to economic loss. And&para;<br>while “ ‘ “hurt feelings” over the nature of the [copyright]&para;<br>infringement’ ” may “have no place in the actual damages&para;<br>calculus” under the Copyright Act of 1909, ante, at 8 (quoting in parenthetical Mackie v. Rieser, 296 F. 3d 909, 917&para;<br>(CA9 2002)), the majority provides no basis for concluding&para;<br>that “hurt feelings” are equally invalid in an Act concerned with safeguarding individual privacy. Thus, while&para;<br>context is no doubt relevant, the majority’s cited authority&para;<br>does little to help its cause in the stated context of this&para;<br>statute.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 See 28 U. S. C. §2674; 17 U. S. C. §1009(d)(1); 18 U. S. C. §2318(e)(3)&para;<br>(2006 ed., Supp. IV); 17 U. S. C. §101(b) (1970 ed.); 15 U. S.

COOPER&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>B&para;<br>Indeed, the relevant statutory context—the substantive&para;<br>provisions whose breach may trigger suit under the civilremedies provision—only reinforces the ordinary meaning&para;<br>of “actual damages.”&para;<br>Congress established substantive duties in the Act that&para;<br>are expressly designed to prevent agency conduct resulting in intangible harms to the individual. The Act requires agencies to “establish appropriate administrative,&para;<br>technical, and physical safeguards” to ensure against&para;<br>security breaches that could result in “substantial harm,&para;<br>embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual.” 5 U. S. C. §552a(e)(10). It also requires agencies&para;<br>to “maintain all records” used in making a determination&para;<br>about an individual in a manner that is “reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination.” §552a(e)(5). Thus an agency violates the terms of&para;<br>the Act if it fails, e.g., to maintain safeguards protecting&para;<br>against “embarrassment”; there is no additional requirement that the pocketbook be implicated. An agency’s&para;<br>intentional or willful violation of those duties triggers&para;<br>liability for “actual damages” under §552a(g)(4) in the&para;<br>event of an adverse impact. §§552a(g)(1)(C)–(D), (g)(4).&para;<br>Adopting a reading of “actual damages” that permits&para;<br>recovery for pecuniary loss alone creates a disconnect&para;<br>between the Act’s substantive and remedial provisions. It&para;<br>allows a swath of Government violations to go unremedied: A federal agency could intentionally or willfully forgo&para;<br>establishing safeguards to protect against embarrassment&para;<br>and no successful private action could be taken against it&para;<br>for the harm Congress identified. Only an interpretation&para;<br>of “actual damages” that permits recovery for nonpecuniary harms harmonizes the Act’s substantive and remedial&para;<br>provisions. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>(1997) (statutory interpretation must consider “the&para;<br>broader context of the statute as a whole”).4&para;<br>The majority draws a different conclusion from the substantive provisions of the Privacy Act. It (correctly) infers from them that the Act “serves interests similar to&para;<br>those protected by defamation and privacy torts.” Ante,&para;<br>at 9. It then points to our observation in Doe v. Chao, 540&para;<br>U. S. 614, 625 (2004), that the Act’s civil-remedies provision “parallels” the remedial scheme for the common-law&para;<br>torts of defamation per quod, which permitted recovery&para;<br>of “general damages” (i.e., presumed damages) only if a&para;<br>plaintiff first establishes “special damages” (i.e., monetary&para;<br>loss).5 Ante, at 10. That “parallel,” the majority concludes, “suggests the possibility that Congress intended&para;<br>the term ‘actual damages’ in the Act to mean special damages.” Ante, at 11.&para;<br>The majority reads too much into Doe. At issue in that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 It bears noting that the Privacy Act does not authorize injunctive&para;<br>relief when a suit is maintained under 5 U. S. C. §§552a(g)(1)(C) and&para;<br>(D). Rather, injunctive relief is available under the Act only for a&para;<br>limited category of suits: suits to amend a record and suits for access to&para;<br>a record. See §§552a(g)(2), (g)(3). Thus an individual who, like petitioner, brings suit under subparagraph (g)(1)(C) or (D) for an intentional or willful violation of the Act will be without a remedy under&para;<br>the majority’s reading of “actual damages.”&para;<br>5 As the majority notes, “general damages” at common law refers to&para;<br>damages “presumed” to accrue from the violation of the legally protected right. No proof of actual injury was required. See D. Dobbs,&para;<br>Law of Remedies §7.2, p. 513 (1973) (hereinafter Dobbs); Doe, 540 U. S.,&para;<br>at 621. “Special damages,” in contrast, “meant monetary loss.” Dobbs §7.2,&para;<br>at 512; Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. Common-law defamation actions falling&para;<br>within the rubric of defamation per se allowed successful plaintiffs to&para;<br>recover “general damages.” See Dobbs §7.2, at 513; Doe, 540 U. S., at&para;<br>621. This stood in contrast to actions sounding in defamation per quod,&para;<br>which permitted recovery only if the plaintiff established “special&para;<br>damages.” See Dobbs, §7.2 at 512; Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. Even in&para;<br>defamation per quod cases, a plaintiff could recover nonpecuniary&para;<br>injuries upon establishing some pecuniary loss. See Dobbs §7.2, at 521;&para;<br>Doe, 540 U. S., at 625. See also ante, at 10.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>FAA v. COOPER&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>case was the question whether the Act’s civil-suit provision authorized recovery of a guaranteed minimum award&para;<br>of $1,000 absent proof of some “actual damages.” The&para;<br>Court answered in the negative, and in the course of doing&para;<br>so replied to petitioner’s argument that there was “something peculiar in offering some guaranteed damages . . .&para;<br>only to those plaintiffs who can demonstrate actual damages.” 540 U. S., at 625. Although the Court cited the&para;<br>Act’s parallels to defamation per quod actions in noting&para;<br>that nothing was “peculiar” about the Act’s remedial&para;<br>scheme, Doe did not take the further step of deciding that&para;<br>“actual damages” means economic loss alone. Indeed, it&para;<br>expressly reserved that question. Id., at 627, n. 12.&para;<br>The majority, moreover, is wrong to conclude that the&para;<br>Act’s parallels with defamation per quod actions suggest&para;<br>Congress intended “actual damages” to mean “special&para;<br>damages.” Quite the opposite. The fact that Congress&para;<br>“would probably have known about” defamation per quod&para;<br>actions, id., at 625, makes it all the more significant that&para;<br>Congress did not write “special damages” in the civilremedies provision. This Court is typically not in the&para;<br>business of substituting words we think Congress intended to use for words Congress in fact used. Yet that is&para;<br>precisely what the majority does when it rewrites “actual&para;<br>damages” to mean “special damages.”6 In sum, the statutory context, and in particular the Act’s substantive provisions, confirms the ordinary meaning of “actual damages.”&para;<br>Although the Act shares parallels with common-law defamation torts, such analogies do not warrant a reading of&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The majority cites a collection of lower court opinions that have used&para;<br>“actual damages” in place of “special damages” to note that Congress&para;<br>would not have been alone in using the former term to refer to the&para;<br>latter. Ante, at 11–12. But that a handful of lower courts on occasion&para;<br>have been imprecise in their terminology provides no basis to assume&para;<br>the Legislature has been equally careless in the text of a statute.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the phrase that is at odds with the statute’s plain text.7&para;<br>C&para;<br>An uncodified provision of the Act, tied to the Act’s&para;<br>drafting history, also reinforces the ordinary meaning of&para;<br>“actual damages.” As the majority notes, prior to reconciliation, the Senate and House bills contained civil-remedies&para;<br>provisions that were different in a critical respect: The&para;<br>Senate bill allowed for the recovery of “actual and general&para;<br>damages,” whereas the House bill allowed for the recovery&para;<br>of “actual damages” alone.8 In the reconciliation process,&para;<br>the provision for “general damages” was dropped and an&para;<br>uncodified section of the Act was amended to require the&para;<br>newly established Privacy Protection Study Commission to&para;<br>consider, among its other jobs, “whether the Federal Government should be liable for general damages incurred by&para;<br>an individual as the result of a willful or intentional violation of the provisions of sections 552a(g)(1)(C) or (D).”&para;<br>§5(c)(2)(B)(iii), 88 Stat. 1907; see also Doe, 540 U. S.,&para;<br>at 622.&para;<br>As the Court explained in Doe, “[t]he deletion of ‘general&para;<br>damages’ from the bill is fairly seen . . . as a deliberate&para;<br>elimination of any possibility of imputing harm and&para;<br>awarding presumed damages.” Id., at 623; see also id., at&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 There is yet another flaw in the majority’s reasoning. At common&para;<br>law a plaintiff who successfully established “special damages” in an&para;<br>action for defamation per quod could proceed to recover damages for&para;<br>emotional and mental distress. See ante, at 10; n. 5, supra. If “Congress intended the term ‘actual damages’ in the Act to mean special&para;<br>damages,” ante, at 11, then an individual who successfully establishes&para;<br>some pecuniary loss from a violation of the Act—presumably as trivial&para;<br>as the cost of a bottle of Tylenol—should be permitted to recover for&para;<br>emotional and mental distress. The majority, of course, does not accept&para;<br>that result, and its piecemeal embrace of the common law undermines&para;<br>its assertion that Congress intended “special damages” in place of&para;<br>“actual damages.”&para;<br>8 See S. 3418, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., §303(c)(1) (1974); H. R. 16373, 93d&para;<br>Cong., 2d Sess., §3 (1974).&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>FAA v. COOPER&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>622, n. 5 (“Congress explicitly rejected the proposal to&para;<br>make presumed damages available for Privacy Act violations”). The elimination of presumed damages from the&para;<br>bill can only reasonably imply that what Congress left&para;<br>behind—“actual damages”—comprised damages that are&para;<br>not presumed, i.e., damages proven by competent evidence&para;<br>in the record. See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S.&para;<br>323, 349–350 (1974) (distinguishing in defamation context&para;<br>between presumed damages and damages for actual injuries sustained by competent evidence in the record, which&para;<br>include “impairment of reputation and standing in the&para;<br>community, personal humiliation, and mental anguish&para;<br>and suffering”); Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 262–264&para;<br>(1978) (distinguishing between presumed damages and&para;<br>proven damages for mental and emotional distress).&para;<br>Rather than view the deletion of general damages (presumed damages) as leaving the converse (proven damages), the majority supposes that the deletion leaves only a&para;<br>subset of proven damages—those of an economic nature,&para;<br>i.e., “special damages.” Once again, however, the majority’s insistence that “Congress intended ‘actual damages’ in&para;<br>the Privacy Act to mean special damages for proven pecuniary loss,” ante, at 13, finds no basis in the statutory text,&para;<br>see supra, at 8. And its response to the conclusion that&para;<br>Congress retained recovery for proven damages when it&para;<br>eliminated presumed damages is singularly unsatisfying.&para;<br>The majority declares such a conclusion “flawed” because&para;<br>“general damages” “includes compensation for proven&para;<br>injuries as well,” so that “what distinguishes [general]&para;<br>damages, whether proved or not, from the only other&para;<br>category of compensatory damages available in the relevant common-law suits is the type of harm” the term&para;<br>encompasses—which the majority takes to be emotional&para;<br>harm alone. Ante, at 15–16. That assertion is defective on&para;<br>two scores. First, a plaintiff ’s ability to present proof of&para;<br>injury in a defamation per se action (and to recover for&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>such proven injury) does not alter the definition of “general damages,” which we already explained in Doe means&para;<br>“presumed damages.” 540 U. S., at 621; see also id., at&para;<br>623; n. 5, supra. Second, “general damages” is not limited&para;<br>to a “type” of harm. The majority’s contrary assertion that&para;<br>the term permits recovery only for emotional “types” of&para;<br>harm overlooks the fact that “general damages are partly&para;<br>based on the belief that the plaintiff will suffer unprovable&para;<br>pecuniary losses.” Dobbs §7.2, at 514 (emphasis added). It&para;<br>thus was established at common law that in a defamation&para;<br>per se action, “the plaintiff is usually free to prove whatever actual pecuniary loss he can,” and “the jury may be&para;<br>permitted to view the actual pecuniary loss proven as the&para;<br>tip of the iceberg, assume that there is still more unproven, and award damage accordingly.” Ibid.&para;<br>At its core, the majority opinion relies on the following&para;<br>syllogism: The common law employed two terms of art in&para;<br>defamation actions. Because Congress excluded recovery&para;<br>for “general damages,” it must have meant to retain recovery only for “special damages.” That syllogism, of course,&para;<br>ignores that there is another category of damages. It is&para;<br>the very category Congress used in the text of the Privacy&para;<br>Act: “Actual damages.” However much Congress may&para;<br>have drawn “parallels,” ante, at 10, between the Act and&para;<br>the common-law tort of defamation, the fact remains that&para;<br>Congress expressly choose not to use the words “special&para;<br>damages.”9&para;<br>D&para;<br>I turn finally to the statute’s purpose, for “[a]s in all&para;<br>cases of statutory interpretation, our task is to interpret&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The majority cites the conclusions of the Privacy Protection Study&para;<br>Commission in support of its interpretation of “actual damages.” The&para;<br>majority rightfully does not claim this piece of postenactment, extratextual material is due any deference; nor do I find its unelaborated&para;<br>conclusions persuasive.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>FAA v.

Identifying the right to&para;<br>privacy as “a personal and fundamental right,” Congress&para;<br>found it “necessary and proper” to enact the Privacy Act&para;<br>“in order to protect the privacy of individuals identified in&para;<br>information systems maintained by Federal agencies.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>Congress explained that the “purpose of this Act is to&para;<br>provide certain safeguards for an individual against an&para;<br>invasion of personal privacy by requiring Federal agencies, except as otherwise provided by law, to,” inter alia,&para;<br>“be subject to civil suit for any damages which occur as a&para;<br>result of willful or intentional action which violates any&para;<br>individual’s rights under this Act.” §2(b)(6), ibid. (emphasis added). That statement is an explicit reference to suits&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>brought under §552a(g)(4); no other provision speaks to a&para;<br>civil suit based on “willful or intentional” agency misconduct. It signals unmistakably congressional recognition&para;<br>that the civil-remedies provision is integral to realizing&para;<br>the Act’s purposes.&para;<br>Reading “actual damages” to permit recovery for any&para;<br>injury established by competent evidence in the record—&para;<br>pecuniary or not—best effectuates the statute’s basic&para;<br>purpose. Although some privacy invasions no doubt result&para;<br>in economic loss, we have recognized time and again that&para;<br>the primary form of injuries is nonpecuniary, and includes&para;<br>mental distress and personal humiliation. See Time, Inc.&para;<br>v. Hill, 385 U. S. 374, 385, n. 9 (1967) (“In the ‘right of&para;<br>privacy’ cases the primary damage is the mental distress”); see also Gertz, 418 U. S., at 350 (“[A]ctual injury”&para;<br>in defamatory falsehood cases “is not limited to out-ofpocket loss. Indeed, the more customary types of actual&para;<br>harm inflicted by defamatory falsehood include impairment of reputation and standing in the community, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering”).&para;<br>Accord, 2 Dobbs §7.1.(1), at 259 (2d ed. 1993) (privacy is a&para;<br>dignitary interest, and “in a great many of the cases” in&para;<br>which the interest is invaded “the only harm is the affront&para;<br>to the plaintiff ’s dignity as a human being, the damage to&para;<br>his self-image, and the resulting mental distress”). That&para;<br>accords with common sense.&para;<br>In interpreting the civil-remedies provision, we must not&para;<br>forget Congress enacted the Privacy Act to protect privacy. The majority’s reading of “actual damages” renders&para;<br>the remedial provision impotent in the face of concededly&para;<br>unlawful agency action whenever the injury is solely&para;<br>nonpecuniary. That result is patently at odds with Congress’ stated purpose. The majority, however, does not&para;<br>grapple with the ramifications of its opinion. It acknowledges the suggestion that its holding leads to absurd&para;<br>results as it allows individuals suffering relatively minor&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>FAA v. COOPER&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>pecuniary losses to recover $1,000 while others suffering&para;<br>severe mental anguish to recover nothing. But it concludes that “there is nothing absurd about a scheme that&para;<br>limits the Government’s Privacy Act liability to harm that&para;<br>can be substantiated by proof of tangible economic loss.”&para;<br>Ante, at 18. Perhaps; it is certainly within Congress’&para;<br>prerogative to enact the statute the majority envisions,&para;<br>namely one that seeks to safeguard against invasions of&para;<br>privacy without remedying the primary harm that results&para;<br>from invasions of privacy. The problem for the majority is&para;<br>that one looks in vain for any indication in the text of the&para;<br>statute before us that Congress intended such a result.&para;<br>Nowhere in the Privacy Act does Congress so much as hint&para;<br>that it views a $5 hit to the pocketbook as more worthy of&para;<br>remedy than debilitating mental distress, and the majority’s contrary assumption discounts the gravity of emotional harm caused by an invasion of the personal integrity that privacy protects.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>After today, no matter how debilitating and substantial&para;<br>the resulting mental anguish, an individual harmed by&para;<br>a federal agency’s intentional or willful violation of the&para;<br>Privacy Act will be left without a remedy unless he or she&para;<br>is able to prove pecuniary harm. That is not the result&para;<br>Congress intended when it enacted an Act with the express purpose of safeguarding individual privacy against&para;<br>Government invasion. And it is not a result remotely&para;<br>suggested by anything in the text, structure, or history of&para;<br>the Act. For those reasons, I respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
