Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979), we held&para;<br>that a state prisoner is entitled to habeas corpus relief if a&para;<br>federal judge finds that “upon the record evidence adduced&para;<br>at the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof&para;<br>of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id., at 324. A Nevada&para;<br>jury convicted respondent of rape; the evidence presented&para;<br>included DNA evidence matching respondent’s DNA pro&para;<br>file. Nevertheless, relying upon a report prepared by a&para;<br>DNA expert over 11 years after the trial, the Federal&para;<br>District Court applied the Jackson standard and granted&para;<br>the writ. A divided Court of Appeals affirmed. Brown v.&para;<br>Farwell, 525 F. 3d 787 (CA9 2008). We granted certiorari&para;<br>to consider whether those courts misapplied Jackson.&para;<br>Because the trial record includes both the DNA evidence&para;<br>and other convincing evidence of guilt, we conclude that&para;<br>they clearly did.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Around 1 a.m. on January 29, 1994, 9-year-old Jane Doe&para;<br>was brutally raped in the bedroom of her trailer. Respon&para;<br>dent Troy Brown was convicted of the crime. During and&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDANIEL v. BROWN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>since his trial, respondent has steadfastly maintained his&para;<br>innocence.1 He was, however, admittedly intoxicated&para;<br>when the crime occurred, and after he awoke on the fol&para;<br>lowing morning he told a friend “ ‘he wished that he could&para;<br>remember what did go on or what went on.’ ” App. 309.&para;<br>Troy and his brother Travis resided near Jane Doe in&para;<br>the same trailer park. Their brother Trent and his wife&para;<br>Raquel lived in the park as well, in a trailer across the&para;<br>street from Jane Doe’s. Both Troy and Trent were ac&para;<br>quainted with Jane Doe’s family; Troy had visited Jane&para;<br>Doe’s trailer several times. Jane did not know Travis.&para;<br>The evening of the attack, Jane’s mother, Pam, took Jane&para;<br>to Raquel and Trent’s trailer to babysit while the three&para;<br>adults went out for about an hour. Raquel and Trent&para;<br>returned at about 7:30 p.m. and took Jane home at about&para;<br>9:30 p.m. Pam stayed out and ended up drinking and&para;<br>playing pool with Troy at a nearby bar called the Peacock&para;<br>Lounge. Troy knew that Jane and her 4-year-old sister&para;<br>were home alone because he answered the phone at&para;<br>the bar when Jane called for her mother earlier that&para;<br>evening.&para;<br>Troy consumed at least 10 shots of vodka followed by&para;<br>beer chasers, and was so drunk that he vomited on himself&para;<br>while he was walking home after leaving the Peacock at&para;<br>about 12:15 a.m. Jane called her mother to report the&para;<br>rape at approximately 1 a.m. Although it would have&para;<br>taken a sober man less than 15 minutes to walk home,&para;<br>Troy did not arrive at his trailer until about 1:30 a.m. He&para;<br>was wearing dark jeans, a cowboy hat, a black satin&para;<br>jacket, and boots. Two witnesses saw a man dressed in&para;<br>dark jeans, a cowboy hat, and a black satin jacket stum&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 He&para;<br>&para;<br>denied involvement when a police officer claimed (wrongly) that&para;<br>the police had found his fingerprints in Jane’s bedroom, and he even&para;<br>denied involvement when the sentencing judge told him that accep&para;<br>tance of responsibility would garner him leniency.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>bling in the road between the two trailers shortly after&para;<br>1 a.m.&para;<br>The bedroom where the rape occurred was dark, and&para;<br>Jane was unable to conclusively identify her assailant.&para;<br>When asked whom he reminded her of, she mentioned&para;<br>both Troy and his brother Trent. Several days after the&para;<br>rape, she identified a man she saw on television (Troy) as&para;<br>her assailant but then stated that the man who had sent&para;<br>flowers attacked her. It was Trent and Raquel who had&para;<br>sent her flowers, not Troy. She was unable to identify&para;<br>Troy as her assailant out of a photo lineup, and she could&para;<br>not identify her assailant at trial. The night of the rape,&para;<br>however, she said her attacker was wearing dark jeans, a&para;<br>black jacket with a zipper, boots, and a watch. She also&para;<br>vividly remembered that the man “stunk real, real bad” of&para;<br>“cologne, or some beer or puke or something.” Id., at 172–&para;<br>173.&para;<br>Some evidence besides Jane’s inconsistent identification&para;<br>did not inculpate Troy. Jane testified that she thought she&para;<br>had bitten her assailant, but Troy did not have any bite&para;<br>marks on his hands when examined by a police officer&para;<br>approximately four hours after the attack. Jane stated&para;<br>that her assailant’s jacket had a zipper (Troy’s did not)&para;<br>and that he wore a watch (Troy claimed he did not). Addi&para;<br>tionally, there was conflicting testimony as to when Troy&para;<br>left the Peacock and when Pam received Jane’s call report&para;<br>ing the rape. The witnesses who saw a man stumbling&para;<br>between the two trailers reported a bright green logo on&para;<br>the back of the jacket, but Troy’s jacket had a yellow and&para;<br>orange logo. Finally, because Jane thought she had left a&para;<br>night light on when she went to bed, the police suspected&para;<br>the assailant had turned off the light. The only usable&para;<br>fingerprint taken from the light did not match Troy’s and&para;<br>the police did not find Troy’s fingerprints in the trailer.&para;<br>Other physical evidence, however, pointed to Troy. The&para;<br>police recovered semen from Jane’s underwear and from&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDANIEL v. BROWN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>the rape kit. The State’s expert, Renee Romero, tested the&para;<br>former and determined that the DNA matched Troy’s and&para;<br>that the probability another person from the general&para;<br>population would share the same DNA (the “random&para;<br>match probability”) was only 1 in 3,000,000. Troy’s coun&para;<br>sel did not call his own DNA expert at trial, although he&para;<br>consulted with an expert in advance who found no prob&para;<br>lems with Romero’s test procedures. At some time before&para;<br>sentencing, Troy’s family had additional DNA testing&para;<br>done. That testing showed semen taken from the rape kit&para;<br>matched Troy’s DNA, with a random match probability of&para;<br>1 in 10,000.&para;<br>The jury found Troy guilty of sexual assault and sen&para;<br>tenced him to life with the possibility of parole after 10&para;<br>years.2 On direct appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court&para;<br>considered Troy’s claim that his conviction was not sup&para;<br>ported by sufficient evidence, analyzing “whether the jury,&para;<br>acting reasonably, could have been convinced of [Troy’s]&para;<br>guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Brown v. Nevada, 113&para;<br>Nev. 275, 285, 934 P. 2d 235, 241 (1997) (per curiam). The&para;<br>court rejected the claim, summarizing the evidence of guilt&para;<br>as follows:&para;<br>“Testimony indicated that Troy left the bar around&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Under&para;<br>&para;<br>Nevada law at the time of the trial, the jury, rather than the&para;<br>judge, imposed the sentence for a sexual assault crime if it found the&para;<br>assault resulted in substantial bodily harm. Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann.&para;<br>§200.366(3) (Michie 1992). For an assault resulting in substantial&para;<br>bodily harm, the jury had the option of sentencing Troy to life without&para;<br>the possibility of parole or to life with eligibility for parole after 10&para;<br>years. §200.366(2)(a). The jury elected the more lenient sentence. The&para;<br>judge sentenced Troy to life with the possibility of parole after 10 years&para;<br>on a second count of sexual assault, to run consecutively. The Nevada&para;<br>Supreme Court reversed Troy’s conviction for one count of child abuse&para;<br>on double jeopardy grounds, and ordered resentencing on the second&para;<br>sexual assault count. Brown v. Nevada, 113 Nev. 275, 934 P. 2d 235&para;<br>(1997) (per curiam). On resentencing, the judge imposed the same&para;<br>sentence as before.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

Troy had&para;<br>enough time to get from the bar to Jane Doe’s house&para;<br>and to assault Jane Doe before she made the tele&para;<br>phone call to her mother at approximately 1:00 a.m.&para;<br>While Jane Doe could not identify her assailant, her&para;<br>description of his clothing was similar to what Troy&para;<br>was wearing; she also said that her assailant smelled&para;<br>like beer or vomit and testimony indicated that Troy&para;<br>had been drinking beer and had vomited several times&para;<br>that night. Furthermore, testimony indicated that&para;<br>Troy got home at approximately 1:30 a.m., which gave&para;<br>him enough time to assault Jane Doe. Additionally,&para;<br>[witnesses] testified that they saw someone resem&para;<br>bling Troy in a black jacket and black hat stumbling&para;<br>in the road near Jane Doe’s house at 1:05 a.m. Troy&para;<br>also washed his pants and shirt when he got home,&para;<br>arguably to remove the blood evidence from his&para;<br>clothes. Finally, the DNA evidence indicated that se&para;<br>men collected from Jane Doe’s underwear matched&para;<br>Troy’s and that only 1 in 3,000,000 other people had&para;<br>matching DNA (the second DNA test indicated that 1&para;<br>in 10,000 people had matching DNA).” Ibid., 934&para;<br>P. 2d, at 241–242.&para;<br>Respondent also argued on appeal that the trial court&para;<br>erred in failing to conduct a pretrial hearing to determine&para;<br>whether the DNA evidence was reliable. The court found&para;<br>respondent had not raised this issue in the trial court and&para;<br>concluded there was no plain error in the trial court’s&para;<br>failure to conduct a hearing. Id., at 284, 934 P. 2d, at 241.&para;<br>In 2001, respondent sought state postconviction relief,&para;<br>claiming, inter alia, that his trial counsel was constitu&para;<br>tionally ineffective for failing to object to the admission of&para;<br>the DNA evidence. He argued that there were a number&para;<br>of foundational problems with the DNA evidence, and that&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDANIEL v. BROWN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>if trial counsel had objected, the evidence would have been&para;<br>excluded or at least its importance diminished. He noted&para;<br>that because trial counsel “totally failed to challenge the&para;<br>DNA evidence in the case,” counsel “failed to preserve&para;<br>valid issues for appeal.” App. 1101. The state postconvic&para;<br>tion court denied relief, id., at 1489–1499, and the Nevada&para;<br>Supreme Court affirmed, id., at 1500–1506.&para;<br>Respondent thereafter filed this federal habeas petition,&para;<br>claiming there was insufficient evidence to convict him on&para;<br>the sexual assault charges and that the Nevada Supreme&para;<br>Court’s rejection of his claim was both contrary to, and an&para;<br>unreasonable application of, Jackson. He did not bring a&para;<br>typical Jackson claim, however. Rather than argue that&para;<br>the totality of the evidence admitted against him at trial&para;<br>was constitutionally insufficient, he argued that some of&para;<br>the evidence should be excluded from the Jackson analy&para;<br>sis. In particular, he argued that Romero’s testimony&para;<br>related to the DNA evidence was inaccurate and unreli&para;<br>able in two primary respects: Romero mischaracterized&para;<br>the random match probability and misstated the probabil&para;<br>ity of a DNA match among his brothers. Absent that&para;<br>testimony, he contended, there was insufficient evidence&para;<br>to convict him.&para;<br>In support of his claim regarding the accuracy of Ro&para;<br>mero’s testimony, respondent submitted a report prepared&para;<br>by Laurence Mueller, a professor in ecology and evolution&para;<br>ary biology (Mueller Report). The District Court supple&para;<br>mented the record with the Mueller Report, even though it&para;<br>was not presented to any state court, because “the thesis&para;<br>of the report was argued during post-conviction.” Brown&para;<br>v. Farwell, No. 3:03–cv–00712–PMP–VPC, 2006 WL&para;<br>6181129, *5, n. 2 (Nev., Dec. 14, 2006).&para;<br>Relying upon the Mueller Report, the District Court set&para;<br>aside the “unreliable DNA testimony” and held that with&para;<br>out the DNA evidence “a reasonable doubt would exist in&para;<br>the mind of any rational trier of fact.” Id., at *7. The&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>court granted respondent habeas relief on his Jackson&para;<br>claim.3&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit affirmed. 525 F. 3d 787. The court&para;<br>held the Nevada Supreme Court had unreasonably applied&para;<br>Jackson. 525 F. 3d, at 798; see 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1).&para;<br>The Court of Appeals first reasoned “the admission of&para;<br>Romero’s unreliable and misleading testimony violated&para;<br>Troy’s due process rights,” so the District Court was cor&para;<br>rect to exclude it. 525 F. 3d, at 797. It then “weighed the&para;<br>sufficiency of the remaining evidence,” including the Dis&para;<br>trict Court’s “catalogu[e] [of] the numerous inconsistencies&para;<br>that would raise a reasonable doubt as to Troy’s guilt in&para;<br>the mind of any rational juror.” Ibid. In light of the&para;<br>“stark” conflicts in the evidence and the State’s concession&para;<br>that there was insufficient evidence absent the DNA&para;<br>evidence, the court held it was objectively unreasonable&para;<br>for the Nevada Supreme Court to reject respondent’s&para;<br>insufficiency-of-the-evidence claim. Id., at 798.&para;<br>We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), to consider&para;<br>two questions: the proper standard of review for a Jackson&para;<br>claim on federal habeas, and whether such a claim may&para;<br>rely upon evidence outside the trial record that goes to the&para;<br>reliability of trial evidence.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Respondent’s claim has now crystallized into a claim&para;<br>about the import of two specific inaccuracies in the testi&para;<br>mony related to the DNA evidence, as indicated by the&para;<br>Mueller Report. The Mueller Report does not challenge&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The District Court also granted habeas relief on respondent’s claim&para;<br>that he was denied effective assistance of counsel with respect to his&para;<br>attorney’s handling of the DNA evidence and failure to adequately&para;<br>investigate the victim’s stepfather as an alternative suspect. Brown v.&para;<br>Farwell, No. 3:03–cv–00712–PMP–VPC, 2006 WL 6181129, *9–*10&para;<br>(Nev., Dec. 14, 2006). The Court of Appeals did not consider those&para;<br>claims on appeal and they are not now before us.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDANIEL v. BROWN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Romero’s qualifications as an expert or the validity of any&para;<br>of the tests that she performed. Mueller instead contends&para;<br>that Romero committed the so-called “prosecutor’s fallacy”&para;<br>and that she underestimated the probability of a DNA&para;<br>match between respondent and one of his brothers.&para;<br>The prosecutor’s fallacy is the assumption that the&para;<br>random match probability is the same as the probability&para;<br>that the defendant was not the source of the DNA sample.&para;<br>See Nat. Research Council, Comm. on DNA Forensic&para;<br>Science, The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence 133&para;<br>(1996) (“Let P equal the probability of a match, given the&para;<br>evidence genotype. The fallacy is to say that P is also the&para;<br>probability that the DNA at the crime scene came from&para;<br>someone other than the defendant”). In other words, if a&para;<br>juror is told the probability a member of the general popu&para;<br>lation would share the same DNA is 1 in 10,000 (random&para;<br>match probability), and he takes that to mean there is&para;<br>only a 1 in 10,000 chance that someone other than the&para;<br>defendant is the source of the DNA found at the crime&para;<br>scene (source probability), then he has succumbed to the&para;<br>prosecutor’s fallacy. It is further error to equate source&para;<br>probability with probability of guilt, unless there is no&para;<br>explanation other than guilt for a person to be the source&para;<br>of crime-scene DNA. This faulty reasoning may result in&para;<br>an erroneous statement that, based on a random match&para;<br>probability of 1 in 10,000, there is a .01% chance the de&para;<br>fendant is innocent or a 99.99% chance the defendant is&para;<br>guilty.&para;<br>The Mueller Report does not dispute Romero’s opinion&para;<br>that only 1 in 3,000,000 people would have the same DNA&para;<br>profile as the rapist. Mueller correctly points out, how&para;<br>ever, that some of Romero’s testimony—as well as the&para;<br>prosecutor’s argument—suggested that the evidence also&para;<br>established that there was only a .000033% chance that&para;<br>respondent was innocent. The State concedes as much.&para;<br>Brief for Petitioners 54. For example, the prosecutor&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>argued at closing the jury could be “99.999967 percent&para;<br>sure” in this case. App. 730. And when the prosecutor&para;<br>asked Romero, in a classic example of erroneously equat&para;<br>ing source probability with random match probability,&para;<br>whether “it [would] be fair to say . . . that the chances that&para;<br>the DNA found in the panties—the semen in the panties—&para;<br>and the blood sample, the likelihood that it is not Troy&para;<br>Brown would be .000033,” id., at 460, Romero ultimately&para;<br>agreed that it was “not inaccurate” to state it that way,&para;<br>id., at 461–462.&para;<br>Looking at Romero’s testimony as a whole, though, she&para;<br>also indicated that she was merely accepting the mathe&para;<br>matical equivalence between 1 in 3,000,000 and the per&para;<br>centage figure. At the end of the colloquy about percent&para;<br>ages, she answered affirmatively the court’s question&para;<br>whether the percentage was “the same math just ex&para;<br>pressed differently.” Id., at 462. She pointed out that the&para;<br>probability a brother would match was greater than the&para;<br>random match probability, which also indicated to the jury&para;<br>that the random match probability is not the same as the&para;<br>likelihood that someone other than Troy was the source of&para;<br>the DNA.&para;<br>The Mueller Report identifies a second error in Romero’s&para;<br>testimony: her estimate of the probability that one or more&para;<br>of Troy’s brothers’ DNA would match. Romero testified&para;<br>there was a 1 in 6,500 (or .02%) probability that one&para;<br>brother would share the same DNA with another. Id., at&para;<br>469, 472. When asked whether “that change[s] at all with&para;<br>two brothers,” she answered no. Id., at 472. According to&para;<br>Mueller, Romero’s analysis was misleading in two re&para;<br>spects. First, she used an assumption regarding the par&para;<br>ents under which siblings have the lowest chance of&para;<br>matching that is biologically possible, but even under this&para;<br>stingy assumption she reported the chance of two brothers&para;<br>matching (1 in 6,500) as much lower than it is (1 in 1,024&para;<br>under her assumption). Second, using the assumptions&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDANIEL v. BROWN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Mueller finds more appropriate, the probability of a single&para;<br>sibling matching respondent is 1 in 263, the probability&para;<br>that among two brothers one or more would match is 1 in&para;<br>132, and among four brothers it is 1 in 66. Id., at 1583.&para;<br>In sum, the two inaccuracies upon which this case turns&para;<br>are testimony equating random match probability with&para;<br>source probability, and an underestimate of the likelihood&para;<br>that one of Troy’s brothers would also match the DNA left&para;<br>at the scene.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Although we granted certiorari to review respondent’s&para;<br>Jackson claim, the parties now agree that the Court of&para;<br>Appeals’ resolution of his claim under Jackson was in&para;<br>error. See Brief for Respondent 2–3; Reply Brief for Peti&para;<br>tioners 1. Indeed, respondent argues the Court of Appeals&para;<br>did not decide his case under Jackson at all, but instead&para;<br>resolved the question whether admission of Romero’s&para;<br>inaccurate testimony rendered his trial fundamentally&para;<br>unfair and then applied Jackson to determine whether&para;<br>that error was harmless.&para;<br>Although both petitioners and respondent are now&para;<br>aligned on the same side of the questions presented for our&para;<br>review, the case is not moot because “the parties continue&para;<br>to seek different relief” from this Court. Pacific Bell Tele&para;<br>phone Co. v. linkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U. S. ___,&para;<br>___ (2009) (slip op., at 6). Respondent primarily argues&para;<br>that we affirm on his proposed alternative ground or&para;<br>remand to the Ninth Circuit for analysis of his due process&para;<br>claim under the standard for harmless error of Brecht v.&para;<br>Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993). The State, on the&para;<br>other hand, asks us to reverse. Respondent and one&para;<br>amicus have also suggested that we dismiss the case as&para;<br>improvidently granted, Brief for National Association of&para;<br>Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 27–28, but&para;<br>we think prudential concerns favor our review of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>of Appeals’ application of Jackson. Cf. Pacific Bell, supra,&para;<br>at ___ (slip op., at 7).&para;<br>Respondent no longer argues it was proper for the Dis&para;<br>trict Court to admit the Mueller Report for the purpose of&para;<br>evaluating his Jackson claim, Brief for Respondent 35,&para;<br>and concedes the “purpose of a Jackson analysis is to&para;<br>determine whether the jury acted in a rational manner in&para;<br>returning a guilty verdict based on the evidence before it,&para;<br>not whether improper evidence violated due process,” id.,&para;<br>at 2. There has been no suggestion that the evidence&para;<br>adduced at trial was insufficient to convict unless some of&para;<br>it was excluded. Respondent’s concession thus disposes of&para;<br>his Jackson claim. The concession is also clearly correct.&para;<br>An “appellate court’s reversal for insufficiency of the evi&para;<br>dence is in effect a determination that the government’s&para;<br>case against the defendant was so lacking that the trial&para;<br>court should have entered a judgment of acquittal.” Lock&para;<br>hart v. Nelson, 488 U. S. 33, 39 (1988). Because reversal&para;<br>for insufficiency of the evidence is equivalent to a judg&para;<br>ment of acquittal, such a reversal bars a retrial. See&para;<br>Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 18 (1978). To “make&para;<br>the analogy complete” between a reversal for insufficiency&para;<br>of the evidence and the trial court’s granting a judgment of&para;<br>acquittal, Lockhart, 488 U. S., at 42, “a reviewing court&para;<br>must consider all of the evidence admitted by the trial&para;<br>court,” regardless whether that evidence was admitted&para;<br>erroneously, id., at 41.&para;<br>Respondent therefore correctly concedes that a review&para;<br>ing court must consider all of the evidence admitted at&para;<br>trial when considering a Jackson claim. Even if we set&para;<br>that concession aside, however, and assume that the Court&para;<br>of Appeals could have considered the Mueller Report in&para;<br>the context of a Jackson claim, the court made an egre&para;<br>gious error in concluding the Nevada Supreme Court’s&para;<br>rejection of respondent’s insufficiency-of-the-evidence&para;<br>claim “involved an unreasonable application of . . . clearly&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDANIEL v. BROWN&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>established Federal law,” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1).4&para;<br>Even if the Court of Appeals could have considered it,&para;<br>the Mueller Report provided no warrant for entirely ex&para;<br>cluding the DNA evidence or Romero’s testimony from&para;<br>that court’s consideration. The Report did not contest that&para;<br>the DNA evidence matched Troy. That DNA evidence&para;<br>remains powerful inculpatory evidence even though the&para;<br>State concedes Romero overstated its probative value by&para;<br>failing to dispel the prosecutor’s fallacy. And Mueller’s&para;<br>claim that Romero used faulty assumptions and underes&para;<br>timated the probability of a DNA match between brothers&para;<br>indicates that two experts do not agree with one another,&para;<br>not that Romero’s estimates were unreliable.5&para;<br>Mueller’s opinion that “the chance that among four&para;<br>brothers one or more would match is 1 in 66,” App. 1583,&para;<br>is substantially different from Romero’s estimate of a 1 in&para;<br>6,500 chance that one brother would match. But even if&para;<br>Romero’s estimate is wrong, our confidence in the jury&para;<br>verdict is not undermined.

The Court of&para;<br>Appeals held the Nevada Supreme Court’s decision was “contrary to”&para;<br>Jackson because the Nevada court stated a standard that turns on a&para;<br>“reasonable” jury, not a “rational” one, and that assesses whether the&para;<br>jury could have been convinced of a defendant’s guilt, rather than&para;<br>whether it could have been convinced of each element of the crime.&para;<br>Brown v. Farwell, 525 F. 3d 787, 794–795 (CA9 2008). It is of little&para;<br>moment that the Nevada Supreme Court analyzed whether a “reason&para;<br>able” jury could be convinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, rather&para;<br>than asking whether a “rational” one could be convinced of each ele&para;<br>ment of guilt; a reasonable jury could hardly be convinced of guilt&para;<br>unless it found each element satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.&para;<br>5 The State has called our attention to cases in which courts have&para;<br>criticized opinions rendered by Professor Mueller in the past. See Brief&para;<br>for Petitioners 53–54. We need not pass on the relative credibility of&para;<br>the two experts because even assuming that Mueller’s estimate is&para;<br>correct, respondent’s claim fails.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 558 U.

Second, although Jane Doe men&para;<br>tioned Trent as her assailant, and Travis lived in a nearby&para;<br>trailer, the evidence indicates that both (unlike Troy) were&para;<br>sober and went to bed early on the night of the crime.&para;<br>Even under Mueller’s odds, a rational jury could consider&para;<br>the DNA evidence to be powerful evidence of guilt.&para;<br>Furthermore, the Court of Appeals’ discussion of the&para;<br>non-DNA evidence departed from the deferential review&para;<br>that Jackson and §2254(d)(1) demand. A federal habeas&para;<br>court can only set aside a state-court decision as “an un&para;<br>reasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal&para;<br>law,” §2254(d)(1), if the state court’s application of that&para;<br>law is “objectively unreasonable,” Williams v. Taylor, 529&para;<br>U. S. 362, 409 (2000). And Jackson requires a reviewing&para;<br>court to review the evidence “in the light most favorable to&para;<br>the prosecution.” 443 U. S., at 319. Expressed more fully,&para;<br>this means a reviewing court “faced with a record of his&para;<br>torical facts that supports conflicting inferences must&para;<br>presume—even if it does not affirmatively appear in the&para;<br>record—that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in&para;<br>favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolu&para;<br>tion.” Id., at 326; see also Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298,&para;<br>330 (1995) (“The Jackson standard . . . looks to whether&para;<br>there is sufficient evidence which, if credited, could sup&para;<br>port the conviction”). The Court of Appeals acknowledged&para;<br>that it must review the evidence in the light most favor&para;<br>able to the prosecution, but the court’s recitation of incon&para;<br>sistencies in the testimony shows it failed to do that.&para;<br>For example, the court highlights conflicting testimony&para;<br>regarding when Troy left the Peacock. 525 F. 3d, at 797.&para;<br>It is true that if a juror were to accept the testimony of one&para;<br>bartender that Troy left the bar at 1:30 a.m., then Troy&para;<br>would have left the bar after the attack occurred.

It&para;<br>is undisputed that Troy washed his clothes immediately&para;<br>upon returning home. The court notes this is “plausibly&para;<br>consistent with him being the assailant” but also that he&para;<br>provided an alternative reason for washing his clothes.&para;<br>Ibid. Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecu&para;<br>tion, the evidence supports an inference that Troy washed&para;<br>the clothes immediately to clean blood from them.&para;<br>To be sure, the court’s Jackson analysis relied substan&para;<br>tially upon a concession made by the State in state post&para;<br>conviction proceedings that “absent the DNA findings,&para;<br>there was insufficient evidence to convict [Troy] of the&para;<br>crime.” App. 1180. But that concession posited a situation&para;<br>in which there was no DNA evidence at all,6 not a situa&para;<br>tion in which some pieces of testimony regarding the DNA&para;<br>evidence were called into question. In sum, the Court of&para;<br>Appeals’ analysis failed to preserve “the factfinder’s role as&para;<br>weigher of the evidence” by reviewing “all of the evidence&para;<br>. . . in the light most favorable to the prosecution,” Jack&para;<br>son, supra, at 319, and it further erred in finding that the&para;<br>Nevada Supreme Court’s resolution of the Jackson claim&para;<br>was objectively unreasonable.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>Resolution of the Jackson claim does not end our consid&para;<br>eration of this case because respondent asks us to affirm&para;<br>on an alternative ground.

Respondent argues that the admission of&para;<br>the inaccurate DNA testimony violated Brathwaite be&para;<br>cause the testimony was “identification testimony,” 432&para;<br>U.

Nelson, 488 U. S.&para;<br>33, 41 (1988)); see Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307&para;<br>(1979). I write separately because I disagree with the&para;<br>Court’s decision to complicate its analysis with an exten&para;<br>sive discussion of the Mueller Report. See ante, at 7–13.&para;<br>Defense counsel commissioned that report 11 years after&para;<br>respondent’s trial. See ante, at 1. Accordingly, the re&para;<br>port’s attacks on the State’s DNA testimony were not part&para;<br>of the trial evidence and have no place in the Jackson&para;<br>inquiry. See Jackson, supra, at 318; Lockhart, supra, at&para;<br>40–42. That is all we need or should say about the report&para;<br>in deciding this case.&para;<br>The Court’s opinion demonstrates as much. The Court’s&para;<br>lengthy discussion of the Mueller Report, see ante, at 7–&para;<br>10, is merely a predicate to asserting that “even if” the&para;<br>Court of Appeals could have considered the report in its&para;<br>Jackson analysis, the report “provided no warrant for&para;<br>entirely excluding the DNA evidence or Romero’s testi&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MCDANIEL v.

Based on these observations, the&para;<br>Court concludes that the Mueller Report did not under&para;<br>mine the State’s DNA tests as “powerful inculpatory evi&para;<br>dence.” Ibid. That is true, but even if the report had&para;<br>completely undermined the DNA evidence—which the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit may have mistakenly believed it did, see&para;<br>Brown v. Farwell, 525 F. 3d 787, 795–796 (2008)—the&para;<br>panel still would have erred in considering the report to&para;<br>resolve respondent’s Jackson claim. The reason, as the&para;<br>Court reaffirms, is that Jackson claims must be decided&para;<br>solely on the evidence adduced at trial. See ante, at 11.&para;<br>Accordingly, the Court need not correct any erroneous&para;<br>impressions the Ninth Circuit may have had concerning&para;<br>the report’s impact on the State’s DNA evidence to resolve&para;<br>respondent’s Jackson claim.* Because that is the only&para;<br>claim properly before us, I do not join the Court’s dicta&para;<br>about how the Mueller Report’s findings could affect a&para;<br>constitutional analysis to which we have long held such&para;<br>post-trial evidence does not apply. See Jackson, supra, at&para;<br>318.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Correcting the Ninth Circuit’s apparent misconception of the effects&para;<br>of the Mueller Report is the only plausible reason for the Court’s&para;<br>decision to explain that the report would not have undermined the&para;<br>State’s DNA results “even if” the Court of Appeals could have consid&para;<br>ered it in resolving respondent’s Jackson claim. Ante, at 11–12. That&para;<br>discussion cannot properly be read to suggest either that there are&para;<br>circumstances in which post-trial evidence would “warrant” excluding&para;<br>DNA trial evidence from a Jackson analysis, ante, at 12, or that courts&para;<br>applying Jackson may consider post-trial evidence for any other pur&para;<br>pose.
