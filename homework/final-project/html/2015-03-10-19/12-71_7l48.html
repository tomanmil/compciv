Argued March 18, 2013—Decided June 17, 2013&para;<br>The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) requires States to&para;<br>“accept and use” a uniform federal form to register voters for federal&para;<br>elections. 42 U. S. C. §1973gg–4(a)(1). That “Federal Form,” developed by the federal Election Assistance Commission (EAC), requires&para;<br>only that an applicant aver, under penalty of perjury, that he is a citizen. Arizona law, however, requires voter-registration officials to&para;<br>“reject” any application for registration, including a Federal Form,&para;<br>that is not accompanied by documentary evidence of citizenship. Respondents, a group of individual Arizona residents and a group of&para;<br>nonprofit organizations, sought to enjoin that Arizona law. Ultimately, the District Court granted Arizona summary judgment on respondents’ claim that the NVRA pre-empts Arizona’s requirement.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit affirmed in part but reversed as relevant here,&para;<br>holding that the state law’s documentary-proof-of-citizenship requirement is pre-empted by the NVRA.&para;<br>Held: Arizona’s evidence-of-citizenship requirement, as applied to Federal Form applicants, is pre-empted by the NVRA’s mandate that&para;<br>States “accept and use” the Federal Form. Pp. 4–18.&para;<br>(a) The Elections Clause imposes on States the duty to prescribe&para;<br>the time, place, and manner of electing Representatives and Senators, but it confers on Congress the power to alter those regulations&para;<br>or supplant them altogether.&para;<br>See U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v.&para;<br>Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 804–805. This Court has said that the&para;<br>terms “Times, Places, and Manner” “embrace authority to provide a&para;<br>complete code for congressional elections,” including regulations relating to “registration.” Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, 366. Pp. 4–6.&para;<br>(b) Because “accept and use” are words “that can have more than&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>one meaning,” they “are given content . . . by their surroundings.”&para;<br>Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 466.&para;<br>Reading “accept” merely to denote willing receipt seems out of place&para;<br>in the context of an official mandate to accept and use something for&para;<br>a given purpose. The implication of such a mandate is that its object&para;<br>is to be accepted as sufficient for the requirement it is meant to satisfy. Arizona’s reading is also difficult to reconcile with neighboring&para;<br>NVRA provisions, such as §1973gg–6(a)(1)(B) and §1973gg–4(a)(2).&para;<br>Arizona’s appeal to the presumption against pre-emption invoked&para;<br>in this Court’s Supremacy Clause cases is inapposite. The power the&para;<br>Elections Clause confers is none other than the power to pre-empt.&para;<br>Because Congress, when it acts under this Clause, is always on notice&para;<br>that its legislation will displace some element of a pre-existing legal&para;<br>regime erected by the States, the reasonable assumption is that the&para;<br>text of Elections Clause legislation accurately communicates the&para;<br>scope of Congress’s pre-emptive intent.&para;<br>Nonetheless, while the NVRA forbids States to demand that an applicant submit additional information beyond that required by the&para;<br>Federal Form, it does not preclude States from “deny[ing] registration based on information in their possession establishing the applicant’s ineligibility.” Pp. 6–13.&para;<br>(c) Arizona is correct that the Elections Clause empowers Congress&para;<br>to regulate how federal elections are held, but not who may vote in&para;<br>them. The latter is the province of the States. See U. S. Const., Art.&para;<br>I, §2, cl. 1; Amdt. 17. It would raise serious constitutional doubts if a&para;<br>federal statute precluded a State from obtaining the information necessary to enforce its voter qualifications. The NVRA can be read to&para;<br>avoid such a conflict, however. Section 1973gg–7(b)(1) permits the&para;<br>EAC to include on the Federal Form information “necessary to enable&para;<br>the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the&para;<br>applicant.” That validly conferred discretionary executive authority&para;<br>is properly exercised (as the Government has proposed) to require the&para;<br>inclusion of Arizona’s concrete-evidence requirement if such evidence&para;<br>is necessary to enable Arizona to enforce its citizenship qualification.&para;<br>The NVRA permits a State to request the EAC to include statespecific instructions on the Federal Form, see 42 U. S. C. §1973gg–&para;<br>7(a)(2), and a State may challenge the EAC’s rejection of that request&para;<br>(or failure to act on it) in a suit under the Administrative Procedure&para;<br>Act. That alternative means of enforcing its constitutional power to&para;<br>determine voting qualifications remains open to Arizona here.&para;<br>Should the EAC reject or decline to act on a renewed request, Arizona&para;<br>would have the opportunity to establish in a reviewing court that a&para;<br>mere oath will not suffice to effectuate its citizenship requirement&para;<br>and that the EAC is therefore under a nondiscretionary duty to in-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

The contents of that form (colloquially&para;<br>known as the Federal Form) are prescribed by a federal&para;<br>agency, the Election Assistance Commission. The Federal&para;<br>Form developed by the EAC does not require documentary&para;<br>evidence of citizenship; rather, it requires only that an&para;<br>applicant aver, under penalty of perjury, that he is a&para;<br>citizen. Arizona law requires voter-registration officials to&para;<br>“reject” any application for registration, including a Federal Form, that is not accompanied by concrete evidence of&para;<br>citizenship. The question is whether Arizona’s evidenceof-citizenship requirement, as applied to Federal Form&para;<br>applicants, is pre-empted by the Act’s mandate that States&para;<br>“accept and use” the Federal Form.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Over the past two decades, Congress has erected a&para;<br>complex superstructure of federal regulation atop state&para;<br>voter-registration systems.

Fordice, 520 U. S. 273, 275 (1997). The Act&para;<br>requires each State to permit prospective voters to “register to vote in elections for Federal office” by any of three&para;<br>methods: simultaneously with a driver’s license application, in person, or by mail. §1973gg–2(a).&para;<br>This case concerns registration by mail.&para;<br>Section&para;<br>1973gg–2(a)(2) of the Act requires a State to establish&para;<br>procedures for registering to vote in federal elections “by&para;<br>mail application pursuant to section 1973gg–4 of this&para;<br>title.” Section 1973gg–4, in turn, requires States to “accept and use” a standard federal registration form.&para;<br>§1973gg–4(a)(1). The Election Assistance Commission is&para;<br>invested with rulemaking authority to prescribe the contents of that Federal Form. §1973gg–7(a)(1); see §15329.1&para;<br>The EAC is explicitly instructed, however, to develop the&para;<br>Federal Form “in consultation with the chief election&para;<br>officers of the States.” §1973gg–7(a)(2). The Federal Form&para;<br>thus contains a number of state-specific instructions,&para;<br>which tell residents of each State what additional information they must provide and where they must submit&para;<br>the form. See National Mail Voter Registration Form, pp.&para;<br>3–20, online at http://www.eac.gov (all Internet materials&para;<br>as visited June 11, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court’s&para;<br>case file); 11 CFR §9428.3 (2012). Each state-specific&para;<br>instruction must be approved by the EAC before it is&para;<br>included on the Federal Form.&para;<br>To be eligible to vote under Arizona law, a person must&para;<br>be a citizen of the United States. Ariz. Const., Art. VII, §2;&para;<br>Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §16–101(A) (West 2006). This case&para;<br>concerns Arizona’s efforts to enforce that qualification.

S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>2004, Arizona voters adopted Proposition 200, a ballot&para;<br>initiative designed in part “to combat voter fraud by requiring voters to present proof of citizenship when they&para;<br>register to vote and to present identification when they&para;<br>vote on election day.” Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1, 2&para;<br>(2006) (per curiam).2 Proposition 200 amended the State’s&para;<br>election code to require county recorders to “reject any&para;<br>application for registration that is not accompanied by&para;<br>satisfactory evidence of United States citizenship.” Ariz.&para;<br>Rev. Stat. Ann. §16–166(F) (West Supp. 2012). The proofof-citizenship requirement is satisfied by (1) a photocopy of&para;<br>the applicant’s passport or birth certificate, (2) a driver’s&para;<br>license number, if the license states that the issuing authority verified the holder’s U. S. citizenship, (3) evidence&para;<br>of naturalization, (4) tribal identification, or (5) “[o]ther&para;<br>documents or methods of proof . . . established pursuant to&para;<br>the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.” Ibid.&para;<br>The EAC did not grant Arizona’s request to include this&para;<br>new requirement among the state-specific instructions&para;<br>for Arizona on the Federal Form. App. 225. Consequently, the Federal Form includes a statutorily required&para;<br>attestation, subscribed to under penalty of perjury, that&para;<br>an Arizona applicant meets the State’s voting requirements (including the citizenship requirement), see&para;<br>§1973gg–7(b)(2), but does not require concrete evidence of&para;<br>citizenship.&para;<br>The two groups of plaintiffs represented here—a group&para;<br>of individual Arizona residents (dubbed the Gonzalez&para;<br>plaintiffs, after lead plaintiff Jesus Gonzalez) and a group&para;<br>of nonprofit organizations led by the Inter Tribal Council&para;<br>of Arizona (ITCA)—filed separate suits seeking to enjoin&para;<br>the voting provisions of Proposition 200.

A two-judge motions panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit then enjoined Proposition 200&para;<br>pending appeal. Purcell, 549 U. S., at 3. We vacated that&para;<br>order and allowed the impending 2006 election to proceed&para;<br>with the new rules in place. Id., at 5–6. On remand, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s initial&para;<br>denial of a preliminary injunction as to respondents’ claim&para;<br>that the NVRA pre-empts Proposition 200’s registration&para;<br>rules. Gonzales v. Arizona, 485 F. 3d 1041, 1050–1051&para;<br>(2007). The District Court then granted Arizona’s motion&para;<br>for summary judgment as to that claim. App. to Pet. for&para;<br>Cert. 1e, 3e.

I, §4, cl. 1, provides:&para;<br>“The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections&para;<br>for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed&para;<br>in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the&para;<br>Congress may at any time by Law make or alter&para;<br>such Regulations, except as to the places of chusing&para;<br>Senators.”&para;<br>The Clause empowers Congress to pre-empt state regulations governing the “Times, Places and Manner” of holding&para;<br>congressional elections. The question here is whether the&para;<br>federal statutory requirement that States “accept and use”&para;<br>the Federal Form pre-empts Arizona’s state-law require-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ment that officials “reject” the application of a prospective&para;<br>voter who submits a completed Federal Form unaccompanied by documentary evidence of citizenship.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Elections Clause has two functions. Upon the&para;<br>States it imposes the duty (“shall be prescribed”) to prescribe the time, place, and manner of electing Representatives and Senators; upon Congress it confers the power to&para;<br>alter those regulations or supplant them altogether. See&para;<br>U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 804–&para;<br>805 (1995); id., at 862 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). This&para;<br>grant of congressional power was the Framers’ insurance&para;<br>against the possibility that a State would refuse to provide&para;<br>for the election of representatives to the Federal Congress.&para;<br>“[E]very government ought to contain in itself the means&para;<br>of its own preservation,” and “an exclusive power of regulating elections for the national government, in the hands&para;<br>of the State legislatures, would leave the existence of the&para;<br>Union entirely at their mercy. They could at any moment&para;<br>annihilate it by neglecting to provide for the choice of&para;<br>persons to administer its affairs.” The Federalist No. 59,&para;<br>pp. 362–363 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (emphasis deleted). That prospect seems fanciful today, but the&para;<br>widespread, vociferous opposition to the proposed Constitution made it a very real concern in the founding era.&para;<br>The Clause’s substantive scope is broad. “Times, Places,&para;<br>and Manner,” we have written, are “comprehensive&para;<br>words,” which “embrace authority to provide a complete&para;<br>code for congressional elections,” including, as relevant&para;<br>here and as petitioners do not contest, regulations relating to “registration.” Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, 366&para;<br>(1932); see also Roudebush v. Hartke, 405 U. S. 15, 24–25&para;<br>(1972) (recounts); United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299,&para;<br>320 (1941) (primaries). In practice, the Clause functions&para;<br>as “a default provision; it invests the States with responsi-&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>bility for the mechanics of congressional elections, but only&para;<br>so far as Congress declines to pre-empt state legislative&para;<br>choices.” Foster v. Love, 522 U. S. 67, 69 (1997) (citation&para;<br>omitted). The power of Congress over the “Times, Places&para;<br>and Manner” of congressional elections “is paramount, and&para;<br>may be exercised at any time, and to any extent which it&para;<br>deems expedient; and so far as it is exercised, and no&para;<br>farther, the regulations effected supersede those of the&para;<br>State which are inconsistent therewith.” Ex parte Siebold,&para;<br>100 U. S. 371, 392 (1880).&para;<br>B&para;<br>The straightforward textual question here is whether&para;<br>Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §16–166(F), which requires state&para;<br>officials to “reject” a Federal Form unaccompanied by&para;<br>documentary evidence of citizenship, conflicts with the&para;<br>NVRA’s mandate that Arizona “accept and use” the Federal Form. If so, the state law, “so far as the conflict extends, ceases to be operative.” Siebold, supra, at 384. In&para;<br>Arizona’s view, these seemingly incompatible obligations&para;<br>can be read to operate harmoniously: The NVRA, it contends, requires merely that a State receive the Federal&para;<br>Form willingly and use that form as one element in its&para;<br>(perhaps lengthy) transaction with a prospective voter.&para;<br>Taken in isolation, the mandate that a State “accept and&para;<br>use” the Federal Form is fairly susceptible of two interpretations. It might mean that a State must accept the&para;<br>Federal Form as a complete and sufficient registration application; or it might mean that the State is merely required&para;<br>to receive the form willingly and use it somehow in its&para;<br>voter registration process. Both readings—“receive willingly” and “accept as sufficient”—are compatible with the&para;<br>plain meaning of the word “accept.” See 1 Oxford English&para;<br>Dictionary 70 (2d ed. 1989) (“To take or receive (a thing&para;<br>offered) willingly”; “To receive as sufficient or adequate”);&para;<br>Webster’s New International Dictionary 14 (2d ed. 1954)&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(“To receive (a thing offered to or thrust upon one) with a&para;<br>consenting mind”; “To receive with favor; to approve”).&para;<br>And we take it as self-evident that the “elastic” verb “use,”&para;<br>read in isolation, is broad enough to encompass Arizona’s&para;<br>preferred construction. Smith v. United States, 508 U. S.&para;<br>223, 241 (1993) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). In common parlance, one might say that a restaurant accepts and uses&para;<br>credit cards even though it requires customers to show&para;<br>matching identification when making a purchase. See&para;<br>also Brief for State Petitioners 40 (“An airline may advertise that it ‘accepts and uses’ e-tickets . . . , yet may still&para;<br>require photo identification before one could board the&para;<br>airplane”).&para;<br>“Words that can have more than one meaning are given&para;<br>content, however, by their surroundings.” Whitman v.&para;<br>American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 466 (2001);&para;<br>see also Smith, supra, at 241 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). And&para;<br>reading “accept” merely to denote willing receipt seems&para;<br>out of place in the context of an official mandate to accept&para;<br>and use something for a given purpose. The implication of&para;<br>such a mandate is that its object is to be accepted as sufficient for the requirement it is meant to satisfy. For example, a government diktat that “civil servants shall accept&para;<br>government IOUs for payment of salaries” does not invite&para;<br>the response, “sure, we’ll accept IOUs—if you pay us a ten&para;<br>percent down payment in cash.” Many federal statutes&para;<br>contain similarly phrased commands, and they contemplate more than mere willing receipt. See, e.g., 5 U. S. C.&para;<br>§8332(b), (m)(3) (“The Office [of Personnel Management]&para;<br>shall accept the certification of ” various officials concerning creditable service toward civilian-employee retirement); 12 U. S. C. A. §2605(l)(2) (Supp. 2013) (“A servicer&para;<br>of a federally related mortgage shall accept any reasonable&para;<br>form of written confirmation from a borrower of existing&para;<br>insurance coverage”); 16 U. S. C. §1536(p) (Endangered&para;<br>Species Committee “shall accept the determinations of the&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>President” with respect to whether a major disaster warrants an exception to the Endangered Species Act’s requirements); §4026(b)(2), 118 Stat. 3725, note following 22&para;<br>U.

S. C. §1395w–&para;<br>21(e)(6)(A) (“[A] Medicare+Choice organization . . . shall&para;<br>accept elections or changes to elections during” specified&para;<br>periods).3&para;<br>Arizona’s reading is also difficult to reconcile with&para;<br>neighboring provisions of the NVRA. Section 1973gg–&para;<br>6(a)(1)(B) provides that a State shall “ensure that any&para;<br>eligible applicant is registered to vote in an election . . . if&para;<br>the valid voter registration form of the applicant is postmarked” not later than a specified number of days before&para;<br>the election. (Emphasis added.) Yet Arizona reads the&para;<br>phrase “accept and use” in §1973gg–4(a)(1) as permitting&para;<br>it to reject a completed Federal Form if the applicant does&para;<br>not submit additional information required by state law.&para;<br>That reading can be squared with Arizona’s obligation&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent accepts that a State may not impose additional requirements that render the Federal Form entirely superfluous; it would&para;<br>require that the State “us[e] the form as a meaningful part of the&para;<br>registration process.” Post, at 7 (opinion of ALITO, J.). The dissent does&para;<br>not tell us precisely how large a role for the Federal Form suffices to&para;<br>make it “meaningful”: One step out of two? Three? Ten? There is no&para;<br>easy answer, for the dissent’s “meaningful part” standard is as indeterminate as it is atextual.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>under §1973gg–6(a)(1) only if a completed Federal Form is&para;<br>not a “valid voter registration form,” which seems unlikely.&para;<br>The statute empowers the EAC to create the Federal&para;<br>Form, §1973gg–7(a), requires the EAC to prescribe its&para;<br>contents within specified limits, §1973gg–7(b), and requires States to “accept and use” it, §1973gg–4(a)(1). It is&para;<br>improbable that the statute envisions a completed copy of&para;<br>the form it takes such pains to create as being anything&para;<br>less than “valid.”&para;<br>The Act also authorizes States, “[i]n addition to accepting and using the” Federal Form, to create their own,&para;<br>state-specific voter-registration forms, which can be used&para;<br>to register voters in both state and federal elections.&para;<br>§1973gg–4(a)(2) (emphasis added). These state-developed&para;<br>forms may require information the Federal Form does not.&para;<br>(For example, unlike the Federal Form, Arizona’s registration form includes Proposition 200’s proof-of-citizenship&para;<br>requirement. See Arizona Voter Registration Form, p. 1,&para;<br>online at http://www.azsos.gov.) This permission works in&para;<br>tandem with the requirement that States “accept and use”&para;<br>the Federal Form. States retain the flexibility to design&para;<br>and use their own registration forms, but the Federal&para;<br>Form provides a backstop: No matter what procedural&para;<br>hurdles a State’s own form imposes, the Federal Form&para;<br>guarantees that a simple means of registering to vote in&para;<br>federal elections will be available.4 Arizona’s reading&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 In&para;<br>&para;<br>the face of this straightforward explanation, the dissent maintains that it would be “nonsensical” for a less demanding federal form&para;<br>to exist alongside a more demanding state form.

See, e.g., Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460–&para;<br>461 (1991). Where it applies, “we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not&para;<br>to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the&para;<br>clear and manifest purpose of Congress.” Rice v. Santa Fe&para;<br>Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). That rule of&para;<br>construction rests on an assumption about congressional&para;<br>intent: that “Congress does not exercise lightly” the “extraordinary power” to “legislate in areas traditionally&para;<br>regulated by the States.” Gregory, supra, at 460. We have&para;<br>never mentioned such a principle in our Elections Clause&para;<br>cases.5 Siebold, for example, simply said that Elections&para;<br>——————&para;<br>a Federal Form, but also a separate set of either Arizona- or Californiaspecific instructions detailing the additional information the applicant&para;<br>must submit to the State. In ours, every eligible voter can be assured&para;<br>that if he does what the Federal Form says, he will be registered. The&para;<br>dissent therefore provides yet another compelling reason to interpret&para;<br>the statute our way.&para;<br>5 United States v. Gradwell, 243 U. S. 476 (1917), on which the dissent relies, see post, at 3–4 (opinion of ALITO, J.), is not to the contrary—&para;<br>indeed, it was not even a pre-emption case. In Gradwell, we held that&para;<br>a statute making it a federal crime “to defraud the United States”&para;<br>did not reach election fraud. 243 U. S., at 480, 483. The Court noted&para;<br>that the provision at issue was adopted in a tax-enforcement bill, and&para;<br>that Congress had enacted but then repealed other criminal statutes&para;<br>specifically covering election fraud. Id., at 481–483.&para;<br>The dissent cherry-picks some language from a sentence in Gradwell,&para;<br>see post, at 3–4, but the full sentence reveals its irrelevance to our case:&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

S., at 384. There is good reason for treating Elections Clause legislation differently: The assumption that&para;<br>Congress is reluctant to pre-empt does not hold when&para;<br>Congress acts under that constitutional provision, which&para;<br>empowers Congress to “make or alter” state election regulations. Art. I, §4, cl. 1. When Congress legislates with&para;<br>respect to the “Times, Places and Manner” of holding&para;<br>congressional elections, it necessarily displaces some&para;<br>element of a pre-existing legal regime erected by the&para;<br>States.6 Because the power the Elections Clause confers is&para;<br>——————&para;<br>“With it thus clearly established that the policy of Congress for so&para;<br>great a part of our constitutional life has been, and now is, to&para;<br>leave the conduct of the election of its members to state laws, administered by state officers, and that whenever it has assumed to&para;<br>regulate such elections it has done so by positive and clear statutes, such as were enacted in 1870, it would be a strained and&para;<br>unreasonable construction to apply to such elections this §37, originally a law for the protection of the revenue and for now fifty&para;<br>years confined in its application to ‘Offenses against the Operations of the Government’ as distinguished from the processes by&para;<br>which men are selected to conduct such operations.” 243 U. S., at&para;<br>485.&para;<br>Gradwell says nothing at all about pre-emption, or about how to construe statutes (like the NVRA) in which Congress has indisputably&para;<br>undertaken “to regulate such elections.” Ibid.&para;<br>6 The dissent counters that this is so “whenever Congress legislates in&para;<br>an area of concurrent state and federal power.” Post, at 5 (opinion of&para;<br>ALITO, J.). True, but irrelevant: Elections Clause legislation is unique&para;<br>precisely because it always falls within an area of concurrent state and&para;<br>federal power. Put differently, all action under the Elections Clause&para;<br>displaces some element of a pre-existing state regulatory regime,&para;<br>because the text of the Clause confers the power to do exactly (and only)&para;<br>that. By contrast, even laws enacted under the Commerce Clause&para;<br>(arguably the other enumerated power whose exercise is most likely to&para;<br>trench on state regulatory authority) will not always implicate concurrent state power—a prohibition on the interstate transport of a commodity, for example.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>none other than the power to pre-empt, the reasonable&para;<br>assumption is that the statutory text accurately communicates the scope of Congress’s pre-emptive intent. Moreover, the federalism concerns underlying the presumption&para;<br>in the Supremacy Clause context are somewhat weaker&para;<br>here. Unlike the States’ “historic police powers,” Rice,&para;<br>supra, at 230, the States’ role in regulating congressional&para;<br>elections—while weighty and worthy of respect—has&para;<br>always existed subject to the express qualification that it&para;<br>“terminates according to federal law.” Buckman Co. v.&para;<br>Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341, 347 (2001). In&para;<br>sum, there is no compelling reason not to read Elections&para;<br>Clause legislation simply to mean what it says.&para;<br>We conclude that the fairest reading of the statute is&para;<br>that a state-imposed requirement of evidence of citizenship not required by the Federal Form is “inconsistent&para;<br>with” the NVRA’s mandate that States “accept and use”&para;<br>the Federal Form. Siebold, supra, at 397. If this reading&para;<br>prevails, the Elections Clause requires that Arizona’s rule&para;<br>give way.&para;<br>We note, however, that while the NVRA forbids States&para;<br>to demand that an applicant submit additional information beyond that required by the Federal Form, it does&para;<br>not preclude States from “deny[ing] registration based on&para;<br>information in their possession establishing the applicant’s ineligibility.”7 Brief for United States as Amicus&para;<br>Curiae 24. The NVRA clearly contemplates that not every&para;<br>submitted Federal Form will result in registration. See&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 The&para;<br>&para;<br>dissent seems to think this position of ours incompatible with&para;<br>our reading of §1973gg–6(a)(1)(B), which requires a State to “ensure&para;<br>that any eligible applicant is registered to vote in an election . . . if the&para;<br>valid voter registration form of the applicant is postmarked” by a&para;<br>certain date. See post, at 9–10 (opinion of ALITO, J.). What the dissent&para;<br>overlooks is that §1973gg–6(a)(1)(B) only requires a State to register an&para;<br>“eligible applicant” who submits a timely Federal Form.

Cf. also Art. II, §1, cl. 2 (“Each State shall&para;<br>appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may&para;<br>direct,” presidential electors).

Cf. Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22,&para;<br>62 (1932) (the Court will “ascertain whether a construction&para;<br>of the statute is fairly possible by which the [constitutional]&para;<br>question may be avoided” (emphasis added)). Happily,&para;<br>we are spared that necessity, since the statute provides&para;<br>another means by which Arizona may obtain information&para;<br>needed for enforcement.&para;<br>Section 1973gg–7(b)(1) of the Act provides that the&para;<br>Federal Form “may require only such identifying information (including the signature of the applicant) and&para;<br>other information (including data relating to previous&para;<br>registration by the applicant), as is necessary to enable&para;<br>the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the applicant and to administer voter registration&para;<br>and other parts of the election process.” At oral argument,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 In their reply brief, petitioners suggest for the first time that “registration is itself a qualification to vote.” Reply Brief for State Petitioners 24 (emphasis deleted); see also post, at 1, 16 (opinion of THOMAS, J.);&para;<br>cf.

Edgar, 56 F. 3d 791, 793&para;<br>(CA7 1995). We resolve this case on the theory on which it has hitherto&para;<br>been litigated: that citizenship (not registration) is the voter qualification Arizona seeks to enforce.

That is&para;<br>to say, §1973gg–7(b)(1) acts as both a ceiling and a floor&para;<br>with respect to the contents of the Federal Form. We need&para;<br>not consider the Government’s contention that despite the&para;<br>statute’s statement that the EAC “may” require on the&para;<br>Federal Form information “necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the&para;<br>applicant,” other provisions of the Act indicate that such&para;<br>action is statutorily required. That is because we think&para;<br>that—by analogy to the rule of statutory interpretation&para;<br>that avoids questionable constitutionality—validly conferred discretionary executive authority is properly exercised (as the Government has proposed) to avoid serious&para;<br>constitutional doubt. That is to say, it is surely permissible if not requisite for the Government to say that necessary information which may be required will be required.&para;<br>Since, pursuant to the Government’s concession, a State&para;<br>may request that the EAC alter the Federal Form to include information the State deems necessary to determine&para;<br>eligibility, see §1973gg–7(a)(2); Tr. of Oral Arg. 55 (United&para;<br>States), and may challenge the EAC’s rejection of that&para;<br>request in a suit under the Administrative Procedure Act,&para;<br>see 5 U. S. C. §701–706, no constitutional doubt is raised&para;<br>by giving the “accept and use” provision of the NVRA its&para;<br>fairest reading. That alternative means of enforcing its&para;<br>constitutional power to determine voting qualifications&para;<br>remains open to Arizona here. In 2005, the EAC divided&para;<br>2-to-2 on the request by Arizona to include the evidence-ofcitizenship requirement among the state-specific instructions on the Federal Form, App. 225, which meant that no&para;<br>action could be taken, see 42 U. S. C. §15328 (“Any action&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

Arizona did not challenge&para;<br>that agency action (or rather inaction) by seeking APA&para;<br>review in federal court, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 11–12 (Arizona), but we are aware of nothing that prevents Arizona&para;<br>from renewing its request.10 Should the EAC’s inaction&para;<br>persist, Arizona would have the opportunity to establish in&para;<br>a reviewing court that a mere oath will not suffice to&para;<br>effectuate its citizenship requirement and that the EAC is&para;<br>therefore under a nondiscretionary duty to include Arizona’s concrete evidence requirement on the Federal Form.&para;<br>See 5 U. S. C. §706(1).

Indeed, the whole request process appears to be&para;<br>entirely informal, Arizona’s prior request having been submitted by&para;<br>e-mail. See App. 181.&para;<br>The EAC currently lacks a quorum—indeed, the Commission has not&para;<br>a single active Commissioner.

S. C. §706(1). It is a nice point, which we need not resolve here,&para;<br>whether a court can compel agency action that the agency itself, for&para;<br>lack of the statutorily required quorum, is incapable of taking. If the&para;<br>answer to that is no, Arizona might then be in a position to assert a&para;<br>constitutional right to demand concrete evidence of citizenship apart&para;<br>from the Federal Form.&para;<br>11 The EAC recently approved a state-specific instruction for Louisiana requiring applicants who lack a Louisiana driver’s license, ID card,&para;<br>or Social Security number to attach additional documentation to the&para;<br>completed Federal Form.

If the Court is&para;<br>skeptical of the basic idea of a presumption against preemption as a helpful instrument of construction in express&para;<br>pre-emption cases, see Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,&para;<br>505 U.

But&para;<br>the Court has nonetheless recognized that “when the text&para;<br>of a pre-emption clause is susceptible of more than one&para;<br>plausible reading, courts ordinarily ‘accept the reading that&para;<br>disfavors pre-emption.’ ” Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555&para;<br>U. S. 70, 77 (2008) (quoting Bates v. Dow Agrosciences&para;<br>LLC, 544 U. S. 431, 449 (2005)). This principle is best&para;<br>understood, perhaps, not as a presumption but as a cautionary principle to ensure that pre-emption does not go&para;<br>beyond the strict requirements of the statutory command.&para;<br>The principle has two dimensions: Courts must be careful&para;<br>not to give an unduly broad interpretation to ambiguous&para;<br>or imprecise language Congress uses. And they must&para;<br>confine their opinions to avoid overextending a federal&para;<br>statute’s pre-emptive reach. Error on either front may put&para;<br>at risk the validity and effectiveness of laws that Congress did not intend to disturb and that a State has&para;<br>deemed important to its scheme of governance.

This case illustrates the&para;<br>point. The separate States have a continuing, essential&para;<br>interest in the integrity and accuracy of the process used&para;<br>to select both state and federal officials. The States pay&para;<br>the costs of holding these elections, which for practical&para;<br>reasons often overlap so that the two sets of officials are&para;<br>selected at the same time, on the same ballots, by the&para;<br>same voters.

I, §2, cl. 1, and the Seventeenth Amendment&para;<br>authorize States to determine the qualifications of voters&para;<br>in federal elections, which necessarily includes the related&para;<br>power to determine whether those qualifications are satisfied. To avoid substantial constitutional problems created&para;<br>by interpreting §1973gg–4(a)(1) to permit Congress to effectively countermand this authority, I would construe&para;<br>the law as only requiring Arizona to accept and use the&para;<br>form as part of its voter registration process, leaving the&para;<br>State free to request whatever additional information it&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>determines is necessary to ensure that voters meet the&para;<br>qualifications it has the constitutional authority to establish.&para;<br>Under this interpretation, Arizona did “accept&para;<br>and use” the federal form. Accordingly, there is no conflict between Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §16–166(F) (West&para;<br>Cum. Supp. 2012) and §1973gg–4(a)(1) and, thus, no&para;<br>pre-emption.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In 2002, Congress created the Election Assistance&para;<br>Commission (EAC), 42 U. S. C. §15321 et seq., and gave&para;<br>it the ongoing responsibility of “develop[ing] a mail voter&para;<br>registration application form for elections for Federal&para;<br>office” “in consultation with the chief election officers of&para;<br>the States.” §1973gg–7(a)(2). Under the NVRA, “[e]ach&para;<br>State shall accept and use the mail voter registration&para;<br>application form” the EAC develops. §1973gg–4(a)(1). The&para;<br>NVRA also states in a subsequent provision that “[i]n&para;<br>addition to accepting and using the form described in&para;<br>paragraph (1), a State may develop and use a mail voter&para;<br>registration form . . . for the registration of voters in elections for Federal office” so long as it satisfies the same&para;<br>criteria as the federal form. §1973gg–4(a)(2).&para;<br>Section 1973gg–7(b) enumerates the criteria for the federal form. The form “may require only such identifying information . . . and other information . . . as is necessary&para;<br>to enable the appropriate State election official to assess&para;<br>the eligibility of the applicant.” §1973gg–7(b)(1). The&para;<br>federal form must also “specif[y] each eligibility requirement (including citizenship),” “contai[n] an attestation&para;<br>that the applicant meets each such requirement,” and “requir[e] the signature of the applicant, under penalty of&para;<br>perjury.” §§1973gg–7(b)(2)(A)–(C). Insofar as citizenship&para;<br>is concerned, the standard federal form contains the bare&para;<br>statutory requirements; individuals seeking to vote need&para;<br>only attest that they are citizens and sign under penalty of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

See Ariz. Const., Art. VII,&para;<br>§2. In 2004, Arizona citizens enacted Proposition 200, the&para;<br>law at issue in this case. Proposition 200 provides that&para;<br>“[t]he county recorder shall reject any application for&para;<br>registration that is not accompanied by satisfactory evidence of United States citizenship.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.&para;<br>§16–166(F). The law sets forth several examples of satisfactory evidence, including driver’s license number, birth&para;<br>certificate, U. S. passport, naturalization documents, and&para;<br>various tribal identification documents for Indians. §16–&para;<br>166(F)(1)–(6).&para;<br>Respondents, joined by the United States, allege that these&para;<br>state requirements are pre-empted by the NVRA’s mandate that all States “accept and use” the federal form&para;<br>promulgated by the EAC. §1973gg–4(a)(1). They contend&para;<br>that the phrase “accept and use” requires a State presented with a completed federal form to register the individual to vote without requiring any additional information.&para;<br>Arizona advances an alternative interpretation. It argues that §1973gg–4(a)(1) is satisfied so long as the State&para;<br>“accepts and use[s]” the federal form as part of its voter&para;<br>qualification process. For example, a State “accepts and&para;<br>use[s]” the federal form by allowing individuals to file it,&para;<br>even if the State requires additional identifying information to establish citizenship. In Arizona’s view, it “accepts and uses” the federal form in the same way that&para;<br>an airline “accepts and uses” electronic tickets but also&para;<br>requires an individual seeking to board a plane to demonstrate that he is the person named on the ticket.

The Seventeenth&para;<br>Amendment, which provides for direct election of Senators,&para;<br>contains an identical clause. That language is susceptible of only one interpretation: States have the authority “to control who may vote in congressional elections” so&para;<br>long as they do not “establish special requirements that do&para;<br>not apply in elections for the state legislature.” U.

The Framers did not intend&para;<br>to leave voter qualifications to Congress. Indeed, James&para;<br>Madison explicitly rejected that possibility:&para;<br>“The definition of the right of suffrage is very justly&para;<br>regarded as a fundamental article of republican government. It was incumbent on the convention, therefore,&para;<br>to define and establish this right in the Constitution. To have left it open for the occasional regulation&para;<br>of the Congress would have been improper.” The Federalist No. 52, at 323 (emphasis added).&para;<br>Congressional legislation of voter qualifications was not&para;<br>part of the Framers’ design.&para;<br>The Constitutional Convention did recognize a danger in&para;<br>leaving Congress “too dependent on the State governments” by allowing States to define congressional elector&para;<br>qualifications without limitation. Ibid. To address this&para;<br>concern, the Committee of Detail that drafted Article I, §2,&para;<br>“weighed the possibility of a federal property requirement,&para;<br>as well as several proposals that would have given the&para;<br>federal government the power to impose its own suffrage&para;<br>laws at some future time.” A. Keyssar, The Right to Vote&para;<br>18 (rev. ed. 2009) (hereafter Keyssar); see also 2 The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 139–140, 151,&para;<br>153, 163–165 (M. Farrand rev. ed. 1966) (text of several&para;<br>voter qualification provisions considered by the Committee&para;<br>of Detail).&para;<br>These efforts, however, were ultimately abandoned. Even&para;<br>if the convention had been able to agree on a uniform&para;<br>federal standard, the Framers knew that state ratification&para;<br>conventions likely would have rejected it. Madison ex-&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>plained that “reduc[ing] the different qualifications in the&para;<br>different States to one uniform rule would probably have&para;<br>been as dissatisfactory to some of the States as it would&para;<br>have been difficult to the convention.” The Federalist No.&para;<br>52, at 323; see also J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 217 (abridged ed. 1833) (same).&para;<br>Justice Story elaborated that setting voter qualifications&para;<br>in the Constitution could have jeopardized ratification,&para;<br>because it would have been difficult to convince States to&para;<br>give up their right to set voting qualifications. Id., at 216,&para;<br>218–219. See also Keyssar 306–313 (Tables A.1 and A.2)&para;<br>(state-by-state analysis of 18th- and 19th-century voter qualifications, including property, taxpaying, residency, sex,&para;<br>and race requirements).&para;<br>The Convention, thus, chose to respect the varied state&para;<br>voting rules and instead struck the balance enshrined in&para;<br>Article I, §2’s requirement that federal electors “shall have&para;<br>the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.” That compromise&para;<br>gave States free reign over federal voter qualifications&para;<br>but protected Congress by prohibiting States from changing the qualifications for federal electors unless they also&para;<br>altered qualifications for their own legislatures. See The&para;<br>Federalist No. 52, at 323. This balance left the States&para;<br>with nearly complete control over voter qualifications.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Respondents appear to concede that States have the sole&para;<br>authority to establish voter qualifications, see, e.g., Brief&para;<br>for Gonzalez Respondents 63, but nevertheless argue that&para;<br>Congress can determine whether those qualifications are&para;<br>satisfied. See, e.g., id., at 61. The practical effect of respondents’ position is to read Article I, §2, out of the Constitution. As the majority correctly recognizes, “the power&para;<br>to establish voting requirements is of little value without&para;<br>the power to enforce those requirements.” See ante, at 15.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>For this reason, the Voter Qualifications Clause gives&para;<br>States the authority not only to set qualifications but&para;<br>also the power to verify whether those qualifications are&para;<br>satisfied.&para;<br>This understanding of Article I, §2, is consistent with&para;<br>powers enjoyed by the States at the founding. For instance, ownership of real or personal property was a common prerequisite to voting, see Keyssar 306–313 (Tables&para;<br>A.1 and A.2). To verify that this qualification was satisfied, States might look to proof of tax payments. See C.&para;<br>Williamson, American Suffrage from Property to Democracy, 1760–1860, p. 32 (1960). In other instances, States&para;<br>relied on personal knowledge of fellow citizens to verify&para;<br>voter eligibility. Keyssar 24 (“In some locales, particularly&para;<br>in the South, voting was still an oral and public act: men&para;<br>assembled before election judges, waited for their names&para;<br>to be called, and then announced which candidates they&para;<br>supported”). States have always had the power to ensure&para;<br>that only those qualified under state law to cast ballots&para;<br>exercised the franchise.&para;<br>Perhaps in part because many requirements (such as&para;<br>property ownership or taxpayer status) were independently documented and verifiable, States in 1789 did not&para;<br>generally “register” voters using highly formalized procedures. See id., at 122. Over time, States replaced their&para;<br>informal systems for determining eligibility, with more&para;<br>formalized pre-voting registration regimes. See An Act in&para;<br>Addition to the Several Acts for Regulating Elections,&para;<br>1800 Mass. Acts ch. 74, in Acts and Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 96 (1897) (Massachusetts’ 1801&para;<br>voter registration law). But modern voter registration&para;<br>serves the same basic purpose as the practices used by&para;<br>States in the Colonies and early Federal Republic. The&para;<br>fact that States have liberalized voting qualifications and&para;<br>streamlined the verification process through registration&para;<br>does not alter the basic fact that States possess broad&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.&para;<br>THOMAS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>authority to set voter qualifications and to verify that they&para;<br>are met.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Both text and history confirm that States have the exclusive authority to set voter qualifications and to determine whether those qualifications are satisfied. The&para;<br>United States nevertheless argues that Congress has the&para;<br>authority under Article I, §4, “to set the rules for voter&para;<br>registration in federal elections.” Brief for United States&para;<br>as Amicus Curiae 33 (hereafter Brief for United States).&para;<br>Neither the text nor the original understanding of Article&para;<br>I, §4, supports that position.&para;<br>1&para;<br>Article I, §4, gives States primary responsibility for&para;<br>regulating the “Times, Places and Manner of holding&para;<br>Elections” and authorizes Congress to “at any time by Law&para;<br>make or alter such Regulations.”1 Along with the Seventeenth Amendment, this provision grants Congress power&para;<br>only over the “when, where, and how” of holding congressional elections.

Id., at 20.&para;<br>The Constitution does not use the word “Manner” in isolation; rather, “after providing for qualifications, times,&para;<br>and places, the Constitution described the residuum as ‘the&para;<br>Manner of holding Elections.’ This precise phrase seems&para;<br>to have been newly coined to denote a subset of traditional&para;<br>‘manner’ regulation.” Ibid. (emphasis deleted; footnote&para;<br>omitted). Consistent with this view, during the state&para;<br>ratification debates, the “Manner of holding Elections” was&para;<br>construed to mean the circumstances under which elections were held and the mechanics of the actual election.&para;<br>See 4 Debates in the Several State Conventions on the&para;<br>Adoption of the Federal Constitution 71 (J. Elliot 2d&para;<br>ed. 1863) (hereafter Elliot’s Debates) (“The power over the&para;<br>manner of elections does not include that of saying who&para;<br>shall vote . . . the power over the manner only enables&para;<br>them to determine how those electors shall elect—whether&para;<br>by ballot, or by vote, or by any other way” (John Steele at&para;<br>the North Carolina ratification debates)); A Pennsylvanian&para;<br>to the New York Convention, Pennsylvania Gazette, June&para;<br>11, 1788, in 20 Documentary History 1145 (J.

The text of the Times, Places and Manner Clause,&para;<br>therefore, cannot be read to authorize Congress to dictate&para;<br>voter eligibility to the States.&para;<br>2&para;<br>Article I, §4, also cannot be read to limit a State’s authority to set voter qualifications because the more specific&para;<br>language of Article I, §2, expressly gives that authority to&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v.

See ante, at 13 (“One cannot read [Article I,&para;<br>§4,] as treating implicitly what [Article I, §2, and Article&para;<br>II, §1,] regulate explicitly”). As the Court observed just&para;<br>last Term, “[a] well established canon of statutory interpretation succinctly captures the problem: ‘[I]t is a&para;<br>commonplace of statutory construction that the specific&para;<br>governs the general.’ ” RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v.&para;<br>Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.

The Federalist No. 60, at 368. Hamilton explained why Article I,&para;<br>§2’s Voter Qualifications Clause foreclosed this argument:&para;<br>“The truth is that there is no method of securing to&para;<br>the rich the preference apprehended but by prescribing qualifications of property either for those who may&para;<br>elect or be elected.

The North Carolina debates provide a particularly direct example. There, delegate John Steele relied&para;<br>on the established “maxim of universal jurisprudence, of&para;<br>reason and common sense, that an instrument or deed of&para;<br>writing shall be construed as to give validity to all parts&para;<br>of it, if it can be done without involving any absurdity” in&para;<br>support of the argument that Article I, §2’s grant of voter&para;<br>qualifications to the States required a limited reading of&para;<br>Article I, §4. 4 Elliot’s Debates 71.&para;<br>This was no isolated view. See 2 id., at 50–51 (Massachusetts delegate Rufus King observing that “the power of&para;<br>control given by [Article I, §4,] extends to the manner of&para;<br>election, not the qualifications of the electors”); 4 id., at 61&para;<br>(same, North Carolina’s William Davie); 3 id., at 202–203&para;<br>(same, Virginia delegate Edmund Randolph); Roger Sherman, A Citizen of New Haven: Observations on the New&para;<br>Federal Constitution, Connecticut Courant, Jan. 7, 1788,&para;<br>in 15 Documentary History 282 (J.

The Times, Places and Manner&para;<br>Clause was designed to address the possibility that States&para;<br>might refuse to hold any federal elections at all, eliminating Congress, and by extension the Federal Government.&para;<br>As Hamilton explained, “every government ought to contain in itself the means of its own preservation.” The&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v.

Most of the remaining&para;<br>cases cited by respondents and the Government merely&para;<br>confirm that Congress’ power to regulate the “Manner&para;<br>of holding Elections” is limited to regulating events surrounding the when, where, and how of actually casting&para;<br>ballots. See, e.g., United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299&para;<br>(1941) (upholding federal regulation of ballot fraud in&para;<br>primary voting); Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.

It is, thus, difficult to&para;<br>maintain that the Times, Places and Manner Clause gives&para;<br>Congress power beyond regulating the casting of ballots&para;<br>and related activities, even as a matter of precedent.2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Article&para;<br>&para;<br>I, §§2 and 4, and the Seventeenth Amendment concern congressional elections. The NVRA’s “accept and use” requirement applies&para;<br>to all federal elections, even presidential elections. See §1973gg–&para;<br>4(a)(1). This Court has recognized, however, that “the state legislature’s power to select the manner for appointing [presidential] electors&para;<br>is plenary; it may, if it chooses, select the electors itself.” Bush v.

Arizona did, however, argue that respondent’s interpretation&para;<br>of §1973gg–4(a)(1) would raise constitutional concerns. As&para;<br>discussed, supra, I too am concerned that respondent’s&para;<br>interpretation of §1973gg–4(a)(1) would render the statute&para;<br>unconstitutional under Article I, §2. Accordingly, I would&para;<br>interpret §1973gg–4(a)(1) to avoid the constitutional problems discussed above. See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S.&para;<br>678, 689 (2001) (“ ‘[I]t is a cardinal principle’ of statutory&para;<br>interpretation, however, that when an Act of Congress&para;<br>raises ‘a serious doubt’ as to its constitutionality, ‘this&para;<br>Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the&para;<br>statute is fairly possible by which the question may be&para;<br>avoided’ ” (quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.

Arizona sets citizenship as a qualification to vote,&para;<br>and it wishes to verify citizenship, as it is authorized to do&para;<br>under Article 1, §2. It matters not whether the United&para;<br>States has specified one way in which it believes Arizona&para;<br>might be able to verify citizenship; Arizona has the independent constitutional authority to verify citizenship in&para;<br>the way it deems necessary.

It is plausible that&para;<br>Arizona “accept[s] and use[s]” the federal form under&para;<br>§1973gg–4(a)(1) so long as it receives the form and considers it as part of its voter application process. See post, at&para;<br>6–10 (ALITO, J., dissenting); 677 F. 3d, at 444 (Rawlinson,&para;<br>J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); 624 F. 3d&para;<br>1162, 1205–1208 (CA9 2010) (Kozinski, C.

See Art. I, §2, cl. 1&para;<br>(House); Amdt. 17 (Senate). The States also have the&para;<br>default authority to regulate federal voter registration.&para;<br>See Art. I, §4, cl. 1. Exercising its right to set federal voter&para;<br>qualifications, Arizona, like every other State, permits&para;<br>only U. S. citizens to vote in federal elections, and Arizona&para;<br>has concluded that this requirement cannot be effectively&para;<br>enforced unless applicants for registration are required to&para;<br>provide proof of citizenship. According to the Court, however, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA)&para;<br>deprives Arizona of this authority. I do not think that this&para;<br>is what Congress intended.&para;<br>I also doubt that Congress meant for the success of&para;<br>an application for voter registration to depend on which of&para;<br>two valid but substantially different registration forms the&para;<br>applicant happens to fill out and submit, but that is how&para;<br>the Court reads the NVRA. The Court interprets one&para;<br>provision, 42 U. S.

I find it very hard to believe that this is&para;<br>what Congress had in mind.&para;<br>These results are not required by the NVRA. Proper&para;<br>respect for the constitutional authority of the States demands a clear indication of a congressional intent to preempt state laws enforcing voter qualifications. And while&para;<br>the relevant provisions of the Act are hardly models of&para;<br>clarity, their best reading is that the States need not&para;<br>treat the federal form as a complete voter registration&para;<br>application.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>In light of the States’ authority under the Elections&para;<br>Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, §4, cl. 1, I would begin&para;<br>by applying a presumption against pre-emption of the&para;<br>Arizona law requiring voter registration applicants to&para;<br>submit proof of citizenship. Under the Elections Clause,&para;<br>the States have the authority to specify the times, places,&para;<br>and manner of federal elections except to the extent that&para;<br>Congress chooses to provide otherwise. And in recognition&para;<br>of this allocation of authority, it is appropriate to presume&para;<br>that the States retain this authority unless Congress has&para;<br>clearly manifested a contrary intent. The Court states&para;<br>that “[w]e have never mentioned [the presumption against&para;<br>pre-emption] in our Elections Clause cases,” ante, at 10,&para;<br>but in United States v. Gradwell, 243 U. S. 476 (1917), we&para;<br>read a federal statute narrowly out of deference to the&para;<br>States’ traditional authority in this area. In doing so, we&para;<br>explained that “the policy of Congress for [a] great . . . part&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>of our constitutional life has been . . . to leave the conduct&para;<br>of the election of its members to state laws, administered&para;<br>by state officers, and that whenever it has assumed to&para;<br>regulate such elections it has done so by positive and clear&para;<br>statutes.” Id., at 485 (emphasis added).1 The presumption&para;<br>against pre-emption applies with full force when Congress&para;<br>legislates in a “field which the States have traditionally&para;<br>occupied,” Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218,&para;<br>230 (1947), and the NVRA was the first significant federal&para;<br>regulation of voter registration enacted under the Elections Clause since Reconstruction.&para;<br>The Court has it exactly backwards when it declines to&para;<br>apply the presumption against pre-emption because “the&para;<br>federalism concerns underlying the presumption in the Supremacy Clause context are somewhat weaker” in an Elections Clause case like this one. Ante, at 12. To the&para;<br>contrary, Arizona has a “ ‘compelling interest in preserving&para;<br>the integrity of its election process’ ” that the Constitution&para;<br>recognizes and that the Court’s reading of the Act seriously undermines. Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1, 4 (2006)&para;<br>(per curiam) (quoting Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 231 (1989)).&para;<br>By reserving to the States default responsibility for&para;<br>administering federal elections, the Elections Clause&para;<br>protects several critical values that the Court disregards.&para;<br>First, as Madison explained in defense of the Elections&para;<br>Clause at the Virginia Convention, “[i]t was found neces——————&para;<br>1 The Court argues that Gradwell is irrelevant, observing that there&para;<br>was no state law directly at issue in that case, which concerned a prosecution under a federal statute. Ante, at 10, n. 5. But the same is&para;<br>true of Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371 (1880), on which the Court relies&para;<br>in the very next breath. In any event, it is hard to see why a presumption about the effect of federal law on the conduct of congressional&para;<br>elections should have less force when the federal law is alleged to&para;<br>conflict with a state law. If anything, one would expect the opposite&para;<br>to be true.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>sary to leave the regulation of [federal elections], in the&para;<br>first place, to the state governments, as being best acquainted with the situation of the people.” 3 Records of&para;<br>the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 312 (M. Farrand ed.&para;<br>1911). Because the States are closer to the people, the&para;<br>Framers thought that state regulation of federal elections&para;<br>would “in ordinary cases . . . be both more convenient and&para;<br>more satisfactory.” The Federalist No. 59, p. 360 (C.&para;<br>Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).&para;<br>Second, as we have previously observed, the integrity of&para;<br>federal elections is a subject over which the States and the&para;<br>Federal Government “are mutually concerned.” Ex parte&para;<br>Siebold, 100 U. S. 371, 391 (1880). By giving States a role&para;<br>in the administration of federal elections, the Elections&para;<br>Clause reflects the States’ interest in the selection of the&para;<br>individuals on whom they must rely to represent their&para;<br>interests in the National Legislature. See U. S. Term&para;<br>Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 858–859 (1995)&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., dissenting).&para;<br>Third, the Elections Clause’s default rule helps to protect the States’ authority to regulate state and local elections. As a practical matter, it would be very burdensome&para;<br>for a State to maintain separate federal and state registration processes with separate federal and state voter rolls.&para;<br>For that reason, any federal regulation in this area is&para;<br>likely to displace not only state control of federal elections&para;<br>but also state control of state and local elections.&para;<br>Needless to say, when Congress believes that some&para;<br>overriding national interest justifies federal regulation, it&para;<br>has the power to “make or alter” state laws specifying the&para;<br>“Times, Places and Manner” of federal elections. Art. I,&para;<br>§4, cl. 1. But we should expect Congress to speak clearly&para;<br>when it decides to displace a default rule enshrined in&para;<br>the text of the Constitution that serves such important&para;<br>purposes.&para;<br>The Court answers that when Congress exercises its&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

But the same is true whenever&para;<br>Congress legislates in an area of concurrent state and federal power. A federal law regulating the operation of&para;<br>grain warehouses, for example, necessarily alters the&para;<br>“pre-existing legal regime erected by the States,” see Rice,&para;<br>supra, at 229–230—even if only by regulating an activity&para;<br>the States had chosen not to constrain.2 In light of Arizona’s constitutionally codified interest in the integrity of&para;<br>its federal elections, “it is incumbent upon the federal courts&para;<br>to be certain” that Congress intended to pre-empt Arizona’s law. Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S.&para;<br>234, 243 (1985).&para;<br>B&para;<br>The canon of constitutional avoidance also counsels&para;<br>against the Court’s reading of the Act. As the Court&para;<br>acknowledges, the Constitution reserves for the States the&para;<br>power to decide who is qualified to vote in federal elections. Ante, at 13–15; see Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S.&para;<br>112, 210–211 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and&para;<br>dissenting in part). The Court also recognizes that, although Congress generally has the authority to regulate&para;<br>the “Times, Places and Manner of holding” such elections,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The Court observes that the Commerce Clause, unlike the Elections&para;<br>Clause, empowers Congress to legislate in areas that do not implicate&para;<br>concurrent state power. Ante, at 12, n. 6. Apparently the Court means&para;<br>that the presumption against pre-emption only applies in those unusual cases in which it is unclear whether a federal statute even touches on&para;<br>subject matter that the States may regulate under their broad police&para;<br>powers. I doubt that the Court is prepared to abide by this cramped&para;<br>understanding of the presumption against pre-emption. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Hillman v. Maretta, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6) (“There is&para;<br>therefore ‘a presumption against pre-emption’ of state laws governing&para;<br>domestic relations” (quoting Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U.

Ante, at 15; see ante, at 4–8 (THOMAS, J.,&para;<br>dissenting). The Court nevertheless reads the NVRA to&para;<br>restrict Arizona’s ability to enforce its law providing that&para;<br>only United States citizens may vote. See Ariz. Const.,&para;<br>Art. VII, §2. We are normally more reluctant to interpret federal statutes as upsetting “the usual constitutional&para;<br>balance of federal and state powers.” Gregory v. Ashcroft,&para;<br>501 U. S. 452, 460 (1991); see Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527,&para;<br>540 (1947) (“[W]hen the Federal Government . . . radically&para;<br>readjusts the balance of state and national authority,&para;<br>those charged with the duty of legislating are reasonably&para;<br>explicit”).&para;<br>In refusing to give any weight to Arizona’s interest in&para;<br>enforcing its voter qualifications, the Court suggests that&para;<br>the State could return to the Election Assistance Commission and renew its request for a change to the federal&para;<br>form. Ante, at 16–17. But that prospect does little to&para;<br>assuage constitutional concerns. The EAC currently has&para;<br>no members, and there is no reason to believe that it will&para;<br>be restored to life in the near future. If that situation&para;<br>persists, Arizona’s ability to obtain a judicial resolution of&para;<br>its constitutional claim is problematic. The most that the&para;<br>Court is prepared to say is that the State “might” succeed&para;<br>by seeking a writ of mandamus, and failing that, “might”&para;<br>be able to mount a constitutional challenge. Ante, at 17,&para;<br>n. 10. The Court sends the State to traverse a veritable&para;<br>procedural obstacle course in the hope of obtaining a&para;<br>judicial decision on the constitutionality of the relevant&para;<br>provisions of the NVRA. A sensible interpretation of the&para;<br>Act would obviate these difficulties.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The NVRA does not come close to manifesting the clear&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U.

Indeed, even if&para;<br>neither the presumption against pre-emption nor the&para;<br>canon of constitutional avoidance applied, the better reading of the Act would be that Arizona is free to require&para;<br>those who use the federal form to supplement their applications with proof of citizenship.&para;<br>I agree with the Court that the phrase “accept and use,”&para;<br>when read in isolation, is ambiguous, ante, at 6–7, but&para;<br>I disagree with the Court’s conclusion that §1973gg–&para;<br>4(a)(1)’s use of that phrase means that a State must treat&para;<br>the federal form as a complete application and must either&para;<br>grant or deny registration without requiring that the applicant supply additional information. Instead, I would&para;<br>hold that a State “accept[s] and use[s]” the federal form so&para;<br>long as it uses the form as a meaningful part of the registration process.&para;<br>The Court begins its analysis of §1973gg–4(a)(1)’s context by examining unrelated uses of the word “accept”&para;<br>elsewhere in the United States Code. Ante, at 7–8. But a&para;<br>better place to start is to ask what it normally means to&para;<br>“accept and use” an application form. When the phrase is&para;<br>used in that context, it is clear that an organization can&para;<br>“accept and use” a form that it does not treat as a complete&para;<br>application. For example, many colleges and universities&para;<br>accept and use the Common Application for Undergraduate College Admission but also require that applicants&para;<br>submit various additional forms or documents. See Common Application, 2012–2013 College Deadlines, Fees, and&para;<br>Requirements, https://www.commonapp.org/CommonApp/&para;<br>MemberRequirements.aspx (all Internet materials as&para;<br>visited June 10, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court’s&para;<br>case file). Similarly, the Social Security Administration&para;<br>undoubtedly “accepts and uses” its Social Security card&para;<br>application form even though someone applying for a card&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>must also prove that he or she is a citizen or has a qualifying immigration status. See Application for a Social Security Card, Form SS–5 (2011), http://www.socialsecurity.gov/&para;<br>online/ss-5.pdf. As such examples illustrate, when an&para;<br>organization says that it “accepts and uses” an application&para;<br>form, it does not necessarily mean that the form constitutes a complete application.&para;<br>That is not to say that the phrase “accept and use” is&para;<br>meaningless when issued as a “government diktat” in&para;<br>§1973gg–4(a)(1). Ante, at 7. Arizona could not be said to&para;<br>“accept and use” the federal form if it required applicants&para;<br>who submit that form to provide all the same information&para;<br>a second time on a separate state form. But Arizona does&para;<br>nothing of the kind. To the contrary, the entire basis for&para;<br>respondents’ suit is that Proposition 200 mandates that&para;<br>applicants provide information that does not appear on a&para;<br>completed federal form. Although §1973gg–4(a)(1) forbids&para;<br>States from requiring applicants who use the federal&para;<br>form to submit a duplicative state form, nothing in that provision’s text prevents Arizona from insisting that federal&para;<br>form applicants supplement their applications with additional information.&para;<br>That understanding of §1973gg–4(a)(1) is confirmed by&para;<br>§1973gg–4(a)(2), which allows States to design and use&para;<br>their own voter registration forms “[i]n addition to accepting and using” the federal form. The Act clearly permits&para;<br>States to require proof of citizenship on their own forms,&para;<br>see §§1973gg–4(a)(2) and 1973gg–7(b)—a step that Arizona has taken and that today’s decision does not disturb.&para;<br>Thus, under the Court’s approach, whether someone can&para;<br>register to vote in Arizona without providing proof of&para;<br>citizenship will depend on the happenstance of which of&para;<br>two alternative forms the applicant completes. That could&para;<br>not possibly be what Congress intended; it is as if the&para;<br>Internal Revenue Service issued two sets of personal&para;<br>income tax forms with different tax rates.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>We could avoid this nonsensical result by holding that&para;<br>the Act lets the States decide for themselves what information “is necessary . . . to assess the eligibility of the&para;<br>applicant”—both by designing their own forms and by&para;<br>requiring that federal form applicants provide supplemental information when appropriate. §1973gg–7(b)(1).&para;<br>The Act’s provision for state forms shows that the purpose&para;<br>of the federal form is not to supplant the States’ authority&para;<br>in this area but to facilitate interstate voter registration&para;<br>drives. Thanks to the federal form, volunteers distributing voter registration materials at a shopping mall in&para;<br>Yuma can give a copy of the same form to every person&para;<br>they meet without attempting to distinguish between&para;<br>residents of Arizona and California. See H. R. Rep. No.&para;<br>103–9, p. 10 (1993) (“Uniform mail forms will permit voter&para;<br>registration drives through a regional or national mailing,&para;<br>or for more than one State at a central location, such as a&para;<br>city where persons from a number of neighboring States&para;<br>work, shop or attend events”). The federal form was&para;<br>meant to facilitate voter registration drives, not to take&para;<br>away the States’ traditional authority to decide what&para;<br>information registrants must supply.3&para;<br>The Court purports to find support for its contrary&para;<br>approach in §1973gg–6(a)(1)(B), which says that a State&para;<br>must “ensure that any eligible applicant is registered to&para;<br>vote in an election . . . if the valid voter registration form&para;<br>of the applicant is postmarked” within a specified period.&para;<br>Ante, at 8–9. The Court understands §1973gg–6(a)(1)(B)&para;<br>to mean that a State must register an eligible applicant if&para;<br>he or she submits a “ ‘valid voter registration form.’ ” Ante,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The Court argues that the federal form would not accomplish this&para;<br>purpose under my interpretation because “a volunteer in Yuma would&para;<br>have to give every prospective voter not only a Federal Form, but also&para;<br>a separate set of either Arizona- or California-specific instructions.”&para;<br>Ante, at 10, n. 4. But this is exactly what Congress envisioned. Eighteen of the federal form’s 23 pages are state-specific instructions.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.&para;<br>ALITO, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>at 9. But when read in context, that provision simply&para;<br>identifies the time within which a State must process&para;<br>registration applications; it says nothing about whether&para;<br>a State may require the submission of supplemental information. The Court’s more expansive interpretation of&para;<br>§1973gg–6(a)(1)(B) sneaks in a qualification that is nowhere to be found in the text. The Court takes pains to&para;<br>say that a State need not register an applicant who&para;<br>properly completes and submits a federal form but is&para;<br>known by the State to be ineligible. See ante, at 12–13.&para;<br>But the Court takes the position that a State may not&para;<br>demand that an applicant supply any additional information to confirm voting eligibility. Nothing in §1973gg–&para;<br>6(a)(1)(B) supports this distinction.&para;<br>What is a State to do if it has reason to doubt an applicant’s eligibility but cannot be sure that the applicant is&para;<br>ineligible? Must the State either grant or deny registration without communicating with the applicant? Or does&para;<br>the Court believe that a State may ask for additional&para;<br>information in individual cases but may not impose a&para;<br>categorical requirement for all applicants? If that is the&para;<br>Court’s position, on which provision of the NVRA does it&para;<br>rely? The Court’s reading of §1973gg–6(a)(1)(B) is atextual and makes little sense.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>Properly interpreted, the NVRA permits Arizona to&para;<br>require applicants for federal voter registration to provide&para;<br>proof of eligibility. I therefore respectfully dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
