SYMCZYK&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–1059. Argued December 3, 2012—Decided April 16, 2013&para;<br>Respondent brought a collective action under the Fair Labor Standards&para;<br>Act of 1938 (FLSA) on behalf of herself and “other employees similarly situated.” 29 U. S. C. §216(b). After she ignored petitioners’ offer&para;<br>of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, the District&para;<br>Court, finding that no other individuals had joined her suit and that&para;<br>the Rule 68 offer fully satisfied her claim, concluded that respondent’s suit was moot and dismissed it for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The Third Circuit reversed. It held that respondent’s individual claim was moot but that her collective action was not,&para;<br>explaining that allowing defendants to “pick off” named plaintiffs before certification with calculated Rule 68 offers would frustrate the&para;<br>goals of collective actions. The case was remanded to the District&para;<br>Court to allow respondent to seek “conditional certification,” which, if&para;<br>successful, would relate back to the date of her complaint.&para;<br>Held: Because respondent had no personal interest in representing putative, unnamed claimants, nor any other continuing interest that&para;<br>would preserve her suit from mootness, her suit was appropriately&para;<br>dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Pp. 3–12.&para;<br>(a) While the Courts of Appeals disagree whether an unaccepted&para;<br>Rule 68 offer that fully satisfies a plaintiff’s individual claim is sufficient to render that claim moot, respondent conceded the issue below&para;<br>and did not properly raise it here. Thus, this Court assumes, without&para;<br>deciding, that petitioners’ offer mooted her individual claim. Pp. 3–5.&para;<br>(b) Well-settled mootness principles control the outcome of this&para;<br>case. After respondent’s individual claim became moot, the suit became moot because she had no personal interest in representing others in the action. To avoid that outcome, respondent relies on cases&para;<br>that arose in the context of Rule 23 class actions, but they are inap-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>posite, both because Rule 23 actions are fundamentally different from&para;<br>FLSA collective actions and because the cases are inapplicable to the&para;<br>facts here. Pp. 5–11.&para;<br>(1) Neither Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, nor United States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, support respondent’s position. Geraghty extended the principles of Sosna—which held that a&para;<br>class action is not rendered moot when the named plaintiff’s individual claim becomes moot after the class has been duly certified—to&para;<br>denials of class certification motions; and it provided that, where an&para;<br>action would have acquired independent legal status but for the district court’s erroneous denial of class certification, a corrected ruling&para;<br>on appeal “relates back” to the time of the erroneous denial. 445&para;<br>U. S., at 404, and n. 11. However, Geraghty’s holding was explicitly&para;<br>limited to cases in which the named plaintiff ’s claim remains live at&para;<br>the time the district court denies class certification. See id., at 407,&para;<br>n. 11. Here, respondent had not yet moved for “conditional certification” when her claim became moot, nor had the District Court anticipatorily ruled on any such request. She thus has no certification decision to which her claim could have related back.&para;<br>More&para;<br>fundamentally, essential to Sosna and Geraghty was the fact that a&para;<br>putative class acquires an independent legal status once it is certified&para;<br>under Rule 23. By contrast, under the FLSA, “conditional certification” does not produce a class with an independent legal status, or&para;<br>join additional parties to the action. Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(2) A line of cases holding that an “inherently transitory” classaction claim is not necessarily moot upon the termination of the&para;<br>named plaintiff’s claim, see, e.g., County of Riverside v. McLaughlin,&para;<br>500 U. S. 44, 52, is similarly inapplicable. Respondent argues that a&para;<br>defendant’s use of Rule 68 offers to “pick off” a named plaintiff before&para;<br>the collective-action process is complete renders the action “inherently transitory.” But this rationale was developed to address circumstances in which the challenged conduct was effectively unreviewable&para;<br>because no plaintiff possessed a personal stake in the suit long&para;<br>enough for litigation to run its course, and it has invariably focused&para;<br>on the fleeting nature of the challenged conduct giving rise to the&para;<br>claim, not on the defendant’s litigation strategy. Unlike a claim for&para;<br>injunctive relief, a damages claim cannot evade review, nor can an offer of full settlement insulate such a claim from review. Putative&para;<br>plaintiffs may be foreclosed from vindicating their rights in respondent’s suit, but they remain free to do so in their own suits. Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(3) Finally, Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U. S. 326,&para;<br>does not support respondent’s claim that the purposes served by the&para;<br>FLSA’s collective-action provisions would be frustrated by defendants’ use of Rule 68 to “pick off” named plaintiffs before the collective-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>action process has run its course. In Roper, where the named plaintiffs’ individual claims became moot after the District Court denied&para;<br>their Rule 23 class certification motion and entered judgment in their&para;<br>favor based on defendant’s offer of judgment, this Court found that&para;<br>the named plaintiffs could appeal the denial of certification because&para;<br>they possessed an ongoing, personal economic stake in the substantive controversy, namely, to shift a portion of attorney’s fees and expenses to successful class litigants. Here, respondent conceded that&para;<br>petitioners’ offer provided complete relief, and she asserted no continuing economic interest in shifting attorney’s fees and costs. Moreover, Roper was tethered to the unique significance of Rule 23 class&para;<br>certification decisions.

We granted certiorari to resolve whether such&para;<br>a case is justiciable when the lone plaintiff ’s individual&para;<br>claim becomes moot. 567 U. S. ___ (2012). We hold that it&para;<br>is not justiciable.&para;<br>I&para;<br>The FLSA establishes federal minimum-wage, maximumhour, and overtime guarantees that cannot be modified&para;<br>by contract. Section 16(b) of the FLSA, 52 Stat. 1060, as&para;<br>amended, 29 U. S. C. §216(b), gives employees the right&para;<br>to bring a private cause of action on their own behalf and&para;<br>on behalf of “other employees similarly situated” for specified violations of the FLSA. A suit brought on behalf of&para;<br>other employees is known as a “collective action.” See&para;<br>Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. v. Sperling, 493 U. S. 165, 169–&para;<br>170 (1989).&para;<br>In 2009, respondent, who was formerly employed by&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>petitioners as a registered nurse at Pennypack Center in&para;<br>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, filed a complaint on behalf of&para;<br>herself and “all other persons similarly situated.” App.&para;<br>115–116. Respondent alleged that petitioners violated the&para;<br>FLSA by automatically deducting 30 minutes of time&para;<br>worked per shift for meal breaks for certain employees,&para;<br>even when the employees performed compensable work&para;<br>during those breaks. Respondent, who remained the sole&para;<br>plaintiff throughout these proceedings, sought statutory&para;<br>damages for the alleged violations.&para;<br>When petitioners answered the complaint, they simultaneously served upon respondent an offer of judgment&para;<br>under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68. The offer included $7,500 for alleged unpaid wages, in addition to&para;<br>“such reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses . . .&para;<br>as the Court may determine.” Id., at 77. Petitioners stipulated that if respondent did not accept the offer&para;<br>within 10 days after service, the offer would be deemed&para;<br>withdrawn.&para;<br>After respondent failed to respond in the allotted time&para;<br>period, petitioners filed a motion to dismiss for lack of&para;<br>subject-matter jurisdiction. Petitioners argued that because they offered respondent complete relief on her individual damages claim, she no longer possessed a personal&para;<br>stake in the outcome of the suit, rendering the action&para;<br>moot. Respondent objected, arguing that petitioners were&para;<br>inappropriately attempting to “pick off ” the named plaintiff before the collective-action process could unfold. Id., at&para;<br>91.&para;<br>The District Court found that it was undisputed that no&para;<br>other individuals had joined respondent’s suit and that the&para;<br>Rule 68 offer of judgment fully satisfied her individual&para;<br>claim. It concluded that petitioners’ Rule 68 offer of judgment mooted respondent’s suit, which it dismissed for lack&para;<br>of subject-matter jurisdiction.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals reversed. 656 F. 3d 189 (CA3&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>2011). The court agreed that no other potential plaintiff&para;<br>had opted into the suit, that petitioners’ offer fully satisfied respondent’s individual claim, and that, under its&para;<br>precedents, whether or not such an offer is accepted, it&para;<br>generally moots a plaintiff ’s claim. Id., at 195. But the&para;<br>court nevertheless held that respondent’s collective action&para;<br>was not moot. It explained that calculated attempts by&para;<br>some defendants to “pick off ” named plaintiffs with strategic Rule 68 offers before certification could short circuit&para;<br>the process, and, thereby, frustrate the goals of collective&para;<br>actions. Id., at 196–198. The court determined that the&para;<br>case must be remanded in order to allow respondent to&para;<br>seek “conditional certification”1 in the District Court. If&para;<br>respondent were successful, the District Court was to&para;<br>relate the certification motion back to the date on which&para;<br>respondent filed her complaint.2 Ibid.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Article III, §2, of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction&para;<br>of federal courts to “Cases” and “Controversies,” which&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Lower&para;<br>&para;<br>courts have borrowed class-action terminology to describe the&para;<br>process of joining co-plaintiffs under 29 U. S. C. §216(b). While we do&para;<br>not express an opinion on the propriety of this use of class-action&para;<br>nomenclature, we do note that there are significant differences between&para;<br>certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and the joinder&para;<br>process under §216(b).&para;<br>2 The “relation back” doctrine was developed in the context of class&para;<br>actions under Rule 23 to address the circumstance in which a named&para;<br>plaintiff’s claim becomes moot prior to certification of the class. This&para;<br>case raises two circumstances in which the Court has applied this&para;<br>doctrine. First, where a named plaintiff’s claim is “inherently transitory,” and becomes moot prior to certification, a motion for certification&para;<br>may “relate back” to the filing of the complaint. See, e.g., County of&para;<br>Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 51–52 (1991). Second, we have&para;<br>held that where a certification motion is denied and a named plaintiff’s&para;<br>claim subsequently becomes moot, an appellate reversal of the certification decision may relate back to the time of the denial. See United&para;<br>States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 404 (1980).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>restricts the authority of federal courts to resolving “ ‘the&para;<br>legal rights of litigants in actual controversies,’ ” Valley&para;<br>Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 471 (1982)&para;<br>(quoting Liverpool, New York &amp; Philadelphia S. S. Co. v.&para;<br>Commissioners of Emigration, 113 U. S. 33, 39 (1885)). In&para;<br>order to invoke federal-court jurisdiction, a plaintiff must&para;<br>demonstrate that he possesses a legally cognizable interest, or “ ‘personal stake,’ ” in the outcome of the action. See&para;<br>Camreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5)&para;<br>(quoting Summers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U. S. 488,&para;<br>493 (2009)). This requirement ensures that the Federal&para;<br>Judiciary confines itself to its constitutionally limited role&para;<br>of adjudicating actual and concrete disputes, the resolutions of which have direct consequences on the parties&para;<br>involved.&para;<br>A corollary to this case-or-controversy requirement is&para;<br>that “ ‘an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of&para;<br>review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.’ ”&para;<br>Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 67&para;<br>(1997) (quoting Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U. S. 395, 401&para;<br>(1975)). If an intervening circumstance deprives the&para;<br>plaintiff of a “personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit,” at any point during litigation, the action can no&para;<br>longer proceed and must be dismissed as moot. Lewis v.&para;<br>Continental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472, 477–478 (1990)&para;<br>(internal quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>In the proceedings below, both courts concluded that&para;<br>petitioners’ Rule 68 offer afforded respondent complete&para;<br>relief on—and thus mooted—her FLSA claim. See 656&para;<br>F. 3d, at 201; No. 09–5782, 2010 WL 2038676, *4 (ED Pa.,&para;<br>May 19, 2010). Respondent now contends that these&para;<br>rulings were erroneous, because petitioners’ Rule 68 offer&para;<br>lapsed without entry of judgment. Brief for Respondent&para;<br>12–16. The United States, as amicus curiae, similarly&para;<br>urges the Court to hold that petitioners’ unaccepted offer&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>did not moot her FLSA claim and to affirm the Court of&para;<br>Appeals on this basis. Brief for United States 10–15.&para;<br>While the Courts of Appeals disagree whether an unaccepted offer that fully satisfies a plaintiff ’s claim is&para;<br>sufficient to render the claim moot,3 we do not reach this&para;<br>question, or resolve the split, because the issue is not&para;<br>properly before us. The Third Circuit clearly held in this&para;<br>case that respondent’s individual claim was moot. 656&para;<br>F. 3d, at 201. Acceptance of respondent’s argument to the&para;<br>contrary now would alter the Court of Appeals’ judgment,&para;<br>which is impermissible in the absence of a cross-petition&para;<br>from respondent. See Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. County of&para;<br>Kent, 510 U. S. 355, 364 (1994); Trans World Airlines, Inc.&para;<br>v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 119, n. 14 (1985). Moreover,&para;<br>even if the cross-petition rule did not apply, respondent’s&para;<br>waiver of the issue would still prevent us from reaching it.&para;<br>In the District Court, respondent conceded that “[a]n offer&para;<br>of complete relief will generally moot the [plaintiff ’s]&para;<br>claim, as at that point the plaintiff retains no personal&para;<br>interest in the outcome of the litigation.” App. 93; 2010&para;<br>WL 2038676, at *4. Respondent made a similar concession in her brief to the Court of Appeals, see App. 193, and&para;<br>failed to raise the argument in her brief in opposition to&para;<br>the petition for certiorari. We, therefore, assume, without&para;<br>deciding, that petitioners’ Rule 68 offer mooted respondent’s individual claim. See Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U. S. 27,&para;<br>34 (2004).&para;<br>III&para;<br>We turn, then, to the question whether respondent’s&para;<br>action remained justiciable based on the collective-action&para;<br>allegations in her complaint. A straightforward application of well-settled mootness principles compels our an——————&para;<br>3 Compare, e.g., Weiss v. Regal Collections, 385 F. 3d 337, 340 (CA3&para;<br>2004), with McCauley v. Trans Union, LLC, 402 F. 3d 340, 342 (CA2&para;<br>2005).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>swer. In the absence of any claimant’s opting in, respondent’s suit became moot when her individual claim became&para;<br>moot, because she lacked any personal interest in representing others in this action. While the FLSA authorizes&para;<br>an aggrieved employee to bring an action on behalf of&para;<br>himself and “other employees similarly situated,” 29&para;<br>U. S. C. §216(b), the mere presence of collective-action&para;<br>allegations in the complaint cannot save the suit from&para;<br>mootness once the individual claim is satisfied.4 In order&para;<br>to avoid this outcome, respondent relies almost entirely&para;<br>upon cases that arose in the context of Federal Rule of&para;<br>Civil Procedure 23 class actions, particularly United&para;<br>States Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388 (1980);&para;<br>Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U. S. 326&para;<br>(1980); and Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393 (1975). But these&para;<br>cases are inapposite, both because Rule 23 actions are&para;<br>fundamentally different from collective actions under the&para;<br>FLSA, see Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., 493 U. S., at 177–178&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., dissenting), and because these cases are, by&para;<br>their own terms, inapplicable to these facts. It follows&para;<br>that this action was appropriately dismissed as moot.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 While we do not resolve the question whether a Rule 68 offer that&para;<br>fully satisfies the plaintiff’s claims is sufficient by itself to moot the&para;<br>action, supra, at 5, we note that Courts of Appeals on both sides of that&para;<br>issue have recognized that a plaintiff’s claim may be satisfied even&para;<br>without the plaintiff’s consent. Some courts maintain that an unaccepted offer of complete relief alone is sufficient to moot the individual’s&para;<br>claim. E.g., Weiss, supra, at 340; Greisz v. Household Bank (Ill.), N. A.,&para;<br>176 F. 3d 1012, 1015 (CA7 1999). Other courts have held that, in the&para;<br>face of an unaccepted offer of complete relief, district courts may “enter&para;<br>judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in accordance with the defendants’&para;<br>Rule 68 offer of judgment.” O’Brien v. Ed Donnelly Enters., Inc., 575&para;<br>F. 3d 567, 575 (CA6 2009); see also McCauley v. Trans Union, LLC, 402&para;<br>F. 3d 340, 342 (CA2 2005). Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, see post,&para;<br>at 8 (opinion of Kagan, J.), nothing in the nature of FLSA actions&para;<br>precludes satisfaction—and thus the mooting—of the individual’s claim&para;<br>before the collective-action component of the suit has run its course.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent contends that she has a sufficient personal&para;<br>stake in this case based on a statutorily created collectiveaction interest in representing other similarly situated&para;<br>employees under §216(b). Brief for Respondent 47–48. In&para;<br>support of her argument, respondent cites our decision in&para;<br>Geraghty, which in turn has its roots in Sosna. Neither&para;<br>case supports her position.&para;<br>In Sosna, the Court held that a class action is not rendered moot when the named plaintiff ’s individual claim&para;<br>becomes moot after the class has been duly certified. 419&para;<br>U. S., at 399. The Court reasoned that when a district&para;<br>court certifies a class, “the class of unnamed persons&para;<br>described in the certification acquire[s] a legal status&para;<br>separate from the interest asserted by [the named plaintiff],” with the result that a live controversy may continue&para;<br>to exist, even after the claim of the named plaintiff becomes moot. Id., at 399–402. Geraghty narrowly extended&para;<br>this principle to denials of class certification motions. The&para;<br>Court held that where an action would have acquired the&para;<br>independent legal status described in Sosna but for the&para;<br>district court’s erroneous denial of class certification, a&para;<br>corrected ruling on appeal “relates back” to the time of the&para;<br>erroneous denial of the certification motion. 445 U. S., at&para;<br>404, and n. 11.&para;<br>Geraghty is inapposite, because the Court explicitly&para;<br>limited its holding to cases in which the named plaintiff ’s&para;<br>claim remains live at the time the district court denies&para;<br>class certification. See id., at 407, n. 11. Here, respondent&para;<br>had not yet moved for “conditional certification” when her&para;<br>claim became moot, nor had the District Court anticipatorily ruled on any such request. Her claim instead became&para;<br>moot prior to these events, foreclosing any recourse to&para;<br>Geraghty. There is simply no certification decision to&para;<br>which respondent’s claim could have related back.&para;<br>More fundamentally, essential to our decisions in Sosna&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>and Geraghty was the fact that a putative class acquires&para;<br>an independent legal status once it is certified under Rule&para;<br>23. Under the FLSA, by contrast, “conditional certification” does not produce a class with an independent legal&para;<br>status, or join additional parties to the action. The sole&para;<br>consequence of conditional certification is the sending of&para;<br>court-approved written notice to employees, see HoffmannLa Roche Inc., supra, at 171–172, who in turn become&para;<br>parties to a collective action only by filing written consent with the court, §216(b). So even if respondent were&para;<br>to secure a conditional certification ruling on remand,&para;<br>nothing in that ruling would preserve her suit from&para;<br>mootness.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Respondent also advances an argument based on a&para;<br>separate, but related, line of cases in which the Court held&para;<br>that an “inherently transitory” class-action claim is not&para;<br>necessarily moot upon the termination of the named plaintiff ’s claim. Like our decision in Geraghty, this line of&para;<br>cases began with Sosna and is similarly inapplicable here.&para;<br>After concluding that the expiration of a named plaintiff ’s claim following certification does not moot the class&para;<br>action, Sosna suggested that, where a named plaintiff’s&para;<br>individual claim becomes moot before the district court&para;<br>has an opportunity to rule on the certification motion, and&para;<br>the issue would otherwise evade review, the certification&para;<br>might “relate back” to the filing of the complaint. 419&para;<br>U. S., at 402, n. 11. The Court has since held that the&para;<br>relation-back doctrine may apply in Rule 23 cases where it&para;<br>is “certain that other persons similarly situated” will&para;<br>continue to be subject to the challenged conduct and the&para;<br>claims raised are “ ‘so inherently transitory that the trial&para;<br>court will not have even enough time to rule on a motion&para;<br>for class certification before the proposed representative’s&para;<br>individual interest expires.’ ”&para;<br>County of Riverside v.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

Invoking this doctrine, respondent&para;<br>argues that defendants can strategically use Rule 68 offers&para;<br>to “pick off ” named plaintiffs before the collective-action&para;<br>process is complete, rendering collective actions “inherently transitory” in effect. Brief for Respondent 37.&para;<br>Our cases invoking the “inherently transitory” relationback rationale do not apply. The “inherently transitory”&para;<br>rationale was developed to address circumstances in which&para;<br>the challenged conduct was effectively unreviewable,&para;<br>because no plaintiff possessed a personal stake in the suit&para;<br>long enough for litigation to run its course. A plaintiff&para;<br>might seek, for instance, to bring a class action challenging the constitutionality of temporary pretrial detentions.&para;<br>In doing so, the named plaintiff would face the considerable challenge of preserving his individual claim from&para;<br>mootness, since pretrial custody likely would end prior to&para;<br>the resolution of his claim. See Gerstein, supra. To address this problem, the Court explained that in cases&para;<br>where the transitory nature of the conduct giving rise to&para;<br>the suit would effectively insulate defendants’ conduct&para;<br>from review, certification could potentially “relate back” to&para;<br>the filing of the complaint. Id., at 110, n. 11; McLaughlin,&para;<br>supra, at 52. But this doctrine has invariably focused on&para;<br>the fleeting nature of the challenged conduct giving rise to&para;<br>the claim, not on the defendant’s litigation strategy. See,&para;<br>e.g., Swisher v. Brady, 438 U. S. 204, 214, n. 11 (1978);&para;<br>Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 17–18 (1998).&para;<br>In this case, respondent’s complaint requested statutory&para;<br>damages. Unlike claims for injunctive relief challenging&para;<br>ongoing conduct, a claim for damages cannot evade review; it remains live until it is settled, judicially resolved,&para;<br>or barred by a statute of limitations. Nor can a defendant’s attempt to obtain settlement insulate such a claim&para;<br>from review, for a full settlement offer addresses plaintiff ’s&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v.

While settlement may have the collateral effect of foreclosing unjoined claimants from having their rights vindicated in&para;<br>respondent’s suit, such putative plaintiffs remain free to&para;<br>vindicate their rights in their own suits.

Id., at&para;<br>329–330. The Court held that even though the District&para;<br>Court had entered judgment in the named plaintiffs’ favor,&para;<br>they could nevertheless appeal the denial of their motion&para;<br>to certify the class. The Court found that, under the particular circumstances of that case, the named plaintiffs&para;<br>possessed an ongoing, personal economic stake in the&para;<br>substantive controversy—namely, to shift a portion of&para;<br>attorney’s fees and expenses to successful class litigants.5&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Because Roper is distinguishable on the facts, we need not consider&para;<br>its continuing validity in light of our subsequent decision in Lewis v.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

The issue here, the majority tells us, is&para;<br>whether a “ ‘ collective action’ ” brought under the Fair&para;<br>Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29 U. S. C. §201&para;<br>et seq., “is justiciable when the lone plaintiff’s individual&para;<br>claim becomes moot.” Ante, at 1. Embedded within that&para;<br>question is a crucial premise: that the individual claim has&para;<br>become moot, as the lower courts held and the majority&para;<br>assumes without deciding. But what if that premise is&para;<br>bogus? What if the plaintiff’s individual claim here never&para;<br>became moot? And what if, in addition, no similar claim&para;<br>for damages will ever become moot? In that event, the&para;<br>majority’s decision—founded as it is on an unfounded&para;<br>assumption—would have no real-world meaning or appli­&para;<br>cation. The decision would turn out to be the most one-off&para;<br>of one-offs, explaining only what (the majority thinks)&para;<br>should happen to a proposed collective FLSA action when&para;<br>something that in fact never happens to an individual&para;<br>FLSA claim is errantly thought to have done so. That is&para;<br>the case here, for reasons I’ll describe. Feel free to rele­&para;<br>gate the majority’s decision to the furthest reaches of your&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>mind: The situation it addresses should never again arise.&para;<br>Consider the facts of this case, keeping an eye out for&para;<br>anything that would render any part of it moot. Respond­&para;<br>ent Laura Symczyk brought suit under a provision of the&para;<br>FLSA, 29 U. S. C. §216(b), “on behalf of herself and others&para;<br>similarly situated.” App. 21. Her complaint alleged&para;<br>that her former employer, petitioner Genesis Healthcare&para;<br>Corporation (Genesis), violated the FLSA by treating&para;<br>30 minutes of every shift as an unpaid meal break, even&para;<br>when an employee worked during that time. Genesis&para;<br>answered the complaint and simultaneously made an offer&para;<br>of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68.&para;<br>That settlement proposal covered only Symczyk’s individ­&para;<br>ual claim, to the tune of $7,500 in lost wages. The offer,&para;<br>according to its terms, would “be deemed withdrawn” if&para;<br>Symczyk did not accept it within 10 days. App. 79. That&para;<br>deadline came and went without any reply. The case then&para;<br>proceeded in the normal fashion, with the District Court&para;<br>setting a schedule for discovery. Pause here for a moment&para;<br>to ask whether you’ve seen anything yet that would moot&para;<br>Symczyk’s individual claim. No? Neither have I.&para;<br>Nevertheless, Genesis moved to dismiss Symczyk’s suit&para;<br>on the ground that it was moot. The supposed logic went&para;<br>like this: We (i.e., Genesis) offered Symczyk complete relief&para;<br>on her individual damages claim; she “effectively reject[ed]&para;<br>the [o]ffer” by failing to respond; because she did so, she&para;<br>“no longer has a personal stake or legally cognizable inter­&para;<br>est in the outcome of this action”; accordingly, the court&para;<br>“should dismiss her claims.” Id., at 67. Relying on Circuit&para;<br>precedent, the District Court agreed; it dismissed the case&para;<br>for lack of jurisdiction—without awarding Symczyk any&para;<br>damages or other relief—based solely on the unaccepted&para;<br>offer Genesis had made. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 35&para;<br>(citing Weiss v. Regal Collections, 385 F. 3d 337, 340 (CA3&para;<br>2004)). And finally, the Court of Appeals for the Third&para;<br>Circuit concurred that Genesis’s offer mooted Symczyk’s&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>individual claim (though also holding that she could still&para;<br>proceed with a collective action). See 656 F. 3d 189 (2011).&para;<br>That thrice-asserted view is wrong, wrong, and wrong&para;<br>again. We made clear earlier this Term that “[a]s long as&para;<br>the parties have a concrete interest, however small, in the&para;<br>outcome of the litigation, the case is not moot.” Chafin v.&para;<br>Chafin, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). “[A] case becomes moot only&para;<br>when it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual&para;<br>relief whatever to the prevailing party.” Ibid. (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). By those measures, an unac­&para;<br>cepted offer of judgment cannot moot a case. When a&para;<br>plaintiff rejects such an offer—however good the terms—&para;<br>her interest in the lawsuit remains just what it was be­&para;<br>fore. And so too does the court’s ability to grant her relief.&para;<br>An unaccepted settlement offer—like any unaccepted&para;<br>contract offer—is a legal nullity, with no operative effect.&para;<br>As every first-year law student learns, the recipient’s rejection of an offer “leaves the matter as if no offer had&para;<br>ever been made.” Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis R. Co. v. Columbus Rolling Mill, 119 U. S. 149, 151 (1886). Nothing&para;<br>in Rule 68 alters that basic principle; to the contrary, that&para;<br>rule specifies that “[a]n unaccepted offer is considered&para;<br>withdrawn.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 68(b). So assuming the&para;<br>case was live before—because the plaintiff had a stake and&para;<br>the court could grant relief—the litigation carries on,&para;<br>unmooted.&para;<br>For this reason, Symczyk’s individual claim was alive&para;<br>and well when the District Court dismissed her suit.&para;<br>Recall: Genesis made a settlement offer under Rule 68;&para;<br>Symczyk decided not to accept it; after 10 days, it expired&para;<br>and the suit went forward. Symczyk’s individual stake in&para;<br>the lawsuit thus remained what it had always been, and&para;<br>ditto the court’s capacity to grant her relief. After the&para;<br>offer lapsed, just as before, Symczyk possessed an unsatis­&para;<br>fied claim, which the court could redress by awarding her&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>damages. As long as that remained true, Symczyk’s claim&para;<br>was not moot, and the District Court could not send her&para;<br>away empty-handed. So a friendly suggestion to the Third&para;<br>Circuit: Rethink your mootness-by-unaccepted-offer theo­&para;<br>ry. And a note to all other courts of appeals: Don’t try this&para;<br>at home.&para;<br>To this point, what I have said conflicts with nothing in&para;<br>the Court’s opinion. The majority does not attempt to&para;<br>argue, à la the Third Circuit, that the unaccepted settle­&para;<br>ment offer mooted Symczyk’s individual damages claim.&para;<br>Instead, the majority hangs its hat on a finding of waiver.&para;<br>See ante, at 5, 11. The majority notes—correctly—that&para;<br>Symczyk accepted the Third Circuit’s rule in her briefs&para;<br>below, and also failed to challenge it in her brief in opposi­&para;<br>tion to the petition for certiorari; she contested it first in&para;<br>her merits brief before this Court. That enables the ma­&para;<br>jority to “assume, without deciding,” the mootness of&para;<br>Symczyk’s individual claim and reach the oh-so-much­&para;<br>more-interesting question relating to her proposed collec­&para;<br>tive action. Ante, at 5.1&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The majority also justifies this approach on the ground that&para;<br>Symczyk did not file a cross-petition for certiorari objecting to the Third&para;<br>Circuit’s decision. But that is because Symczyk got the judgment she&para;<br>wanted in the Third Circuit. As the majority agrees, a cross-petition is&para;<br>necessary only when a respondent seeks to “alter” the judgment below.&para;<br>Ante, at 5; see E. Gressman, K. Geller, S. Shapiro, T. Bishop, &amp; E.&para;<br>Hartnett, Supreme Court Practice 490 (9th ed. 2007) (“[A] party satis­&para;<br>fied with the action of a lower court should not have to appeal from it in&para;<br>order to defend a judgment in his or her favor on any ground”). Here,&para;<br>the Third Circuit reversed the District Court’s dismissal of Sym­&para;<br>czyk’s FLSA suit, ruling that her collective action could go forward&para;<br>even though her individual claim was moot; accordingly, accepting&para;<br>Symczyk’s new argument would lead not to modifying the appellate&para;<br>judgment, but to affirming it on a different ground. In any event, we&para;<br>have never held that the cross-petition requirement is jurisdictional.&para;<br>See id., at 493–494. We can choose to excuse the absence of a cross­&para;<br>petition for the same reasons, discussed next, that we can consider an&para;<br>issue not raised below. See Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U. S. 252, 258–259,&para;<br>n. 5 (1980).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>But as this Court noted in a similar case, “assum[ing]&para;<br>what the facts will show to be ridiculous” about a predi­&para;<br>cate question—just because a party did not think to chal­&para;<br>lenge settled Circuit precedent—runs “a risk that ought&para;<br>to be avoided.” Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger&para;<br>Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 382 (1995). The question&para;<br>Symczyk now raises (“Did an unaccepted settlement offer&para;<br>moot my individual FLSA claim?”) is logically prior to—&para;<br>and thus inextricably intertwined with—the question the&para;<br>majority rushes to resolve (“If an unaccepted settlement&para;<br>offer mooted Symczyk’s individual FLSA claim, could a&para;<br>court proceed to consider her proposed collective action?”).&para;<br>Indeed, the former is so much part and parcel of the latter&para;<br>that the question Genesis presented for our review—&para;<br>and on which we granted certiorari—actually looks more&para;<br>like Symczyk’s than like the majority’s. Genesis asked:&para;<br>“Whether a case becomes moot . . . when the lone plaintiff&para;<br>receives an offer from the defendants to satisfy all of the&para;<br>plaintiff’s claims.” Pet. for Cert. i. Symczyk, of course,&para;<br>would respond “no,” because merely receiving an offer does&para;<br>not moot any claim. The majority’s refusal to consider&para;<br>that obviously correct answer impedes “intelligent resolu­&para;<br>tion of the question presented.” Ohio v. Robinette, 519&para;<br>U. S. 33, 38 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). By&para;<br>taking a fallacy as its premise, the majority ensures it will&para;<br>reach the wrong decision.&para;<br>Still, you might think, the majority’s approach has at&para;<br>least this benefit: In a future FLSA case, when an individ­&para;<br>ual claim for damages in fact becomes moot, a court will&para;<br>know what to do with the collective allegations. But no,&para;<br>even that much cannot be said for the majority’s opinion.&para;<br>That is because the individual claims in such cases will&para;<br>never become moot, and a court will therefore never need&para;<br>to reach the issue the majority resolves. The majority’s&para;<br>decision is fit for nothing: Aside from getting this case&para;<br>wrong, it serves only to address a make-believe problem.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>To see why, consider how a collective FLSA action seek­&para;<br>ing damages unfolds. A plaintiff (just like Symczyk, but&para;<br>let us now call her Smith, to highlight her typicality) sues&para;<br>under §216(b) on behalf of both herself and others. To&para;<br>determine whether Smith can serve as a representative&para;<br>party, the court considers whether the workplace policy&para;<br>her suit challenges has similarly affected other employees.&para;<br>If it has, the court supervises their discovery and notifica­&para;<br>tion, and then “oversee[s] the joinder” of any who want&para;<br>Smith to represent them. Hoffman La-Roche Inc. v. Sperling, 493 U. S. 165, 171 (1989). During that period, as&para;<br>the majority observes, the class has no “independent legal&para;<br>status.” Ante, at 7. At the same time, Smith’s own claim&para;<br>is in perfect health. Because it is a damages claim for past&para;<br>conduct, the employer cannot extinguish it by adopting&para;<br>new employment practices. Indeed, the claim would sur­&para;<br>vive even Smith’s own demise, belonging then to her es­&para;<br>tate. Smith’s individual claim, in short, is not going away&para;<br>on its own; it can easily wait out the time involved in&para;<br>assembling a collective action. Accord, ante, at 9 (“[A]&para;<br>claim for damages cannot evade review; it remains live&para;<br>until it is settled [or] judicially resolved”).&para;<br>Now introduce a settlement offer into the picture: As­&para;<br>sume that before the court finally decides whether to&para;<br>permit a collective action, the defendant proposes to pay&para;<br>Smith the value of her individual claim in exchange for&para;<br>her abandonment of the entire litigation. If Smith agrees,&para;<br>of course, all is over; like any plaintiff, she can assent to&para;<br>a settlement ending her suit. But assuming Smith does&para;<br>not agree, because she wishes to proceed on behalf of other&para;<br>employees, could the offer ever succeed in mooting her&para;<br>case? I have already shown that it cannot do so in the&para;<br>circumstances here, where the defendant makes an offer,&para;<br>the plaintiff declines it, and nothing else occurs: On those&para;<br>facts, Smith’s claim is as it ever was, and the lawsuit&para;<br>continues onward. But suppose the defendant addition­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ally requests that the court enter judgment in Smith’s&para;<br>favor—though over her objection—for the amount offered&para;<br>to satisfy her individual claim. Could a court approve that&para;<br>motion and then declare the case over on the ground that&para;<br>Smith has no further stake in it? That course would be&para;<br>less preposterous than what the court did here; at least&para;<br>Smith, unlike Symczyk, would get some money. But it&para;<br>would be impermissible as well.&para;<br>For starters, Rule 68 precludes a court from imposing&para;<br>judgment for a plaintiff like Smith based on an unaccepted&para;<br>settlement offer made pursuant to its terms. The text of&para;<br>the Rule contemplates that a court will enter judgment&para;<br>only when a plaintiff accepts an offer. See Rule 68(a) (“If&para;<br>. . . the [plaintiff] serves written notice accepting the offer, either party may then file the offer and notice of ac­&para;<br>ceptance, plus proof of service. The clerk must then enter&para;<br>judgment”). And the Rule prohibits a court from consider­&para;<br>ing an unaccepted offer for any purpose other than allocat­&para;<br>ing litigation costs—including for the purpose of entering&para;<br>judgment for either party. See Rule 68(b) (“Evidence of an&para;<br>unaccepted offer is not admissible except in a proceeding&para;<br>to determine costs”). That injunction accords with Rule&para;<br>68’s exclusive purpose: to promote voluntary cessation of&para;<br>litigation by imposing costs on plaintiffs who spurn certain&para;<br>settlement offers. See Marek v. Chesny, 473 U. S. 1, 5&para;<br>(1985). The Rule provides no appropriate mechanism for&para;<br>a court to terminate a lawsuit without the plaintiff’s&para;<br>consent.&para;<br>Nor does a court have inherent authority to enter an&para;<br>unwanted judgment for Smith on her individual claim, in&para;<br>service of wiping out her proposed collective action. To be&para;<br>sure, a court has discretion to halt a lawsuit by entering&para;<br>judgment for the plaintiff when the defendant uncondi­&para;<br>tionally surrenders and only the plaintiff’s obstinacy or&para;<br>madness prevents her from accepting total victory. But&para;<br>the court may not take that tack when the supposed ca­&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK&para;<br>KAGAN, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>pitulation in fact fails to give the plaintiff all the law&para;<br>authorizes and she has sought. And a judgment satisfying&para;<br>an individual claim does not give a plaintiff like Smith,&para;<br>exercising her right to sue on behalf of other employees,&para;<br>“all that [she] has . . . requested in the complaint (i.e.,&para;<br>relief for the class).” Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper,&para;<br>445 U. S. 326, 341 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., concurring).&para;<br>No more in a collective action brought under the FLSA&para;<br>than in any other class action may a court, prior to certifi­&para;<br>cation, eliminate the entire suit by acceding to a defend­&para;<br>ant’s proposal to make only the named plaintiff whole.&para;<br>That course would short-circuit a collective action before it&para;<br>could begin, and thereby frustrate Congress’s decision to give&para;<br>FLSA plaintiffs “the opportunity to proceed collectively.”&para;<br>Hoffman La-Roche, 493 U. S., at 170; see Roper, 445&para;<br>U. S., at 339. It is our plaintiff Smith’s choice, and not the&para;<br>defendant’s or the court’s, whether satisfaction of her&para;<br>individual claim, without redress of her viable classwide&para;<br>allegations, is sufficient to bring the lawsuit to an end.&para;<br>And so, the question the majority answers should never&para;<br>arise—which means the analysis the majority propounds&para;<br>should never apply.2 The majority assumes that an indi­&para;<br>vidual claim has become moot, and then asks whether&para;<br>collective allegations can still proceed by virtue of the&para;<br>relation-back doctrine. But that doctrine comes into play&para;<br>only when a court confronts a jurisdictional gap—an indi­&para;<br>vidual claim becoming moot before the court can certify a&para;<br>representative action. And in an FLSA case for damages,&para;<br>that gap cannot occur (unless a court, as here, mistakenly&para;<br>creates it): As I have explained, the plaintiff’s individual&para;<br>claim remains live all the way through the court’s decision&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 For&para;<br>&para;<br>similarly questionable deployment of this Court’s adjudicatory&para;<br>authority, see Comcast Corp. v.

If, counter-factually, Symczyk’s individual claim&para;<br>became moot when she failed to accept Genesis’s offer of judgment, her&para;<br>case would fit comfortably alongside those precedents. Because the&para;<br>District Court would not then have had “enough time to rule on a&para;<br>motion” for certification under §216(b), “the ‘relation back’ doctrine&para;<br>[would be] properly invoked to preserve the merits of the case for&para;<br>judicial resolution.” McLaughlin, 500 U. S., at 52 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted).&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
