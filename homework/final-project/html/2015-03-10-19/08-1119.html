Argued December 1, 2009—Decided March 8, 2010*&para;<br>The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of&para;<br>2005 (BAPCPA) amended the Bankruptcy Code to define a class of&para;<br>bankruptcy professionals termed “debt relief agenc[ies].” 11 U. S. C.&para;<br>§101(12A). That class includes, with limited exceptions, “any person&para;<br>who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person . . . for&para;<br>. . . payment . . . , or who is a bankruptcy petition preparer.” Ibid.&para;<br>The BAPCPA prohibits such professionals from “advis[ing] an as&para;<br>sisted person . . . to incur more debt in contemplation of [filing for&para;<br>bankruptcy] . . . .” §526(a)(4). It also requires them to disclose in&para;<br>their advertisements for certain services that the services are with&para;<br>respect to or may involve bankruptcy relief, §§528(a)(3), (b)(2)(A), and&para;<br>to identify themselves as debt relief agencies, §§528(a)(4), (b)(2)(B).&para;<br>The plaintiffs in this litigation—a law firm and others (collectively&para;<br>Milavetz)—filed a preenforcement suit seeking declaratory relief, ar&para;<br>guing that Milavetz is not bound by the BAPCPA’s debt-relief-agency&para;<br>provisions and therefore can freely advise clients to incur additional&para;<br>debt and need not make the requisite disclosures in its advertise&para;<br>ments. The District Court found that “debt relief agency” does not&para;<br>include attorneys and that §§526 and 528 are unconstitutional as ap&para;<br>plied to that class of professionals. The Eighth Circuit affirmed in&para;<br>part and reversed in part, rejecting the District Court’s conclusion&para;<br>that attorneys are not “debt relief agenc[ies]”; upholding application&para;<br>of §528’s disclosure requirements to attorneys; and finding §526(a)(4)&para;<br>unconstitutional because it broadly prohibits debt relief agencies&para;<br>——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 08–1225, United States v. Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Mi&para;<br>lavetz, P. A., et al., also on certiorari to the same court.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MILAVETZ, GALLOP &amp; MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>from advising assisted persons to incur any additional debt in con&para;<br>templation of bankruptcy even when the advice constitutes prudent&para;<br>prebankruptcy planning.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Attorneys who provide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons&para;<br>are debt relief agencies under the BAPCPA. By definition, “bank&para;<br>ruptcy assistance” includes several services commonly performed by&para;<br>attorneys, e.g., providing “advice, counsel, [or] document prepara&para;<br>tion,” §101(4A). Moreover, in enumerating specific exceptions to the&para;<br>debt-relief-agency definition, Congress indicated no intent to exclude&para;<br>attorneys. See §§101(12A)(A)–(E). Milavetz relies on the fact that&para;<br>§101(12A) does not expressly include attorneys in advocating a nar&para;<br>rower understanding. On that reading, only a bankruptcy petition&para;<br>preparer would qualify—an implausibility given that a “debt relief&para;<br>agency” is “any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance . . . or&para;<br>who is a bankruptcy petition preparer,” ibid. Milavetz’s other argu&para;<br>ments for excluding attorneys are also unpersuasive. Pp. 5–9.&para;<br>2. Section 526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency only from advis&para;<br>ing a debtor to incur more debt because the debtor is filing for bank&para;<br>ruptcy, rather than for a valid purpose. The statute’s language, to&para;<br>gether with its purpose, makes a narrow reading of §526(a)(4) the&para;<br>natural one. Conrad, Rubin &amp; Lesser v. Pender, 289 U. S. 472, sup&para;<br>ports this conclusion. The Court in that case read now-repealed&para;<br>§96(d), which authorized reexamination of a debtor’s attorney’s fees&para;<br>payment “in contemplation of the filing of a petition,” to require that&para;<br>the portended bankruptcy have “induce[d]” the transfer at issue, id.,&para;<br>at 477, understanding inducement to engender suspicion of abuse.&para;<br>The Court identified the “controlling question” as “whether the&para;<br>thought of bankruptcy was the impelling cause of the transaction,”&para;<br>ibid.&para;<br>Given the substantial similarities between §§96(d) and&para;<br>526(a)(4), the controlling question under the latter is likewise&para;<br>whether the impelling reason for “advis[ing] an assisted person . . . to&para;<br>incur more debt” was the prospect of filing for bankruptcy. In prac&para;<br>tice, advice impelled by the prospect of filing will generally consist of&para;<br>advice to “load up” on debt with the expectation of obtaining its dis&para;<br>charge.&para;<br>The statutory context supports the conclusion that&para;<br>§526(a)(4)’s prohibition primarily targets this type of conduct. The&para;<br>Court rejects Milavetz’s arguments for a more expansive view of&para;<br>§526(a)(4) and its claim that the provision, narrowly construed, is&para;<br>impermissibly vague. Pp. 9–18.&para;<br>3. Section 528’s disclosure requirements are valid as applied to Mi&para;<br>lavetz. Consistent with Milavetz’s characterization, the Court pre&para;<br>sumes that this is an as-applied challenge. Because §528 is directed&para;<br>at misleading commercial speech and imposes only a disclosure re&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>quirement rather than an affirmative limitation on speech, the less&para;<br>exacting scrutiny set out in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel&para;<br>of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, governs. There, the Court&para;<br>found that, while unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure re&para;<br>quirements offend the First Amendment, “an advertiser’s rights are&para;<br>adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasona&para;<br>bly related to the State’s interest in preventing deception of consum&para;<br>ers.” Id., at 651. Section 528’s requirements share the essential fea&para;<br>tures of the rule challenged in Zauderer. The disclosures are&para;<br>intended to combat the problem of inherently misleading commercial&para;<br>advertisements, and they entail only an accurate statement of the&para;<br>advertiser’s legal status and the character of the assistance provided.&para;<br>Moreover, they do not prevent debt relief agencies from conveying&para;<br>any additional information through their advertisements. In re R. M.&para;<br>J., 455 U. S. 191, distinguished. Because §528’s requirements are&para;<br>“reasonably related” to the Government’s interest in preventing con&para;<br>sumer deception, the Court upholds those provisions as applied to Mi&para;<br>lavetz.

See 11 U. S. C.&para;<br>§§101(3), (12A). These consolidated cases present the&para;<br>threshold question whether attorneys are debt relief agen&para;<br>cies when they provide qualifying services. Because we&para;<br>agree with the Court of Appeals that they are, we must&para;<br>also consider whether the Act’s provisions governing debt&para;<br>relief agencies’ advice to clients, §526(a)(4), and requiring&para;<br>them to make certain disclosures in their advertisements,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MILAVETZ, GALLOP &amp; MILAVETZ, P.

Concluding that the Court of Appeals con&para;<br>strued §526(a)(4) too expansively, we reverse its judgment&para;<br>that the provision is unconstitutionally overbroad. Like&para;<br>the Court of Appeals, we uphold §528’s disclosure re&para;<br>quirements as applied in these consolidated cases.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In order to improve bankruptcy law and practice, Con&para;<br>gress enacted through the BAPCPA a number of provi&para;<br>sions directed at the conduct of bankruptcy professionals.&para;<br>Some of these measures apply to the broad class of bank&para;<br>ruptcy professionals termed “debt relief agenc[ies].” That&para;<br>category includes, with limited exceptions, “any person&para;<br>who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted&para;<br>person in return for . . . payment . . . , or who is a bank&para;<br>ruptcy petition preparer.” §101(12A).1 “Bankruptcy assis&para;<br>tance” refers to goods or services “provided to an assisted&para;<br>person with the express or implied purpose of providing&para;<br>information, advice, counsel, document preparation, or&para;<br>filing, or attendance at a creditors’ meeting or appearing&para;<br>in a case or proceeding on behalf of another or providing&para;<br>legal representation with respect to a case or proceeding”&para;<br>in bankruptcy. §101(4A). An “assisted person” is someone&para;<br>with limited nonexempt property whose debts consist&para;<br>primarily of consumer debts. §101(3). The BAPCPA&para;<br>subjects debt relief agencies to a number of restrictions&para;<br>and requirements, as set forth in §§526, 527, and 528. As&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Congress excluded from the definition of “debt relief agency” any&para;<br>“officer, director, employee, or agent of a person who provides [bank&para;<br>ruptcy] assistance”; any “nonprofit organization that is exempt from&para;<br>taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986”;&para;<br>“a creditor of [an] assisted person” who is helping that person “to&para;<br>restructure any debt owed . . . to the creditor”; “a depository institu&para;<br>tion”; or “an author, publisher, distributor, or seller of works subject to&para;<br>copyright protection under title 17, when acting in such capacity.”&para;<br>§§101(12A)(A)–(E).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>relevant here, §526(a) establishes several rules of profes&para;<br>sional conduct for persons qualifying as debt relief agen&para;<br>cies. Among them, §526(a)(4) states that a debt relief&para;<br>agency shall not “advise an assisted person . . . to incur&para;<br>more debt in contemplation of such person filing a case&para;<br>under this title or to pay an attorney or bankruptcy peti&para;<br>tion preparer fee or charge for services performed as part&para;<br>of preparing for or representing a debtor in a case under&para;<br>this title.”&para;<br>Section 528 requires qualifying professionals to include&para;<br>certain disclosures in their advertisements. Subsection (a)&para;<br>provides that debt relief agencies must “clearly and con&para;<br>spicuously disclose in any advertisement of bankruptcy&para;<br>assistance services or of the benefits of bankruptcy di&para;<br>rected to the general public . . . that the services or bene&para;<br>fits are with respect to bankruptcy relief under this title.”&para;<br>§528(a)(3). It also requires them to include the following,&para;<br>“or a substantially similar statement”: “We are a debt&para;<br>relief agency. We help people file for bankruptcy relief&para;<br>under the Bankruptcy Code.” §528(a)(4). Subsection (b)&para;<br>requires essentially the same disclosures in advertise&para;<br>ments “indicating that the debt relief agency provides&para;<br>assistance with respect to credit defaults, mortgage fore&para;<br>closures, eviction proceedings, excessive debt, debt collec&para;<br>tion pressure, or inability to pay any consumer debt.”&para;<br>§528(b)(2). Debt relief agencies advertising such services&para;<br>must disclose “that the assistance may involve bankruptcy&para;<br>relief,” §528(b)(2)(A), and must identify themselves as&para;<br>“debt relief agenc[ies]” as required by §528(a)(4), see&para;<br>§528(b)(2)(B).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The plaintiffs in this litigation—the law firm Milavetz,&para;<br>Gallop &amp; Milavetz, P.

A. v.

Milavetz asked the court to&para;<br>hold that it is not bound by these provisions and thus may&para;<br>freely advise clients to incur additional debt and need not&para;<br>identify itself as a debt relief agency in its advertisements.&para;<br>Milavetz first argued that attorneys are not “debt relief&para;<br>agenc[ies]” as that term is used in the BAPCPA. In the&para;<br>alternative, Milavetz sought a judgment that §§526(a)(4)&para;<br>and 528(a)(4) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional as applied to&para;<br>attorneys. The District Court agreed with Milavetz that&para;<br>the term “debt relief agency” does not include attorneys,&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08–1119, p. A–15, but only&para;<br>after finding that §§526 and 528—provisions expressly&para;<br>applicable only to debt relief agencies—are unconstitu&para;<br>tional as applied to this class of professionals.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed in&para;<br>part and reversed in part. 541 F. 3d 785 (2008). Relying&para;<br>on the Act’s plain language, the court unanimously re&para;<br>jected the District Court’s conclusion that attorneys are&para;<br>not “debt relief agenc[ies]” within the meaning of the Act.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals also parted ways with the District&para;<br>Court concerning the constitutionality of §528. Conclud&para;<br>ing that the disclosures are intended to prevent consumer&para;<br>deception and are “reasonably related” to that interest, the&para;<br>court upheld the application of §528’s disclosure require&para;<br>ments to attorneys. Id., at 796–797 (citing Zauderer v.&para;<br>Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio,&para;<br>471 U. S. 626, 651 (1985)).&para;<br>A majority of the Eighth Circuit panel, however, agreed&para;<br>with the District Court that §526(a)(4) is invalid. Deter&para;<br>mining that §526(a)(4) “broadly prohibits a debt relief&para;<br>agency from advising an assisted person . . . to incur any&para;<br>additional debt when the assisted person is contemplating&para;<br>bankruptcy,” even when that advice constitutes prudent&para;<br>prebankruptcy planning not intended to abuse the bank&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ruptcy laws, 541 F. 3d, at 793, the majority held that&para;<br>§526(a)(4) could not withstand either strict or intermedi&para;<br>ate scrutiny. In dissent, Judge Colloton argued that&para;<br>§526(a)(4) should be read narrowly to prevent only advice&para;<br>to abuse the bankruptcy system, noting that this construc&para;<br>tion would avoid most constitutional difficulties. See id.,&para;<br>at 799 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).&para;<br>In light of a conflict among the Courts of Appeals,2 we&para;<br>granted certiorari to resolve the question of §526(a)(4)’s&para;<br>scope. 556 U. S. ___ (2009). We also agreed to consider&para;<br>the threshold question whether attorneys who provide&para;<br>bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are “debt relief&para;<br>agenc[ies]” within the meaning of §101(12A) and the re&para;<br>lated question whether §528’s disclosure requirements are&para;<br>constitutional.&para;<br>III &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>We first consider whether the term “debt relief agency”&para;<br>includes attorneys. If it does not, we need not reach the&para;<br>other questions presented, as §§526 and 528 govern only&para;<br>the conduct of debt relief agencies, and Milavetz chal&para;<br>lenges the validity of those provisions based on their&para;<br>application to attorneys. The Government contends that&para;<br>“debt relief agency” plainly includes attorneys, while&para;<br>Milavetz urges that it does not. We conclude that the&para;<br>Government has the better view.&para;<br>As already noted, a debt relief agency is “any person&para;<br>who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted&para;<br>person” in return for payment. §101(12A). By definition,&para;<br>“bankruptcy assistance” includes several services com&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Compare 541 F. 3d 785, 794 (CA8 2008) (case below), with Hersh v.&para;<br>United States ex rel.

A. v. UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>monly performed by attorneys. Indeed, some forms of&para;<br>bankruptcy assistance, including the “provi[sion of] legal&para;<br>representation with respect to a case or proceeding,”&para;<br>§101(4A), may be provided only by attorneys.&para;<br>See&para;<br>§110(e)(2) (prohibiting bankruptcy petition preparers from&para;<br>providing legal advice). Moreover, in enumerating specific&para;<br>exceptions to the definition of debt relief agency, Congress&para;<br>gave no indication that it intended to exclude attorneys.&para;<br>See §§101(12A)(A)–(E). Thus, as the Government con&para;<br>tends, the statutory text clearly indicates that attorneys&para;<br>are debt relief agencies when they provide qualifying&para;<br>services to assisted persons.3&para;<br>In advocating a narrower understanding of that term,&para;<br>Milavetz relies heavily on the fact that §101(12A) does not&para;<br>expressly include attorneys. That omission stands in&para;<br>contrast, it argues, to the provision’s explicit inclusion of&para;<br>“bankruptcy petition preparer[s]”—a category of profes&para;<br>sionals that excludes attorneys and their staff, see&para;<br>§110(a)(1). But Milavetz does not contend, nor could it&para;<br>credibly, that only professionals expressly included in the&para;<br>definition are debt relief agencies. On that reading, no&para;<br>professional other than a bankruptcy petition preparer&para;<br>would qualify—an implausible reading given that the&para;<br>statute defines “debt relief agency” as “any person who&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Although reliance on legislative history is unnecessary in light of&para;<br>the statute’s unambiguous language, we note the support that record&para;<br>provides for the Government’s reading. Statements in a Report of the&para;<br>House Committee on the Judiciary regarding the Act’s purpose indicate&para;<br>concern with abusive practices undertaken by attorneys as well as&para;<br>other bankruptcy professionals. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 109–31, pt. 1,&para;<br>p. 5 (2005) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.). And the legislative record else&para;<br>where documents misconduct by attorneys. See, e.g., Hearing on H.

III,&para;<br>p. 95 (1998) (hereinafter 1998 Hearings).

The provision’s silence regarding at&para;<br>torneys thus avails Milavetz little. Cf. Heintz v. Jenkins,&para;<br>514 U. S. 291, 294 (1995) (holding that “debt collector” as&para;<br>used in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U. S. C.&para;<br>§1692a(6), includes attorneys notwithstanding the defini&para;<br>tion’s lack of an express reference to lawyers or litigation).&para;<br>Milavetz’s other arguments for excluding attorneys&para;<br>similarly fail to persuade us to disregard the statute’s&para;<br>plain language.&para;<br>Milavetz contends that 11 U. S. C.&para;<br>§526(d)(2)’s instruction that §§526, 527, and 528 should&para;<br>not “be deemed to limit or curtail” States’ authority to&para;<br>“determine and enforce qualifications for the practice of&para;<br>law” counsels against reading “debt relief agency” to in&para;<br>clude attorneys, as the surest way to protect the States’&para;<br>role in regulating the legal profession is to make the&para;<br>BAPCPA’s professional conduct rules inapplicable to&para;<br>lawyers. We find that §526(d)(2) supports the opposite&para;<br>conclusion, as Congress would have had no reason to enact&para;<br>that provision if the debt-relief-agency provisions did not&para;<br>apply to attorneys. Milavetz’s broader claim that reading&para;<br>§101(12A) to include attorneys impermissibly trenches on&para;<br>an area of traditional state regulation also lacks merit.&para;<br>Congress and the bankruptcy courts have long overseen&para;<br>aspects of attorney conduct in this area of substantial&para;<br>federal concern. See, e.g., Conrad, Rubin &amp; Lesser v.&para;<br>Pender, 289 U. S. 472, 477–479 (1933) (finding broad&para;<br>authorization in former §96(d) (1934 ed.) (repealed 1978)&para;<br>for courts to examine the reasonableness of a debtor’s&para;<br>prepetition attorney’s fees).&para;<br>Milavetz next argues that §101(12A)’s exception for any&para;<br>“officer, director, employee, or agent of a person who pro&para;<br>vides” bankruptcy assistance is revealing for its failure to&para;<br>include “partners.” §101(12A)(A). In light of that omis&para;<br>sion, it contends, treating attorneys as debt relief agencies&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MILAVETZ, GALLOP &amp; MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>will obligate entire law firms to comply with §§526, 527,&para;<br>and 528 based on the conduct of a single partner, while&para;<br>the agents and employees of debt relief agencies not typi&para;<br>cally organized as partnerships are shielded from those&para;<br>requirements. Given that the partnership structure is not&para;<br>unique to law firms, however, it is unclear why the exclu&para;<br>sion would be revealing of Congress’ intent only with&para;<br>respect to attorneys. In any event, partnerships are them&para;<br>selves “person[s]” under the BAPCPA, see §101(41), and&para;<br>can qualify as “debt relief agenc[ies]” when they meet the&para;<br>criteria set forth in §101(12A). Moreover, a partnership’s&para;<br>employees and agents are exempted from §101(12A) in the&para;<br>same way as the employees and agents of other organiza&para;<br>tions. To the extent that partners may be subject to the&para;<br>debt-relief-agency provisions by association, that result is&para;<br>consistent with the joint responsibilities that typically flow&para;<br>from the partnership structure, cf. Strang v. Bradner, 114&para;<br>U. S. 555, 561 (1885). Accordingly, we decline to attribute&para;<br>the significance Milavetz suggests to §101(12A)(A)’s fail&para;<br>ure to include partners among the exempted actors.4&para;<br>All else failing, Milavetz urges that the canon of consti&para;<br>tutional avoidance requires us to read “debt relief agency”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Reviving an argument that Milavetz abandoned, amici contend that&para;<br>§527(b) undermines the Government’s reading of §101(12A) because it&para;<br>requires a debt relief agency to inform an assisted person of his right to&para;<br>hire an attorney, and it would be nonsensical to require attorneys to&para;<br>provide such notice. See Brief for National Association of Consumer&para;<br>Bankruptcy Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 34. This argument fails&para;<br>on its own terms. Even if §101(12A) excluded attorneys, as Milavetz&para;<br>contends, §527(b) would still produce the result of which its amici&para;<br>complain, as that provision also requires a debt relief agency to inform&para;<br>assisted persons that they “ ‘can get help in some localities from a&para;<br>bankruptcy petition preparer,’ ” and there is no question that bank&para;<br>ruptcy petition preparers are debt relief agencies and thus subject to&para;<br>that requirement. It is in any event not absurd to require debt relief&para;<br>agencies—whether attorneys or bankruptcy petition preparers—to&para;<br>inform prospective clients of their options for obtaining bankruptcy&para;<br>assistance services.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

Accordingly, we hold that attorneys who pro&para;<br>vide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are debt&para;<br>relief agencies within the meaning of the BAPCPA.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Having concluded that attorneys are debt relief agencies&para;<br>when they provide qualifying services, we next address the&para;<br>scope and validity of §526(a)(4). Characterizing the stat&para;<br>ute as a broad, content-based restriction on attorney-client&para;<br>communications that is not adequately tailored to con&para;<br>strain only speech the Government has a substantial&para;<br>interest in restricting, the Eighth Circuit found the rule&para;<br>substantially overbroad. 541 F. 3d, at 793–794, and n. 10.&para;<br>For the reasons that follow, we reject that conclusion.&para;<br>Section 526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency from&para;<br>“advis[ing] an assisted person” either “to incur more debt&para;<br>in contemplation of” filing for bankruptcy “or to pay an&para;<br>attorney or bankruptcy petition preparer fee or charge for&para;<br>services” performed in preparation for filing. Only the&para;<br>first of these prohibitions is at issue. In debating the&para;<br>correctness of the Court of Appeals’ decision, the parties&para;<br>first dispute the provision’s scope. The Court of Appeals&para;<br>concluded that “§526(a)(4) broadly prohibits a debt relief&para;<br>agency from advising an assisted person . . . to incur any&para;<br>additional debt when the assisted person is contemplating&para;<br>bankruptcy.” Id., at 793.

Construing the provision more&para;<br>broadly still, Milavetz contends that §526(a)(4) forbids not&para;<br>only affirmative advice but also any discussion of the&para;<br>advantages, disadvantages, or legality of incurring more&para;<br>debt. Like the panel majority’s, Milavetz’s reading rests&para;<br>primarily on its view that the ordinary meaning of the&para;<br>phrase “in contemplation of” bankruptcy encompasses any&para;<br>advice given to a debtor with the awareness that he might&para;<br>soon file for bankruptcy, even if the advice seeks to obviate&para;<br>the need to file. Milavetz also maintains that if §526(a)(4)&para;<br>were construed more narrowly, as urged by the Govern&para;<br>ment and the dissent below, it would be so vague as to&para;<br>inevitably chill some protected speech.&para;<br>The Government continues to advocate a narrower&para;<br>construction of the statute, urging that Milavetz’s reading&para;<br>is untenable and that its vagueness concerns are mis&para;<br>placed. The Government contends that §526(a)(4)’s re&para;<br>striction on advice to incur more debt “in contemplation of”&para;<br>bankruptcy is most naturally read to forbid only advice to&para;<br>undertake actions to abuse the bankruptcy system. Focus&para;<br>ing first on the provision’s text, the Government points to&para;<br>sources indicating that the phrase “in contemplation of”&para;<br>bankruptcy has long been, and continues to be, associated&para;<br>with abusive conduct. For instance, Black’s Law Diction&para;<br>ary 336 (8th ed. 2004) (hereinafter Black’s) defines “con&para;<br>templation of bankruptcy” as “[t]he thought of declaring&para;<br>bankruptcy because of the inability to continue current&para;<br>financial operations, often coupled with action designed to&para;<br>thwart the distribution of assets in a bankruptcy proceed&para;<br>ing.” Use of the phrase by Members of Congress illus&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

R. Doc. No. 93–137, pt.

Cas. 50, 53 (No. 10,873) (D. Vt.&para;<br>1843); Morgan v. Brundrett, 5 B. Ad. 288, 296–297, 110&para;<br>Eng. Rep. 798, 801 (K. B. 1833) (Parke, J.).&para;<br>To bolster its textual claim, the Government relies on&para;<br>§526(a)(4)’s immediate context. According to the Govern&para;<br>ment, the other three subsections of §526(a) are designed&para;<br>to protect debtors from abusive practices by debt relief&para;<br>agencies: §526(a)(1) requires debt relief agencies to per&para;<br>form all promised services; §526(a)(2) prohibits them from&para;<br>making or advising debtors to make false or misleading&para;<br>statements in bankruptcy; and §526(a)(3) prohibits them&para;<br>from misleading debtors regarding the costs or benefits of&para;<br>bankruptcy. When §526(a)(4) is read in context of these&para;<br>debtor-protective provisions, the Government argues,&para;<br>construing it to prevent debt relief agencies from giving&para;<br>advice that is beneficial to both debtors and their creditors&para;<br>seems particularly nonsensical.&para;<br>Finally, the Government contends that the BAPCPA’s&para;<br>remedies for violations of §526(a)(4) similarly corroborate&para;<br>its narrow reading.

The Government also relies on the Fifth Circuit’s&para;<br>decision in Hersh v. United States ex rel. Mukasey, 553&para;<br>F. 3d 743 (2008), and Judge Colloton’s dissent below for&para;<br>the observation that “Congress’s emphasis on actual dam&para;<br>ages for violations of section 526(a)(4) strongly suggests&para;<br>that Congress viewed that section as aimed at advice to&para;<br>debtors which if followed would have a significant risk of&para;<br>harming the debtor.” Id., at 760; see 541 F. 3d, at 800&para;<br>(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). By&para;<br>contrast, “legal and appropriate advice that would be&para;<br>protected by the First Amendment, yet prohibited by a&para;<br>broad reading of §526(a)(4), should cause no damage at&para;<br>all.” Ibid.; see Hersh, 541 F. 3d, at 760.&para;<br>Milavetz contends that the Government’s sources actu&para;<br>ally undermine its claim that the phrase “in contemplation&para;<br>of” bankruptcy necessarily refers to abusive conduct.&para;<br>Specifically, Milavetz argues that these authorities illus&para;<br>trate that “in contemplation of” bankruptcy is a neutral&para;<br>phrase that only implies abusive conduct when attached to&para;<br>an additional, proscriptive term. As Black’s states, the&para;<br>phrase is “often coupled with action designed to thwart the&para;<br>distribution of assets” in bankruptcy, Black’s 336 (empha&para;<br>sis added), but it carries no independent connotation of&para;<br>abuse. In support of that conclusion, Milavetz relies on&para;<br>our decision in Pender, 289 U. S. 472, contending that we&para;<br>construed “in contemplation of” bankruptcy in that case to&para;<br>describe “conduct with a view to a probable bankruptcy&para;<br>filing and nothing more.” Brief for Milavetz 61.&para;<br>After reviewing these competing claims, we are per&para;<br>suaded that a narrower reading of §526(a)(4) is sounder,&para;<br>although we do not adopt precisely the view the Govern&para;<br>ment advocates. The Government’s sources show that the&para;<br>phrase “in contemplation of” bankruptcy has so commonly&para;<br>been associated with abusive conduct that it may readily&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>be understood to prefigure abuse. As used in §526(a)(4),&para;<br>however, we think the phrase refers to a specific type of&para;<br>misconduct designed to manipulate the protections of the&para;<br>bankruptcy system. In light of our decision in Pender, and&para;<br>in context of other sections of the Code, we conclude that&para;<br>§526(a)(4) prohibits a debt relief agency only from advising&para;<br>a debtor to incur more debt because the debtor is filing for&para;<br>bankruptcy, rather than for a valid purpose.&para;<br>Pender addressed the meaning of former §96(d), which&para;<br>authorized reexamination of a debtor’s payment of attor&para;<br>ney’s fees “in contemplation of the filing of a petition.”&para;<br>Recognizing “ ‘the temptation of a failing debtor to deal too&para;<br>liberally with his property in enabling counsel to protect&para;<br>him,’ ” 289 U. S., at 478 (quoting In re Wood &amp; Henderson,&para;<br>210 U. S. 246, 253 (1908)), we read “in contemplation of&para;<br>. . . filing” in that context to require that the portended&para;<br>bankruptcy have “induce[d]” the transfer at issue, 289&para;<br>U. S., at 477, understanding inducement to engender&para;<br>suspicion of abuse. In so construing the statute, we identi&para;<br>fied the “controlling question” as “whether the thought of&para;<br>bankruptcy was the impelling cause of the transaction.”&para;<br>Ibid. Given the substantial similarities between §§96(d)&para;<br>and 526(a)(4), we think the controlling question under the&para;<br>latter provision is likewise whether the impelling reason&para;<br>for “advis[ing] an assisted person . . . to incur more debt”&para;<br>was the prospect of filing for bankruptcy.&para;<br>To be sure, there are relevant differences between the&para;<br>provision at issue in Pender and the one now under re&para;<br>view. Most notably, the inquiry in Pender was as to pay&para;<br>ments made on the eve of bankruptcy, whereas §526(a)(4)&para;<br>regards advice to incur additional debts. Consistent with&para;<br>that difference, under §96(d) a finding that a payment was&para;<br>made “in contemplation of” filing resolved only a threshold&para;<br>inquiry triggering further review of the reasonableness of&para;<br>the payment; the finding thus supported an inference of&para;<br>abuse but did not conclusively establish it. By contrast,&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>MILAVETZ, GALLOP &amp; MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>advice to incur more debt because of bankruptcy, as pro&para;<br>hibited by §526(a)(4), will generally consist of advice to&para;<br>“load up” on debt with the expectation of obtaining its&para;<br>discharge—i.e., conduct that is abusive per se.&para;<br>The statutory context supports the conclusion that&para;<br>§526(a)(4)’s prohibition primarily targets this type of&para;<br>abuse. Code provisions predating the BAPCPA already&para;<br>sought to prevent the practice of loading up on debt prior&para;<br>to filing. Section 523(a)(2), for instance, addressed the&para;<br>attendant risk of manipulation by preventing the dis&para;<br>charge of debts obtained by false pretenses and making&para;<br>debts for purchases of luxury goods or services presump&para;<br>tively nondischargeable. See §§523(a)(2)(A) and (C) (2000&para;<br>ed.). The BAPCPA increased the risk of such abuse, how&para;<br>ever, by providing a new mechanism for determining a&para;<br>debtor’s ability to repay. Pursuant to the “means tes[t],”&para;<br>§707(b)(2)(D) (2006 ed.), a debtor’s petition for Chapter 7&para;<br>relief is presumed abusive (and may therefore be dis&para;<br>missed or converted to a structured repayment plan under&para;<br>Chapter 13) if the debtor’s current monthly income ex&para;<br>ceeds his statutorily allowed expenses, including pay&para;<br>ments for secured debt, by more than a prescribed&para;<br>amount. See §§707(b)(2)(A)(i)–(iv). The test promotes&para;<br>debtor accountability but also enhances incentives to incur&para;<br>additional debt prior to filing, as payments on secured&para;<br>debts offset a debtor’s monthly income under the formula.&para;<br>Other amendments effected by the BAPCPA reflect a&para;<br>concern with this practice.&para;<br>For instance, Congress&para;<br>amended §523(a)(2) to expand the exceptions to discharge&para;<br>by lowering the threshold amount of new debt a debtor&para;<br>must assume to trigger the presumption of abuse under&para;<br>§523(a)(2)(C), and it extended the relevant prefiling win&para;<br>dow. See §310, 119 Stat. 84. In context, §526(a)(4) is best&para;<br>understood to provide an additional safeguard against the&para;<br>practice of loading up on debt prior to filing.&para;<br>The Government’s contextual arguments provide addi&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

The companion rules of&para;<br>professional conduct in §§526(a)(1)–(3) and the remedies&para;<br>for their violation in §526(c) indicate that Congress was&para;<br>concerned with actions that threaten to harm debtors or&para;<br>creditors. Unlike the reasonable financial advice the&para;<br>Eighth Circuit’s broad reading would proscribe, advice to&para;<br>incur more debt because of bankruptcy presents a sub&para;<br>stantial risk of injury to both debtors and creditors. See&para;<br>Hersh, 553 F. 3d, at 760–761. Specifically, the incurrence&para;<br>of such debt stands to harm a debtor if his prepetition&para;<br>conduct leads a court to hold his debts nondischargable,&para;<br>see §523(a)(2), convert his case to another chapter, or&para;<br>dismiss it altogether, see §707(b), thereby defeating his&para;<br>effort to obtain bankruptcy relief. If a debt, although&para;<br>manipulatively incurred, is not timely identified as abu&para;<br>sive and therefore is discharged, creditors will suffer harm&para;<br>as a result of the discharge and the consequent dilution of&para;<br>the bankruptcy estate. By contrast, the prudent advice&para;<br>that the Eighth Circuit’s view of the statute forbids would&para;<br>likely benefit both debtors and creditors and at the very&para;<br>least should cause no harm. See id., at 760; 541 F. 3d, at&para;<br>800 (Colloton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in&para;<br>part). For all of these reasons, we conclude that §526(a)(4)&para;<br>prohibits a debt relief agency only from advising an as&para;<br>sisted person to incur more debt when the impelling rea&para;<br>son for the advice is the anticipation of bankruptcy.&para;<br>That “[n]o other solution yields as sensible a” result&para;<br>further persuades us of the correctness of this narrow&para;<br>reading.

Sec&para;<br>tion 526(a)(4) by its terms prevents debt relief agencies&para;<br>only from “advis[ing]” assisted persons “to incur” more&para;<br>debt.

Cf. ABA Model Rule of&para;<br>Professional Conduct 1.2(d) (2009) (“A lawyer shall not&para;<br>counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct&para;<br>that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent, but a&para;<br>lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any pro&para;<br>posed course of conduct with a client and may counsel or&para;<br>assist a client to make a good faith effort to determine the&para;<br>validity, scope, meaning or application of the law”). Even&para;<br>if the statute were not clear in this regard, we would reach&para;<br>the same conclusion about its scope because the inhibition&para;<br>of frank discussion serves no conceivable purpose within&para;<br>the statutory scheme.

As discussed above, the Code&para;<br>authorizes a bankruptcy court to decline to discharge&para;<br>fraudulent debts, see §523(a)(2), or to dismiss a case or&para;<br>convert it to a case under another chapter if it finds that&para;<br>granting relief would constitute abuse, see §707(b)(1).&para;<br>Attorneys and other professionals who give debtors bank&para;<br>ruptcy advice must know of these provisions and their&para;<br>consequences for a debtor who in bad faith incurs addi&para;<br>tional debt prior to filing. Indeed, §707(b)(4)(C) states that&para;<br>an attorney’s signature on bankruptcy filings “shall consti&para;<br>tute a certification that the attorney has” determined that&para;<br>the filing “does not constitute an abuse under [§707(b)(1)].”&para;<br>Against this backdrop, it is hard to see how a rule that&para;<br>narrowly prohibits an attorney from affirmatively advising&para;<br>a client to commit this type of abusive prefiling conduct&para;<br>could chill attorney speech or inhibit the attorney-client&para;<br>relationship. Our construction of §526(a)(4) to prevent&para;<br>only advice principally motivated by the prospect of bank&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>ating the significance of such dialogue, we note that §526(a)(4), as&para;<br>&para;<br>narrowly construed, presents no impediment to “ ‘full and frank’ ” &para;<br>&para;<br>discussions.

Because&para;<br>our reading of the statute supplies a sufficient ground for&para;<br>reversing the Court of Appeals’ decision, and because&para;<br>Milavetz challenges the constitutionality of the statute, as&para;<br>narrowed, only on vagueness grounds, we need not further&para;<br>consider whether the statute so construed withstands&para;<br>First Amendment scrutiny.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Finally, we address the validity of §528’s challenged&para;<br>disclosure requirements. Our first task in resolving this&para;<br>——————&para;<br>6 The hypothetical questions Milavetz posits regarding the permissi&para;<br>bility of advice to incur debt in certain circumstances, see Brief for&para;<br>Milavetz 48–51, are easily answered by reference to whether the&para;<br>expectation of filing for bankruptcy (and obtaining a discharge) im&para;<br>pelled the advice. We emphasize that awareness of the possibility of&para;<br>bankruptcy is insufficient to trigger §526(a)(4)’s prohibition. Instead,&para;<br>that provision proscribes only advice to incur more debt that is princi&para;<br>pally motivated by that likelihood. Thus, advice to refinance a mort&para;<br>gage or purchase a reliable car prior to filing because doing so will&para;<br>reduce the debtor’s interest rates or improve his ability to repay is not&para;<br>prohibited, as the promise of enhanced financial prospects, rather than&para;<br>the anticipated filing, is the impelling cause.

The Court in that case&para;<br>held that restrictions on nonmisleading commercial speech&para;<br>regarding lawful activity must withstand intermediate&para;<br>scrutiny—that is, they must “directly advanc[e]” a sub&para;<br>stantial governmental interest and be “n[o] more extensive&para;<br>than is necessary to serve that interest.” Id., at 566.&para;<br>Contesting Milavetz’s premise, the Government maintains&para;<br>that §528 is directed at misleading commercial speech.&para;<br>For that reason, and because the challenged provisions&para;<br>impose a disclosure requirement rather than an affirma&para;<br>tive limitation on speech, the Government contends that&para;<br>the less exacting scrutiny described in Zauderer governs&para;<br>our review. We agree.&para;<br>Zauderer addressed the validity of a rule of professional&para;<br>conduct that required attorneys who advertised contin&para;<br>gency-fee services to disclose in their advertisements that&para;<br>a losing client might still be responsible for certain litiga&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 In so doing, we note that our ability to evaluate §528’s validity as&para;<br>applied to Milavetz is constrained by the lack of a developed record.&para;<br>Because the parties have introduced no exhibits or other evidence to&para;<br>ground our analysis, we are guided in this preenforcement challenge&para;<br>only by Milavetz’s status—i.e., as a law firm or attorney—and its&para;<br>general claims about the nature of its advertisements.&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>MILAVETZ, GALLOP &amp; MILAVETZ, P.

Noting that First Amendment protec&para;<br>tion for commercial speech is justified in large part by the&para;<br>information’s value to consumers, the Court concluded&para;<br>that an attorney’s constitutionally protected interest in not&para;<br>providing the required factual information is “minimal.”&para;<br>471 U. S., at 651. Unjustified or unduly burdensome&para;<br>disclosure requirements offend the First Amendment by&para;<br>chilling protected speech, but “an advertiser’s rights are&para;<br>adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements&para;<br>are reasonably related to the State’s interest in preventing&para;<br>deception of consumers.” Ibid.&para;<br>The challenged provisions of §528 share the essential&para;<br>features of the rule at issue in Zauderer. As in that case,&para;<br>§528’s required disclosures are intended to combat the&para;<br>problem of inherently misleading commercial advertise&para;<br>ments—specifically, the promise of debt relief without any&para;<br>reference to the possibility of filing for bankruptcy, which&para;<br>has inherent costs. Additionally, the disclosures entail&para;<br>only an accurate statement identifying the advertiser’s&para;<br>legal status and the character of the assistance provided,&para;<br>and they do not prevent debt relief agencies like Milavetz&para;<br>from conveying any additional information.&para;<br>The same characteristics of §528 that make it analogous&para;<br>to the rule in Zauderer serve to distinguish it from those&para;<br>at issue in In re R. M. J., 455 U. S. 191 (1982), to which&para;<br>the Court applied the intermediate scrutiny of Central&para;<br>Hudson. The ethical rules addressed in R. M. J. prohib&para;<br>ited attorneys from advertising their practice areas in&para;<br>terms other than those prescribed by the State Supreme&para;<br>Court and from announcing the courts in which they were&para;<br>admitted to practice. See 455 U. S., at 197–198. Finding&para;<br>that the restricted statements were not inherently mis&para;<br>leading and that the State had failed to show that the&para;<br>appellant’s advertisements were themselves likely to&para;<br>mislead consumers, see id., at 205, the Court applied&para;<br>Central Hudson’s intermediate scrutiny and invalidated&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U.

S., at 205–206. In so holding,&para;<br>the Court emphasized that States retain authority to&para;<br>regulate inherently misleading advertisements, particu&para;<br>larly through disclosure requirements, and it noted that&para;<br>advertisements for professional services pose a special risk&para;<br>of deception. See id., at 203, 207.&para;<br>Milavetz makes much of the fact that the Government&para;<br>in these consolidated cases has adduced no evidence that&para;<br>its advertisements are misleading. Zauderer forecloses&para;<br>that argument: “When the possibility of deception is as&para;<br>self-evident as it is in this case, we need not require the&para;<br>State to ‘conduct a survey of the . . . public before it [may]&para;<br>determine that the [advertisement] had a tendency to&para;<br>mislead.’ ” 471 U. S., at 652–653 (quoting FTC v. ColgatePalmolive Co., 380 U. S. 374, 391–392 (1965)). Evidence&para;<br>in the congressional record demonstrating a pattern of&para;<br>advertisements that hold out the promise of debt relief&para;<br>without alerting consumers to its potential cost, see 1998&para;<br>Hearings, pt. III, at 86, 90–94, is adequate to establish&para;<br>that the likelihood of deception in this case “is hardly a&para;<br>speculative one,” 471 U. S., at 652.&para;<br>Milavetz alternatively argues that the term “debt relief&para;<br>agency” is confusing and misleading and that requiring its&para;<br>inclusion in advertisements cannot be “reasonably related”&para;<br>to the Government’s interest in preventing consumer&para;<br>deception, as Zauderer requires. Id., at 651. This conten&para;<br>tion amounts to little more than a preference on Milavetz’s&para;<br>part for referring to itself as something other than a “debt&para;<br>relief agency”—e.g., an attorney or a law firm. For several&para;<br>reasons, we conclude that this preference lacks any consti&para;<br>tutional basis. First, Milavetz offers no evidence to sup&para;<br>port its claim that the label is confusing. Because §528 by&para;<br>its terms applies only to debt relief agencies, the disclo&para;<br>sures are necessarily accurate to that extent: Only debt&para;<br>relief agencies must identify themselves as such in their&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>MILAVETZ, GALLOP &amp; MILAVETZ, P. A. v. UNITED&para;<br>STATES&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>advertisements. This statement provides interested ob&para;<br>servers with pertinent information about the advertiser’s&para;<br>services and client obligations.&para;<br>Other information that Milavetz must or may include in&para;<br>its advertisements for bankruptcy-assistance services&para;<br>provides additional assurance that consumers will not&para;<br>misunderstand the term. The required statement that the&para;<br>advertiser “ ‘help[s] people file for bankruptcy relief’ ” gives&para;<br>meaningful context to the term “debt relief agency.” And&para;<br>Milavetz may further identify itself as a law firm or attor&para;<br>ney. Section 528 also gives Milavetz flexibility to tailor&para;<br>the disclosures to its individual circumstances, as long as&para;<br>the resulting statements are “substantially similar” to the&para;<br>statutory examples. §§528(a)(4) and (b)(2)(B).&para;<br>Finally, we reject Milavetz’s argument that §528 is not&para;<br>reasonably related to any governmental interest because it&para;<br>applies equally to attorneys who represent creditors, as&para;<br>Milavetz sometimes does. The required disclosures, Mi&para;<br>lavetz contends, would be counterfactual and misleading&para;<br>in that context. This claim is premised on an untenable&para;<br>reading of the statute. We think it evident from the defi&para;<br>nition of “assisted person”—which is stated in terms of the&para;<br>person’s debts, see §101(3)—and from the text and struc&para;<br>ture of the debt-relief-agency provisions in §§526, 527, and&para;<br>528 that those provisions, including §528’s disclosure&para;<br>requirements, govern only professionals who offer bank&para;<br>ruptcy-related services to consumer debtors. Section 528&para;<br>is itself expressly concerned with advertisements pertain&para;<br>ing to “bankruptcy assistance services,” “the benefits of&para;<br>bankruptcy,” “excessive debt, debt collection pressure, or&para;<br>inability to pay any consumer debt,” §§528(a)(3) and (b)(2).&para;<br>Moreover, like the other debt-relief-agency provisions, that&para;<br>section is codified in a subchapter of the Bankruptcy Code&para;<br>entitled “DEBTOR’S DUTIES AND BENEFITS.”&para;<br>11&para;<br>U.

Once&para;<br>again, we decline Milavetz’s invitation to adopt a view of&para;<br>the statute that is contrary to its plain meaning and would&para;<br>produce an absurd result.&para;<br>Because §528’s requirements that Milavetz identify&para;<br>itself as a debt relief agency and include certain informa&para;<br>tion about its bankruptcy-assistance and related services&para;<br>are “reasonably related to the [Government’s] interest in&para;<br>preventing deception of consumers,” Zauderer, 471 U.

For the proposition that “the legislative record&para;<br>elsewhere documents misconduct by attorneys” which was&para;<br>presumably the concern of Congress, the Court cites a&para;<br>reproduction of a tasteless advertisement that was (1) an&para;<br>attachment to the written statement of a witness, (2) in a&para;<br>hearing held seven years prior to this statute’s passage,&para;<br>(3) before a subcommittee of the House considering a&para;<br>different consumer bankruptcy reform bill that never&para;<br>passed.* “Elsewhere” indeed.&para;<br>The Court acknowledges that nothing can be gained by&para;<br>this superfluous citation (it admits the footnote is “unnec&para;<br>essary in light of the statute’s unambiguous language,”&para;<br>ante, at 6, n. 3).

I see no reason why&para;<br>that difference should acquire constitutional significance&para;<br>merely because the regulations at issue involve commer&para;<br>cial speech. See Glickman v.

See Borgner v.&para;<br>Florida Bd. of Dentistry, 537 U. S. 1080, 1082 (2002)&para;<br>(THOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). Zaud&para;<br>erer upheld the imposition of sanctions against an attor&para;<br>ney under a rule of professional conduct that required&para;<br>advertisements for contingency-fee services to disclose&para;<br>that losing clients might be responsible for litigation fees&para;<br>and costs. See 471 U. S., at 650–653. Importantly, how&para;<br>ever, Zauderer’s advertisement was found to be misleading&para;<br>on its face, and the regulation in that case did not man&para;<br>date the specific form or text of the disclosure.

Thus,&para;<br>Zauderer does not stand for the proposition that the gov&para;<br>ernment can constitutionally compel the use of a scripted&para;<br>disclaimer in any circumstance in which its interest in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 I have no quarrel with the principle that advertisements that are&para;<br>false or misleading, or that propose an illegal transaction, may be&para;<br>proscribed. See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S. 484, 520&para;<br>(1996) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).&para;<br>Furthermore, I acknowledge this Court’s longstanding assumption that&para;<br>a consumer-fraud regulation that compels the disclosure of certain&para;<br>factual information in advertisements may intrude less significantly on&para;<br>First Amendment interests than an outright prohibition on all adver&para;<br>tisements that have the potential to mislead. See, e.g., Virginia Bd. of&para;<br>Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748,&para;<br>771–772 (1976); Zauderer v.

A. v. UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of THOMAS, J. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>preventing consumer deception might plausibly be at&para;<br>stake. In other words, a bare assertion by the government&para;<br>that a disclosure requirement is “intended” to prevent&para;<br>consumer deception, standing alone, is not sufficient to&para;<br>uphold the requirement as applied to all speech that falls&para;<br>within its sweep. See ante, at 20.&para;<br>Instead, our precedents make clear that regulations&para;<br>aimed at false or misleading advertisements are permissi&para;<br>ble only where “the particular advertising is inherently&para;<br>likely to deceive or where the record indicates that a par&para;<br>ticular form or method of advertising has in fact been&para;<br>deceptive.” In re R. M. J., 455 U.

There&para;<br>fore, a disclosure requirement passes constitutional mus&para;<br>ter only to the extent that it is aimed at advertisements&para;<br>that, by their nature, possess these traits. See R.

Accordingly, and with that understanding, I&para;<br>turn to the question whether Milavetz’s challenge to&para;<br>§528’s disclosure requirements survives Zauderer scrutiny&para;<br>on the record before us.&para;<br>As the Court notes, the posture of Milavetz’s challenge&para;<br>inhibits our review of its First Amendment claim. See&para;<br>ante, at 19, n. 7. Milavetz challenged §528’s constitution&para;<br>ality before the statute had ever been enforced against any&para;<br>of the firm’s advertisements. Although Milavetz purports&para;<br>to challenge §528 only “ ‘as-applied’ ” to its own advertis&para;<br>ing, see ante, at 19, it did not introduce any evidence or&para;<br>exhibits to substantiate its claim. Thus, no court has seen&para;<br>a sampling of Milavetz’s advertisements or even a declara&para;<br>tion describing their contents and the media through&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of THOMAS, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>which Milavetz seeks to transmit them. As a consequence,&para;<br>Milavetz’s nominal “as applied” challenge appears strik&para;<br>ingly similar to a facial challenge.&para;<br>We generally disapprove of such challenges because&para;<br>they “often rest on speculation” and require courts to&para;<br>engage in “ ‘premature interpretation of statutes on the&para;<br>basis of factually barebones records.’ ” Washington State&para;<br>Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U. S.&para;<br>442, 450 (2008) (quoting Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S.&para;<br>600, 609 (2004)). Milavetz’s claim invites the same prob&para;<br>lems. Milavetz alleges that §528’s disclosure require&para;<br>ments are unconstitutional as applied to its advertise&para;<br>ments because its advertisements are not misleading and&para;<br>because the disclaimer required by §528 will create, rather&para;<br>than reduce, confusion for Milavetz’s potential clients.&para;<br>That may well be true. But because no record evidence of&para;<br>Milavetz’s advertisements exists to guide our review, we&para;<br>can only speculate about the ways in which the statute&para;<br>might be applied to Milavetz’s speech.&para;<br>When forced to determine the constitutionality of a&para;<br>statute based solely on such conjecture, we will uphold the&para;<br>law if there is any “conceivabl[e]” manner in which it can&para;<br>be enforced consistent with the First Amendment. Wash&para;<br>ington State Grange, supra, at 456. In this case, both&para;<br>parties agree that §528’s disclosure requirements cover, at&para;<br>a minimum, deceptive advertisements that promise to&para;<br>“ ‘wipe out’ ” debts without mentioning bankruptcy as the&para;<br>means of accomplishing this goal.2 Brief for Milavetz 82,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 At&para;<br>&para;<br>oral argument, Milavetz’s counsel declined to describe Milavetz’s&para;<br>challenge to §528 as a facial overbreadth claim, Tr. of Oral Arg. 25–26,&para;<br>and Milavetz’s briefs make no such contention.
