Detroit Timber &amp; Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLAND v. FLORIDA&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–5327. Argued March 1, 2010—Decided June 14, 2010&para;<br>Petitioner Holland was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced&para;<br>to death in Florida state court. After the State Supreme Court af&para;<br>firmed on direct appeal and denied collateral relief, Holland filed a&para;<br>pro se federal habeas corpus petition, which was approximately five&para;<br>weeks late under the 1-year statute of limitations set forth in the An&para;<br>titerrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §2244(d). The record facts reveal, inter alia, that Holland’s&para;<br>court-appointed attorney, Bradley Collins, had failed to file a timely&para;<br>federal petition, despite Holland’s many letters emphasizing the im&para;<br>portance of doing so; that Collins apparently did not do the research&para;<br>necessary to find out the proper filing date, despite the fact that Hol&para;<br>land had identified the applicable legal rules for him; that Collins&para;<br>failed to inform Holland in a timely manner that the State Supreme&para;<br>Court had decided his case, despite Holland’s many pleas for that in&para;<br>formation; and that Collins failed to communicate with Holland over&para;<br>a period of years, despite Holland’s pleas for responses to his letters.&para;<br>Meanwhile, Holland repeatedly requested that the state courts and&para;<br>the Florida bar remove Collins from his case. Based on these and&para;<br>other record facts, Holland asked the Federal District Court to toll&para;<br>the AEDPA limitations period for equitable reasons. It refused, hold&para;<br>ing that he had not demonstrated the due diligence necessary to in&para;<br>voke equitable tolling. Affirming, the Eleventh Circuit held that, re&para;<br>gardless of diligence, Holland’s case did not constitute “extraordinary&para;<br>circumstances.” Specifically, it held that when a petitioner seeks to&para;<br>excuse a late filing based on his attorney’s unprofessional conduct,&para;<br>that conduct, even if grossly negligent, cannot justify equitable toll&para;<br>ing absent proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental im&para;<br>pairment, or the like.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLAND v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. Section 2244(d), the AEDPA statute of limitations, is subject to&para;<br>equitable tolling in appropriate cases. Pp. 12–21.&para;<br>(a) Several considerations support the Court’s holding. First, be&para;<br>cause AEDPA’s “statute of limitations defense . . . is not ‘jurisdic&para;<br>tional,’ ” Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 205, 213, it is subject to a&para;<br>“rebuttable presumption” in favor “of equitable tolling,” Irwin v. De&para;<br>partment of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95–96. That presump&para;<br>tion’s strength is reinforced here by the fact that “equitable princi&para;<br>ples” have traditionally “governed” substantive habeas law. Munaf v.&para;<br>Geren, 553 U. S. 674, ___, and the fact that Congress enacted AEDPA&para;<br>after Irwin and therefore was likely aware that courts, when inter&para;<br>preting AEDPA’s timing provisions, would apply the presumption,&para;<br>see, e.g., Merck &amp; Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S. ___, ___. Second,&para;<br>§2244(d) differs significantly from the statutes at issue in United&para;<br>States v. Brockamp, 519 U. S. 347, 350–352, and United States v.&para;<br>Beggerly, 524 U. S. 38, 49, in which the Court held that Irwin’s pre&para;<br>sumption had been overcome. For example, unlike the subject mat&para;<br>ters at issue in those cases—tax collection and land claims—&para;<br>AEDPA’s subject matter, habeas corpus, pertains to an area of the&para;<br>law where equity finds a comfortable home. See Munaf, supra, at&para;<br>___. Brockamp, supra, at 352, distinguished. Moreover, AEDPA’s&para;<br>limitations period is neither unusually generous nor unusually com&para;<br>plex. Finally, the Court disagrees with respondent’s argument that&para;<br>equitable tolling undermines AEDPA’s basic purpose of eliminating&para;<br>delays in the federal habeas review process, see, e.g., Day, supra, at&para;<br>205–206. AEDPA seeks to do so without undermining basic habeas&para;<br>corpus principles and by harmonizing the statute with prior law, un&para;<br>der which a petition’s timeliness was always determined under equi&para;<br>table principles. See, e.g., Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 483.&para;<br>Such harmonization, along with the Great Writ’s importance as the&para;<br>only writ explicitly protected by the Constitution, counsels hesitancy&para;<br>before interpreting AEDPA’s silence on equitable tolling as congres&para;<br>sional intent to close courthouse doors that a strong equitable claim&para;<br>would keep open. Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>(b) The Eleventh Circuit’s per se standard is too rigid. A “peti&para;<br>tioner” is “entitled to equitable tolling” if he shows “(1) that he has&para;<br>been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary&para;<br>circumstance stood in his way” and prevented timely filing. Pace v.&para;<br>DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418. Such “extraordinary circumstances”&para;<br>are not limited to those that satisfy the Eleventh Circuit’s test.&para;<br>Courts must often “exercise [their] equity powers . . . on a case-by&para;<br>case basis,” Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360, 375, demonstrating&para;<br>“flexibility” and avoiding “mechanical rules,” Holmberg v. Armbrecht,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>327 U. S. 392, 396, in order to “relieve hardships . . . aris[ing] from a&para;<br>hard and fast adherence” to more absolute legal rules, Hazel-Atlas&para;<br>Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U. S. 238, 248. The Court’s&para;<br>cases recognize that equity courts can and do draw upon decisions&para;<br>made in other similar cases for guidance, exercising judgment in light&para;<br>of precedent, but with awareness of the fact that specific circum&para;<br>stances, often hard to predict, could warrant special treatment in an&para;<br>appropriate case. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 753, distin&para;<br>guished. No pre-existing rule of law or precedent demands the Elev&para;<br>enth Circuit’s rule. That rule is difficult to reconcile with more gen&para;<br>eral equitable principles in that it fails to recognize that, at least&para;<br>sometimes, an attorney’s unprofessional conduct can be so egregious&para;<br>as to create an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable toll&para;<br>ing, as several other federal courts have specifically held. Although&para;<br>equitable tolling is not warranted for “a garden variety claim of ex&para;<br>cusable neglect,” Irwin, supra, at 96, this case presents far more seri&para;<br>ous instances of attorney misconduct than that. Pp. 16–19.&para;<br>2. While the record facts suggest that this case may well present&para;<br>“extraordinary” circumstances, the Court does not state its conclusion&para;<br>absolutely because more proceedings may be necessary. The District&para;<br>Court incorrectly rested its ruling not on a lack of such circum&para;<br>stances, but on a lack of diligence. Here, Holland diligently pursued&para;<br>his rights by writing Collins numerous letters seeking crucial infor&para;<br>mation and providing direction, by repeatedly requesting that Collins&para;<br>be removed from his case, and by filing his own pro se habeas petition&para;<br>on the day he learned his AEDPA filing period had expired. Because&para;<br>the District Court erroneously concluded that Holland was not dili&para;<br>gent, and because the Court of Appeals erroneously relied on an&para;<br>overly rigid per se approach, no lower court has yet considered&para;<br>whether the facts of this case indeed constitute extraordinary cir&para;<br>cumstances sufficient to warrant equitable tolling. The Eleventh&para;<br>Circuit may determine on remand whether such tolling is appropri&para;<br>ate, or whether an evidentiary hearing and other proceedings might&para;<br>indicate that the State should prevail. Pp. 19–21.&para;<br>539 F. 3d 1334, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,&para;<br>C.

FLORIDA&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF &para;<br>&para;<br>APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>[June 14, 2010] &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>We here decide that the timeliness provision in the&para;<br>federal habeas corpus statute is subject to equitable toll&para;<br>ing. See Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of&para;<br>1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. §2244(d). We also consider its&para;<br>application in this case. In the Court of Appeals’ view,&para;<br>when a petitioner seeks to excuse a late filing on the basis&para;<br>of his attorney’s unprofessional conduct, that conduct,&para;<br>even if it is “negligent” or “grossly negligent,” cannot “rise&para;<br>to the level of egregious attorney misconduct” that would&para;<br>warrant equitable tolling unless the petitioner offers&para;<br>“proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental&para;<br>impairment or so forth.” 539 F. 3d 1334, 1339 (CA11&para;<br>2008) (per curiam). In our view, this standard is too rigid.&para;<br>See Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89,&para;<br>96 (1990); see also Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U. S. 327, 336&para;<br>(2007). We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of&para;<br>Appeals and remand for further proceedings.&para;<br>I&para;<br>AEDPA states that “[a] 1-year period of limitation shall&para;<br>apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a&para;<br>person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLAND v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>court.” §2244(d)(1). It also says that “[t]he time during&para;<br>which a properly filed application for State post-conviction&para;<br>. . . review” is “pending shall not be counted” against the 1&para;<br>year period. §2244(d)(2).&para;<br>On January 19, 2006, Albert Holland filed a pro se&para;<br>habeas corpus petition in the Federal District Court for&para;<br>the Southern District of Florida. Both Holland (the peti&para;<br>tioner) and the State of Florida (the respondent) agree&para;<br>that, unless equitably tolled, the statutory limitations&para;<br>period applicable to Holland’s petition expired approxi&para;<br>mately five weeks before the petition was filed. See Brief&para;<br>for Respondent 9, and n. 7; Brief for Petitioner 5, and n. 4.&para;<br>Holland asked the District Court to toll the limitations&para;<br>period for equitable reasons. We shall set forth in some&para;<br>detail the record facts that underlie Holland’s claim.&para;<br>A&para;<br>In 1997, Holland was convicted of first-degree murder&para;<br>and sentenced to death. The Florida Supreme Court&para;<br>affirmed that judgment. Holland v. State, 773 So. 2d 1065&para;<br>(Fla. 2000). On October 1, 2001, this Court denied Hol&para;<br>land’s petition for certiorari. 534 U. S. 834. And on that&para;<br>date—the date that our denial of the petition ended fur&para;<br>ther direct review of Holland’s conviction—the 1-year&para;<br>AEDPA limitations clock began to run. See 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2244(d)(1)(A); Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2009) (slip op., at 6).&para;<br>Thirty-seven days later, on November 7, 2001, Florida&para;<br>appointed attorney Bradley Collins to represent Holland&para;<br>in all state and federal postconviction proceedings. Cf.&para;<br>Fla. Stat. §§27.710, 27.711(2) (2007). By September 19,&para;<br>2002—316 days after his appointment and 12 days before&para;<br>the 1-year AEDPA limitations period expired—Collins,&para;<br>acting on Holland’s behalf, filed a motion for postconvic&para;<br>tion relief in the state trial court. Cf. Brief for Respondent&para;<br>9, n. 7. That filing automatically stopped the running of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the AEDPA limitations period, §2244(d)(2), with, as we&para;<br>have said, 12 days left on the clock.&para;<br>For the next three years, Holland’s petition remained&para;<br>pending in the state courts. During that time, Holland&para;<br>wrote Collins letters asking him to make certain that all of&para;<br>his claims would be preserved for any subsequent federal&para;<br>habeas corpus review. Collins wrote back, stating, “I&para;<br>would like to reassure you that we are aware of state-time&para;<br>limitations and federal exhaustion requirements.” App.&para;<br>55. He also said that he would “presen[t] . . . to the . . .&para;<br>federal courts” any of Holland’s claims that the state&para;<br>courts denied. Ibid. In a second letter Collins added,&para;<br>“should your Motion for Post-Conviction Relief be denied”&para;<br>by the state courts, “your state habeas corpus claims will&para;<br>then be ripe for presentation in a petition for writ of ha&para;<br>beas corpus in federal court.” Id., at 61.&para;<br>In mid-May 2003 the state trial court denied Holland&para;<br>relief, and Collins appealed that denial to the Florida&para;<br>Supreme Court. Almost two years later, in February&para;<br>2005, the Florida Supreme Court heard oral argument in&para;<br>the case. See 539 F. 3d, at 1337. But during that 2-year&para;<br>period, relations between Collins and Holland began to&para;<br>break down. Indeed, between April 2003 and January&para;<br>2006, Collins communicated with Holland only three&para;<br>times—each time by letter. See No. 1:06–cv–20182–PAS&para;<br>(SD Fla., Apr. 27, 2007), p. 7, n. 6 (hereinafter District&para;<br>Court opinion), App. 91, n. 6.&para;<br>Holland, unhappy with this lack of communication,&para;<br>twice wrote to the Florida Supreme Court, asking it to&para;<br>remove Collins from his case. In the second letter, filed on&para;<br>June 17, 2004, he said that he and Collins had experi&para;<br>enced “a complete breakdown in communication.” App.&para;<br>160. Holland informed the court that Collins had “not&para;<br>kept [him] updated on the status of [his] capital case” and&para;<br>that Holland had “not seen or spoken to” Collins “since&para;<br>April 2003.” Id., at 150. He wrote, “Mr. Collins has aban&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLAND v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>doned [me]” and said, “[I have] no idea what is going on&para;<br>with [my] capital case on appeal.” Id., at 152. He added&para;<br>that “Collins has never made any reasonable effort to&para;<br>establish any relationship of trust or confidence with&para;<br>[me],” id., at 155, and stated that he “does not trust” or&para;<br>have “any confidence in Mr. Collin’s ability to represent&para;<br>[him],” id., at 152. Holland concluded by asking that&para;<br>Collins be “dismissed (removed) off his capital case” or&para;<br>that he be given a hearing in order to demonstrate Collins’&para;<br>deficiencies. Id., at 155, 161. The State responded that&para;<br>Holland could not file any pro se papers with the court&para;<br>while he was represented by counsel, including papers&para;<br>seeking new counsel. Id., at 42–45. The Florida Supreme&para;<br>Court agreed and denied Holland’s requests. Id., at 46.&para;<br>During this same period Holland wrote various letters to&para;<br>the Clerk of the Florida Supreme Court. In the last of&para;<br>these he wrote, “[I]f I had a competent, conflict-free, post&para;<br>conviction, appellate attorney representing me, I would not&para;<br>have to write you this letter. I’m not trying to get on your&para;<br>nerves. I just would like to know exactly what is happen&para;<br>ing with my case on appeal to the Supreme Court of Flor&para;<br>ida.” Id., at 147. During that same time period, Holland&para;<br>also filed a complaint against Collins with the Florida Bar&para;<br>Association, but the complaint was denied. Id., at 65–67.&para;<br>Collins argued Holland’s appeal before the Florida&para;<br>Supreme Court on February 10, 2005. 539 F. 3d, at 1337.&para;<br>Shortly thereafter, Holland wrote to Collins emphasizing&para;<br>the importance of filing a timely petition for habeas corpus&para;<br>in federal court once the Florida Supreme Court issued its&para;<br>ruling. Specifically, on March 3, 2005, Holland wrote:&para;<br>“Dear Mr. Collins, P. A.:&para;<br>“How are you? Fine I hope.&para;<br>“I write this letter to ask that you please write me&para;<br>back, as soon as possible to let me know what the&para;<br>status of my case is on appeal to the Supreme Court of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Fine I hope.&para;<br>“On March 3, 2005 I wrote you a letter, asking that&para;<br>you let me know the status of my case on appeal to the&para;<br>Supreme Court of Florida.&para;<br>“Also, have you begun preparing my 28 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2254 writ of Habeas Corpus petition? Please let me&para;<br>know, as soon as possible.&para;<br>“Thank you.” Id., at 212 (emphasis added).&para;<br>But again, Collins did not reply.&para;<br>Five months later, in November 2005, the Florida Su&para;<br>preme Court affirmed the lower court decision denying&para;<br>Holland relief. Holland v. State, 916 So. 2d 750 (per cu&para;<br>riam). Three weeks after that, on December 1, 2005, the&para;<br>court issued its mandate, making its decision final. 539&para;<br>F. 3d, at 1337. At that point, the AEDPA federal habeas&para;<br>clock again began to tick—with 12 days left on the 1-year&para;<br>meter. See Coates v. Byrd, 211 F. 3d 1225 (CA11 2000)&para;<br>(per curiam) (AEDPA clock restarts when state court&para;<br>completes postconviction review); Lawrence, 549 U. S. 327&para;<br>(same). Twelve days later, on December 13, 2005, Hol&para;<br>land’s AEDPA time limit expired.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Four weeks after the AEDPA time limit expired, on&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLAND v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>January 9, 2006, Holland, still unaware of the Florida&para;<br>Supreme Court ruling issued in his case two months ear&para;<br>lier, wrote Collins a third letter:&para;<br>“Dear Mr. Bradley M. Collins:&para;<br>“How are you? Fine I hope.&para;<br>“I write this letter to ask that you please let me&para;<br>know the status of my appeals before the Supreme&para;<br>Court of Florida.

He immediately wrote out his&para;<br>own pro se federal habeas petition and mailed it to the&para;<br>Federal District Court for the Southern District of Florida&para;<br>the next day. Ibid. The petition begins by stating,&para;<br>“Comes now Albert R. Holland, Jr., a Florida death&para;<br>row inmate and states that court appointed counsel&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Rule 2254&para;<br>Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus on my behalf.”&para;<br>App. 181.&para;<br>It then describes the various constitutional claims that&para;<br>Holland hoped to assert in federal court.&para;<br>The same day that he mailed that petition, Holland&para;<br>received a letter from Collins telling him that Collins&para;<br>intended to file a petition for certiorari in this Court from&para;<br>the State Supreme Court’s most recent ruling. Holland&para;<br>answered immediately:&para;<br>“Dear Mr. Bradley M.

See Coates, supra, at&para;<br>1226–1227 (AEDPA not tolled during pendency of petition&para;<br>for certiorari from judgment denying state postconviction&para;<br>review); accord, Lawrence v. Florida, 421 F. 3d 1221, 1225&para;<br>(CA11 2005), aff’d, 549 U. S., at 331–336.&para;<br>On January 26, 2006, Holland tried to call Collins from&para;<br>prison. But he called collect and Collins’ office would not&para;<br>accept the call. App. 218. Five days later, Collins wrote to&para;<br>Holland and told him for the very first time that, as&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLAND v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Collins understood AEDPA law, the limitations period&para;<br>applicable to Holland’s federal habeas application had in&para;<br>fact expired in 2000—before Collins had begun to repre&para;<br>sent Holland. Specifically, Collins wrote:&para;<br>“Dear Mr. Holland:&para;<br>“I am in receipt of your letter dated January 20,&para;<br>2006 concerning operation of AEDPA time limitations.&para;<br>One hurdle in our upcoming efforts at obtaining fed&para;<br>eral habeas corpus relief will be that the one-year&para;<br>statutory time frame for filing such a petition began to&para;<br>run after the case was affirmed on October 5, 2000&para;<br>[when your] Judgment and Sentence . . . were af&para;<br>firmed by the Florida Supreme Court.

As we have said,&para;<br>Holland’s 1-year limitations period did not begin to run&para;<br>until this Court denied Holland’s petition for certiorari&para;<br>from the state courts’ denial of relief on direct review,&para;<br>which occurred on October 1, 2001.

And when&para;<br>Collins was appointed (on November 7, 2001) the AEDPA&para;<br>clock therefore had 328 days left to go.&para;<br>Holland immediately wrote back to Collins, pointing this&para;<br>out.&para;<br>“Dear Mr. Collins:&para;<br>“I received your letter dated January 31, 2006.

That meant&para;<br>that the time would be tolled once I filed my [postcon&para;<br>viction] motion in the trial court.&para;<br>“Also, Mr. Collins you never told me that my time&para;<br>ran out (expired). I told you to timely file my 28&para;<br>U. S. C. 2254 Habeas Corpus Petition before the dead&para;<br>line, so that I would not be time-barred.&para;<br>“You never informed me of oral arguments or of the&para;<br>Supreme Court of Florida’s November 10, 2005 deci&para;<br>sion denying my postconviction appeals.

Have you heard anything&para;<br>about the aforesaid motion? Do you know what the&para;<br>status of aforesaid motion is?&para;<br>“Mr. Collins, please file my 2254 Habeas Petition&para;<br>immediately.

FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“Thank you very much.” App. 222–223.&para;<br>Collins did not answer this letter. Nor did he file a federal&para;<br>habeas petition as Holland requested.&para;<br>On March 1, 2006, Holland filed another complaint&para;<br>against Collins with the Florida Bar Association. See&para;<br>Record, Doc. 41, Exh. 1, p. 8. This time the bar asked&para;<br>Collins to respond, which he did, through his own attor&para;<br>ney, on March 21. Id., at 2. And the very next day, over&para;<br>three months after Holland’s AEDPA statute of limita&para;<br>tions had expired, Collins mailed a proposed federal ha&para;<br>beas petition to Holland, asking him to review it. See id.,&para;<br>Doc. 20, Exh. W.&para;<br>But by that point Holland had already filed a pro se&para;<br>motion in the District Court asking that Collins be dis&para;<br>missed as his attorney. App. 192. The State responded to&para;<br>that request by arguing once again that Holland could not&para;<br>file a pro se motion seeking to have Collins removed while&para;<br>he was represented by counsel, i.e., represented by Collins.&para;<br>See id., at 47–51. But this time the court considered&para;<br>Holland’s motion, permitted Collins to withdraw from the&para;<br>case, and appointed a new lawyer for Holland. See Re&para;<br>cord, Docs. 9–10, 17–18, 22. And it also received briefing&para;<br>on whether the circumstances of the case justified the&para;<br>equitable tolling of the AEDPA limitations period for a&para;<br>sufficient period of time (approximately five weeks) to&para;<br>make Holland’s petition timely.&para;<br>C&para;<br>After considering the briefs, the Federal District Court&para;<br>held that the facts did not warrant equitable tolling and&para;<br>that consequently Holland’s petition was untimely. The&para;<br>court, noting that Collins had prepared numerous filings&para;<br>on Holland’s behalf in the state courts, and suggesting&para;<br>that Holland was a difficult client, intimated, but did not&para;<br>hold, that Collins’ professional conduct in the case was at&para;<br>worst merely “negligent.” See District Court opinion 7–8,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>App. 90–93. But the court rested its holding on an alter&para;<br>native rationale: It wrote that, even if Collins’ “behavior&para;<br>could be characterized as an ‘extraordinary circum&para;<br>stance,’ ” Holland “did not seek any help from the court&para;<br>system to find out the date [the] mandate issued denying&para;<br>his state habeas petition, nor did he seek aid from ‘outside&para;<br>supporters.’ ” Id., at 8, App. 92. Hence, the court held,&para;<br>Holland did not “demonstrate” the “due diligence” neces&para;<br>sary to invoke “equitable tolling.” Ibid.&para;<br>On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit agreed with the District&para;<br>Court that Holland’s habeas petition was untimely. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals first agreed with Holland that&para;<br>“ ‘[e]quitable tolling can be applied to . . . AEDPA’s statu&para;<br>tory deadline.’ ” 539 F. 3d, at 1338 (quoting Helton v.&para;<br>Secretary for Dept. of Corrections, 259 F. 3d 1310, 1312&para;<br>(CA11 2001)). But it also held that equitable tolling could&para;<br>not be applied in a case, like Holland’s, that involves no&para;<br>more than “[p]ure professional negligence” on the part of a&para;<br>petitioner’s attorney because such behavior can never&para;<br>constitute an “extraordinary circumstance.” 539 F. 3d, at&para;<br>1339. The court wrote:&para;<br>“We will assume that Collins’s alleged conduct is neg&para;<br>ligent, even grossly negligent. But in our view, no al&para;<br>legation of lawyer negligence or of failure to meet a&para;<br>lawyer’s standard of care—in the absence of an allega&para;<br>tion and proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty,&para;<br>mental impairment or so forth on the lawyer’s part—&para;<br>can rise to the level of egregious attorney misconduct&para;<br>that would entitle Petitioner to equitable tolling.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>Holland made “no allegation” that Collins had made a&para;<br>“knowing or reckless factual misrepresentation,” or that&para;<br>he exhibited “dishonesty,” “divided loyalty,” or “mental&para;<br>impairment.” Ibid. Hence, the court held, equitable toll&para;<br>ing was per se inapplicable to Holland’s habeas petition.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLAND v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The court did not address the District Court’s ruling with&para;<br>respect to Holland’s diligence.&para;<br>Holland petitioned for certiorari. Because the Court of&para;<br>Appeals’ application of the equitable tolling doctrine to&para;<br>instances of professional misconduct conflicts with the&para;<br>approach taken by other Circuits, we granted the petition.&para;<br>Compare 539 F. 3d 1334 (case below), with, e.g., Bal&para;<br>dayaque v. United States, 338 F. 3d 145, 152–153 (CA2&para;<br>2003) (applying a less categorical approach); Spitsyn v.&para;<br>Moore, 345 F. 3d 796, 801–802 (CA9 2003) (same).&para;<br>II&para;<br>We have not decided whether AEDPA’s statutory limita&para;<br>tions period may be tolled for equitable reasons. See&para;<br>Lawrence, 549 U. S., at 336; Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544&para;<br>U. S. 408, 418, n. 8 (2005). Now, like all 11 Courts of&para;<br>Appeals that have considered the question, we hold that&para;<br>§2244(d) is subject to equitable tolling in appropriate&para;<br>cases. See Neverson v. Farquharson, 366 F. 3d 32, 41&para;<br>(CA1 2004); Smith v. McGinnis, 208 F. 3d 13, 17 (CA2&para;<br>2000) (per curiam); Miller v. New Jersey Dept. of Correc&para;<br>tions, 145 F. 3d 616, 617 (CA3 1998); Harris v. Hutchin&para;<br>son, 209 F. 3d 325, 329–330 (CA4 2000); Davis v.

United States, 177 F. 3d 1269, 1272&para;<br>(CA11 1999) (per curiam).&para;<br>We base our conclusion on the following considerations.&para;<br>First, the AEDPA “statute of limitations defense . . . is not&para;<br>‘jurisdictional.’ ” Day v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 205&para;<br>(2006). It does not set forth “an inflexible rule requiring&para;<br>dismissal whenever” its “clock has run.” Id., at 208. See&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>also id., at 213 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“We have repeat&para;<br>edly stated that the enactment of time-limitation periods&para;<br>such as that in §2244(d), without further elaboration,&para;<br>produces defenses that are nonjurisdictional and thus&para;<br>subject to waiver and forfeiture” (citing cases)); Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 22 (describing AEDPA limitations period as&para;<br>“non-jurisdictional”).&para;<br>We have previously made clear that a nonjurisdictional&para;<br>federal statute of limitations is normally subject to a&para;<br>“rebuttable presumption” in favor “of equitable tolling.”&para;<br>Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95–96; see also Young v. United States,&para;<br>535 U. S. 43, 49 (2002) (“It is hornbook law that limita&para;<br>tions periods are ‘customarily subject to “equitable toll&para;<br>ing” ’ ” (quoting Irwin, supra, at 95)).&para;<br>In the case of AEDPA, the presumption’s strength is&para;<br>reinforced by the fact that “ ‘equitable principles’ ” have&para;<br>traditionally “ ‘governed’ ” the substantive law of habeas&para;<br>corpus, Munaf v. Geren, 553 U. S. 674, 693 (2008), for we&para;<br>will “not construe a statute to displace courts’ traditional&para;<br>equitable authority absent the ‘clearest command,’ ” Miller&para;<br>v. French, 530 U. S. 327, 340 (2000) (quoting Califano v.&para;<br>Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 705 (1979)). The presumption’s&para;<br>strength is yet further reinforced by the fact that Congress&para;<br>enacted AEDPA after this Court decided Irwin and there&para;<br>fore was likely aware that courts, when interpreting&para;<br>AEDPA’s timing provisions, would apply the presumption.&para;<br>See, e.g., Merck &amp; Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S. ___, ___&para;<br>(2010) (slip op., at 12).&para;<br>Second, the statute here differs significantly from the&para;<br>statutes at issue in United States v. Brockamp, 519 U. S.&para;<br>347 (1997), and United States v. Beggerly, 524 U. S. 38&para;<br>(1998), two cases in which we held that Irwin’s presump&para;<br>tion had been overcome. In Brockamp, we interpreted a&para;<br>statute of limitations that was silent on the question of&para;<br>equitable tolling as foreclosing application of that doctrine.&para;<br>But in doing so we emphasized that the statute at issue (1)&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLAND v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“se[t] forth its time limitations in unusually emphatic&para;<br>form”; (2) used “highly detailed” and “technical” language&para;<br>“that, linguistically speaking, cannot easily be read as&para;<br>containing implicit exceptions”; (3) “reiterate[d] its limita&para;<br>tions several times in several different ways”; (4) related&para;<br>to an “underlying subject matter,” nationwide tax collec&para;<br>tion, with respect to which the practical consequences of&para;<br>permitting tolling would have been substantial; and (5)&para;<br>would, if tolled, “require tolling, not only procedural limi&para;<br>tations, but also substantive limitations on the amount of&para;<br>recovery—a kind of tolling for which we . . . found no&para;<br>direct precedent.” 519 U. S., at 350–352. And in Beggerly&para;<br>we held that Irwin’s presumption was overcome where (1)&para;<br>the 12-year statute of limitations at issue was “unusually&para;<br>generous” and (2) the underlying claim “deal[t] with own&para;<br>ership of land” and thereby implicated landowners’ need to&para;<br>“know with certainty what their rights are, and the period&para;<br>during which those rights may be subject to challenge.”&para;<br>524 U. S., at 48–49.&para;<br>By way of contrast, AEDPA’s statute of limitations,&para;<br>unlike the statute at issue in Brockamp, does not contain&para;<br>language that is “unusually emphatic,” nor does it “re&para;<br>iterat[e]” its time limitation. Neither would application of&para;<br>equitable tolling here affect the “substance” of a peti&para;<br>tioner’s claim. Moreover, in contrast to the 12-year limita&para;<br>tions period at issue in Beggerly, AEDPA’s limitations&para;<br>period is not particularly long. And unlike the subject&para;<br>matters at issue in both Brockamp and Beggerly—tax&para;<br>collection and land claims—AEDPA’s subject matter,&para;<br>habeas corpus, pertains to an area of the law where equity&para;<br>finds a comfortable home. See Munaf, supra, at 693. In&para;<br>short, AEDPA’s 1-year limit reads like an ordinary, run-of&para;<br>the-mill statute of limitations. See Calderon, supra, at&para;<br>1288.&para;<br>Respondent, citing Brockamp, argues that AEDPA&para;<br>should be interpreted to foreclose equitable tolling because&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the statute sets forth “explicit exceptions to its basic time&para;<br>limits” that do “not include ‘equitable tolling.’ ” 519 U. S.,&para;<br>at 351; see Brief for Respondent 27. The statute does&para;<br>contain multiple provisions relating to the events that&para;<br>trigger its running. See §2244(d)(1); Clay v. United States,&para;<br>537 U. S. 522, 529 (2003); see also Cada v. Baxter Health&para;<br>care Corp., 920 F. 2d 446, 450 (CA7 1990) (“We must . . .&para;<br>distinguish between the accrual of the plaintiff’s claim and&para;<br>the tolling of the statute of limitations . . .”); Wims v.&para;<br>United States, 225 F. 3d 186, 190 (CA2 2000) (same);&para;<br>Wolin v. Smith Barney Inc., 83 F. 3d 847, 852 (CA7 1996)&para;<br>(same). And we concede that it is silent as to equitable&para;<br>tolling while containing one provision that expressly refers&para;<br>to a different kind of tolling. See §2244(d)(2) (stating that&para;<br>“[t]he time during which” a petitioner has a pending re&para;<br>quest for state postconviction relief “shall not be counted&para;<br>toward” his “period of limitation” under AEDPA). But the&para;<br>fact that Congress expressly referred to tolling during&para;<br>state collateral review proceedings is easily explained&para;<br>without rebutting the presumption in favor of equitable&para;<br>tolling. A petitioner cannot bring a federal habeas claim&para;<br>without first exhausting state remedies—a process that&para;<br>frequently takes longer than one year. See Rose v. Lundy,&para;<br>455 U. S. 509 (1982); §2254(b)(1)(A). Hence, Congress had&para;<br>to explain how the limitations statute accounts for the&para;<br>time during which such state proceedings are pending.&para;<br>This special need for an express provision undermines any&para;<br>temptation to invoke the interpretive maxim inclusio&para;<br>unius est exclusio alterius (to include one item (i.e., sus&para;<br>pension during state-court collateral review) is to exclude&para;<br>other similar items (i.e., equitable tolling)). See Young,&para;<br>supra, at 53 (rejecting claim that an “express tolling provi&para;<br>sion, appearing in the same subsection as the [limitations]&para;<br>period, demonstrates a statutory intent not to toll the&para;<br>[limitations] period”).&para;<br>Third, and finally, we disagree with respondent that&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLAND v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>equitable tolling undermines AEDPA’s basic purposes.&para;<br>We recognize that AEDPA seeks to eliminate delays in the&para;<br>federal habeas review process. See Day, 547 U. S., at 205–&para;<br>206; Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322, 337 (2003). But&para;<br>AEDPA seeks to do so without undermining basic habeas&para;<br>corpus principles and while seeking to harmonize the new&para;<br>statute with prior law, under which a petition’s timeliness&para;<br>was always determined under equitable principles. See&para;<br>Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 483 (2000) (“AEDPA’s&para;<br>present provisions . . . incorporate earlier habeas corpus&para;<br>principles”); see also Day, 547 U. S., at 202, n. 1; id., at&para;<br>214 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); 2 R. Hertz &amp; J. Liebman,&para;<br>Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure §24.2, pp.&para;<br>1123–1136 (5th ed. 2005). When Congress codified new&para;<br>rules governing this previously judicially managed area of&para;<br>law, it did so without losing sight of the fact that the “writ&para;<br>of habeas corpus plays a vital role in protecting constitu&para;<br>tional rights.” Slack, 529 U. S., at 483. It did not seek to&para;<br>end every possible delay at all costs. Cf. id., at 483–488.&para;<br>The importance of the Great Writ, the only writ explicitly&para;<br>protected by the Constitution, Art. I, §9, cl. 2, along with&para;<br>congressional efforts to harmonize the new statute with&para;<br>prior law, counsels hesitancy before interpreting AEDPA’s&para;<br>statutory silence as indicating a congressional intent to&para;<br>close courthouse doors that a strong equitable claim would&para;<br>ordinarily keep open.&para;<br>For these reasons we conclude that neither AEDPA’s&para;<br>textual characteristics nor the statute’s basic purposes&para;<br>“rebut” the basic presumption set forth in Irwin. And we&para;<br>therefore join the Courts of Appeals in holding that&para;<br>§2244(d) is subject to equitable tolling.&para;<br>III&para;<br>We have previously made clear that a “petitioner” is&para;<br>“entitled to equitable tolling” only if he shows “(1) that he&para;<br>has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>extraordinary circumstance stood in his way” and pre&para;<br>vented timely filing. Pace, 544 U. S., at 418 (emphasis&para;<br>deleted). In this case, the “extraordinary circumstances”&para;<br>at issue involve an attorney’s failure to satisfy professional&para;<br>standards of care. The Court of Appeals held that, where&para;<br>that is so, even attorney conduct that is “grossly negligent”&para;<br>can never warrant tolling absent “bad faith, dishonesty,&para;<br>divided loyalty, mental impairment or so forth on the&para;<br>lawyer’s part.” 539 F. 3d, at 1339. But in our view, the&para;<br>Court of Appeals’ standard is too rigid.&para;<br>We have said that courts of equity “must be governed by&para;<br>rules and precedents no less than the courts of law.”&para;<br>Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U. S. 314, 323 (1996) (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). But we have also made clear&para;<br>that often the “exercise of a court’s equity powers . . . must&para;<br>be made on a case-by-case basis.” Baggett v. Bullitt, 377&para;<br>U. S. 360, 375 (1964). In emphasizing the need for “flexi&para;<br>bility,” for avoiding “mechanical rules,” Holmberg v. Arm&para;<br>brecht, 327 U. S. 392, 396 (1946), we have followed a tradi&para;<br>tion in which courts of equity have sought to “relieve&para;<br>hardships which, from time to time, arise from a hard and&para;<br>fast adherence” to more absolute legal rules, which, if&para;<br>strictly applied, threaten the “evils of archaic rigidity,”&para;<br>Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U. S.&para;<br>238, 248 (1944). The “flexibility” inherent in “equitable&para;<br>procedure” enables courts “to meet new situations [that]&para;<br>demand equitable intervention, and to accord all the relief&para;<br>necessary to correct . . . particular injustices.” Ibid. (per&para;<br>mitting postdeadline filing of bill of review). Taken to&para;<br>gether, these cases recognize that courts of equity can and&para;<br>do draw upon decisions made in other similar cases for&para;<br>guidance. Such courts exercise judgment in light of prior&para;<br>precedent, but with awareness of the fact that specific&para;<br>circumstances, often hard to predict in advance, could&para;<br>warrant special treatment in an appropriate case.&para;<br>We recognize that, in the context of procedural default,&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLAND v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>we have previously stated, without qualification, that a&para;<br>petitioner “must ‘bear the risk of attorney error.’ ” Cole&para;<br>man v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 752–753 (1991). But&para;<br>Coleman was “a case about federalism,” id., at 726, in that&para;<br>it asked whether federal courts may excuse a petitioner’s&para;<br>failure to comply with a state court’s procedural rules,&para;<br>notwithstanding the state court’s determination that its&para;<br>own rules had been violated. Equitable tolling, by con&para;<br>trast, asks whether federal courts may excuse a peti&para;<br>tioner’s failure to comply with federal timing rules, an&para;<br>inquiry that does not implicate a state court’s interpreta&para;<br>tion of state law.&para;<br>Cf. Lawrence, 549 U. S., at 341&para;<br>(GINSBURG, J., dissenting). Holland does not argue that&para;<br>his attorney’s misconduct provides a substantive ground&para;<br>for relief, cf. §2254(i), nor is this a case that asks whether&para;<br>AEDPA’s statute of limitations should be recognized at all,&para;<br>cf. Day, supra, at 209. Rather, this case asks how equity&para;<br>should be applied once the statute is recognized. And&para;<br>given equity’s resistance to rigid rules, we cannot read&para;<br>Coleman as requiring a per se approach in this context.&para;<br>In short, no pre-existing rule of law or precedent de&para;<br>mands a rule like the one set forth by the Eleventh Circuit&para;<br>in this case. That rule is difficult to reconcile with more&para;<br>general equitable principles in that it fails to recognize&para;<br>that, at least sometimes, professional misconduct that&para;<br>fails to meet the Eleventh Circuit’s standard could none&para;<br>theless amount to egregious behavior and create an ex&para;<br>traordinary circumstance that warrants equitable tolling.&para;<br>And, given the long history of judicial application of equi&para;<br>table tolling, courts can easily find precedents that can&para;<br>guide their judgments. Several lower courts have specifi&para;<br>cally held that unprofessional attorney conduct may, in&para;<br>certain circumstances, prove “egregious” and can be “ex&para;<br>traordinary” even though the conduct in question may not&para;<br>satisfy the Eleventh Circuit’s rule.

But the case before us does not involve, and&para;<br>we are not considering, a “garden variety claim” of attor&para;<br>ney negligence. Rather, the facts of this case present far&para;<br>more serious instances of attorney misconduct. And, as&para;<br>we have said, although the circumstances of a case must&para;<br>be “extraordinary” before equitable tolling can be applied,&para;<br>we hold that such circumstances are not limited to those&para;<br>that satisfy the test that the Court of Appeals used in this&para;<br>case.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>The record facts that we have set forth in Part I of this&para;<br>opinion suggest that this case may well be an “extraordi&para;<br>nary” instance in which petitioner’s attorney’s conduct&para;<br>constituted far more than “garden variety” or “excusable&para;<br>neglect.” To be sure, Collins failed to file Holland’s peti&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLAND v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tion on time and appears to have been unaware of the date&para;<br>on which the limitations period expired—two facts that,&para;<br>alone, might suggest simple negligence. But, in these&para;<br>circumstances, the record facts we have elucidated suggest&para;<br>that the failure amounted to more: Here, Collins failed to&para;<br>file Holland’s federal petition on time despite Holland’s&para;<br>many letters that repeatedly emphasized the importance&para;<br>of his doing so. Collins apparently did not do the research&para;<br>necessary to find out the proper filing date, despite Hol&para;<br>land’s letters that went so far as to identify the applicable&para;<br>legal rules. Collins failed to inform Holland in a timely&para;<br>manner about the crucial fact that the Florida Supreme&para;<br>Court had decided his case, again despite Holland’s many&para;<br>pleas for that information. And Collins failed to communi&para;<br>cate with his client over a period of years, despite various&para;<br>pleas from Holland that Collins respond to his letters.&para;<br>A group of teachers of legal ethics tells us that these&para;<br>various failures violated fundamental canons of profes&para;<br>sional responsibility, which require attorneys to perform&para;<br>reasonably competent legal work, to communicate with&para;<br>their clients, to implement clients’ reasonable requests, to&para;<br>keep their clients informed of key developments in their&para;<br>cases, and never to abandon a client. See Brief for Legal&para;<br>Ethics Professors et al. as Amici Curiae (describing ethical&para;<br>rules set forth in case law, the Restatements of Agency,&para;<br>the Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers&para;<br>(1998), and in the ABA Model Rules of Professional Con&para;<br>duct (2009)). And in this case, the failures seriously preju&para;<br>diced a client who thereby lost what was likely his single&para;<br>opportunity for federal habeas review of the lawfulness of&para;<br>his imprisonment and of his death sentence.&para;<br>We do not state our conclusion in absolute form, how&para;<br>ever, because more proceedings may be necessary. The&para;<br>District Court rested its ruling not on a lack of extraordi&para;<br>nary circumstances, but rather on a lack of diligence—a&para;<br>ruling that respondent does not defend.

We think&para;<br>that the District Court’s conclusion was incorrect. The&para;<br>diligence required for equitable tolling purposes is “ ‘rea&para;<br>sonable diligence,’ ” see, e.g., Lonchar, 517 U. S., at 326,&para;<br>not “ ‘ “maximum feasible diligence,” ’ ” Starns v. Andrews,&para;<br>524 F. 3d 612, 618 (CA5 2008) (quoting Moore v. Knight,&para;<br>368 F. 3d 936, 940 (CA7 2004)). Here, Holland not only&para;<br>wrote his attorney numerous letters seeking crucial in&para;<br>formation and providing direction; he also repeatedly&para;<br>contacted the state courts, their clerks, and the Florida&para;<br>State Bar Association in an effort to have Collins—the&para;<br>central impediment to the pursuit of his legal remedy—&para;<br>removed from his case. And, the very day that Holland&para;<br>discovered that his AEDPA clock had expired due to&para;<br>Collins’ failings, Holland prepared his own habeas petition&para;<br>pro se and promptly filed it with the District Court.&para;<br>Because the District Court erroneously relied on a lack&para;<br>of diligence, and because the Court of Appeals erroneously&para;<br>relied on an overly rigid per se approach, no lower court&para;<br>has yet considered in detail the facts of this case to deter&para;<br>mine whether they indeed constitute extraordinary cir&para;<br>cumstances sufficient to warrant equitable relief.

S. C.&para;<br>§2244(d), is subject to equitable tolling; and second, as&para;<br>suming an affirmative answer to the first question,&para;<br>whether petitioner in this particular case has alleged facts&para;<br>that are sufficient to satisfy the “extraordinary circum&para;<br>stances” prong of the equitable tolling test. I agree with&para;<br>the Court’s conclusion that equitable tolling is available&para;<br>under AEDPA. I also agree with much of the Court’s&para;<br>discussion concerning whether equitable tolling is avail&para;<br>able on the facts of this particular case. In particular, I&para;<br>agree that the Court of Appeals erred by essentially limit&para;<br>ing the relevant inquiry to the question whether “gross&para;<br>negligence” of counsel may be an extraordinary circum&para;<br>stance warranting equitable tolling. As the Court makes&para;<br>clear, petitioner in this case has alleged certain facts that&para;<br>go well beyond any form of attorney negligence, see ante,&para;<br>at 3–4, 19, and the Court of Appeals does not appear to&para;<br>have asked whether those particular facts provide an&para;<br>independent basis for tolling. Accordingly, I concur in the&para;<br>Court’s decision to reverse the judgment below and re&para;<br>mand so that the lower courts may properly apply the&para;<br>correct legal standard.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLAND v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Although I agree that the Court of Appeals applied the&para;<br>wrong standard, I think that the majority does not do&para;<br>enough to explain the right standard. It is of course true&para;<br>that equitable tolling requires “extraordinary circum&para;<br>stances,” but that conclusory formulation does not provide&para;<br>much guidance to lower courts charged with reviewing the&para;<br>many habeas petitions filed every year. I therefore write&para;<br>separately to set forth my understanding of the principles&para;<br>governing the availability of equitable tolling in cases&para;<br>involving attorney misconduct.&para;<br>I&para;<br>“Generally, a litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the&para;<br>burden of establishing two elements: (1) that he has been&para;<br>pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraor&para;<br>dinary circumstance stood in his way.” Pace v. DiGug&para;<br>lielmo, 544 U. S. 408, 418 (2005). The dispute in this case&para;<br>concerns whether and when attorney misconduct amounts&para;<br>to an “extraordinary circumstance” that stands in a peti&para;<br>tioner’s way and prevents the petitioner from filing a&para;<br>timely petition. I agree with the majority that it is not&para;<br>practical to attempt to provide an exhaustive compilation&para;<br>of the kinds of situations in which attorney misconduct&para;<br>may provide a basis for equitable tolling. In my view,&para;<br>however, it is useful to note that several broad principles&para;<br>may be distilled from this Court’s precedents.&para;<br>First, our prior cases make it abundantly clear that&para;<br>attorney negligence is not an extraordinary circumstance&para;<br>warranting equitable tolling. In Lawrence v. Florida, 549&para;<br>U. S. 327, 336 (2007), the Court expressly rejected the&para;<br>petitioner’s contention that “his counsel’s mistake in mis&para;<br>calculating the limitations period entitle[d] him to equita&para;<br>ble tolling.” “Attorney miscalculation,” the Court held, “is&para;<br>simply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling, particu&para;<br>larly in the postconviction context where prisoners have no&para;<br>constitutional right to counsel.” Id., at 336–337 (citing&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 756–757 (1991)&para;<br>(emphasis added)).&para;<br>The basic rationale for Lawrence’s holding is that the&para;<br>mistakes of counsel are constructively attributable to the&para;<br>client, at least in the postconviction context. The Law&para;<br>rence Court’s reliance on Coleman is instructive. In Cole&para;<br>man, the Court addressed whether attorney error provided&para;<br>cause for a procedural default based on a late filing. See&para;<br>501 U. S., at 752. Because “[t]here is no constitutional&para;<br>right to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings,”&para;<br>the Court explained, “a petitioner cannot claim constitu&para;<br>tionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such proceed&para;<br>ings.” Ibid. In such circumstances, the Court reasoned,&para;<br>there was “ ‘no inequity in requiring [the petitioner] to&para;<br>bear the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural&para;<br>default.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478,&para;<br>488 (1986)); accord, Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753 (“ ‘[C]ause’&para;<br>under the cause and prejudice test must be something&para;<br>external to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be&para;<br>attributed to him”); ibid. (“Attorney ignorance or inadver&para;<br>tence is not ‘cause’ because the attorney is the petitioner’s&para;<br>agent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the&para;<br>litigation, and the petitioner must ‘bear the risk of attor&para;<br>ney error’ ”); id., at 754 (what matters is whether “the&para;<br>error [of counsel] must be seen as an external factor, i.e.,&para;<br>‘imputed to the State’ ”); ibid. (“In the absence of a consti&para;<br>tutional violation, the petitioner bears the risk in federal&para;<br>habeas for all attorney errors made in the course of the&para;<br>representation”); id., at 757 (“Because Coleman had no&para;<br>right to counsel to pursue his appeal in state habeas, any&para;<br>attorney error that led to the default of Coleman’s claims&para;<br>in state court cannot constitute cause to excuse the default&para;<br>in federal habeas”). As Lawrence makes clear, the same&para;<br>analysis applies when a petitioner seeks equitable tolling&para;<br>based on attorney error in the postconviction context. See&para;<br>549 U. S., at 336–337 (citing Coleman).&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLAND v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>While Lawrence addressed an allegation of attorney&para;<br>miscalculation, its rationale fully applies to other forms of&para;<br>attorney negligence. Instead of miscalculating the filing&para;<br>deadline, for example, an attorney could compute the&para;<br>deadline correctly but forget to file the habeas petition on&para;<br>time, mail the petition to the wrong address, or fail to do&para;<br>the requisite research to determine the applicable dead&para;<br>line. In any case, however, counsel’s error would be con&para;<br>structively attributable to the client.&para;<br>Second, the mere fact that a missed deadline involves&para;<br>“gross negligence” on the part of counsel does not by itself&para;<br>establish an extraordinary circumstance. As explained&para;<br>above, the principal rationale for disallowing equitable&para;<br>tolling based on ordinary attorney miscalculation is that&para;<br>the error of an attorney is constructively attributable to&para;<br>the client and thus is not a circumstance beyond the liti&para;<br>gant’s control. See Lawrence, supra, at 336–337; Coleman,&para;<br>supra, at 752–754; see also Powell v. Davis, 415 F. 3d 722,&para;<br>727 (CA7 2005); Johnson v. McBride, 381 F. 3d 587, 589–&para;<br>590 (CA7 2004); Harris v. Hutchinson, 209 F. 3d 325, 330&para;<br>(CA4 2000). That rationale plainly applies regardless&para;<br>whether the attorney error in question involves ordinary&para;<br>or gross negligence. See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 754 (“[I]t&para;<br>is not the gravity of the attorney’s error that matters, but&para;<br>that it constitutes a violation of petitioner’s right to coun&para;<br>sel, so that the error must be seen as an external factor,&para;<br>i.e., ‘imputed to the State’ ”); id., at 752 (rejecting the&para;<br>contention that “[t]he late filing was . . . the result of&para;<br>attorney error of sufficient magnitude to excuse the de&para;<br>fault in federal habeas”).&para;<br>Allowing equitable tolling in cases involving gross&para;<br>rather than ordinary attorney negligence would not only&para;<br>fail to make sense in light of our prior cases; it would also&para;<br>be impractical in the extreme. Missing the statute of&para;<br>limitations will generally, if not always, amount to negli&para;<br>gence, see Lawrence, 549 U. S., at 336, and it has been&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>aptly said that gross negligence is ordinary negligence&para;<br>with a vituperative epithet added. Therefore, if gross&para;<br>negligence may be enough for equitable tolling, there will&para;<br>be a basis for arguing that tolling is appropriate in almost&para;<br>every counseled case involving a missed deadline. See&para;<br>ibid. (argument that attorney miscalculation is an ex&para;<br>traordinary circumstance, if credited, “would essentially&para;<br>equitably toll limitations periods for every person whose&para;<br>attorney missed a deadline”). This would not just impose&para;<br>a severe burden on the district courts; it would also make&para;<br>the availability of tolling turn on the highly artificial&para;<br>distinction between gross and ordinary negligence. That&para;<br>line would be hard to administer, would needlessly con&para;<br>sume scarce judicial resources, and would almost certainly&para;<br>yield inconsistent and often unsatisfying results. See&para;<br>Baldayaque v. United States, 338 F. 3d 145, 155 (CA2&para;<br>2003) (Jacobs, J., concurring) (noting that the “distinction&para;<br>between ordinary and extraordinary attorney malpractice&para;<br>. . . is elusive, hard to apply, and counterintuitive”).&para;<br>Finally, it is worth noting that a rule that distinguishes&para;<br>between ordinary and gross attorney negligence for pur&para;<br>poses of the equitable tolling analysis would have demon&para;<br>strably “inequitable” consequences. For example, it is&para;<br>hard to see why a habeas petitioner should be effectively&para;<br>penalized just because his counsel was negligent rather&para;<br>than grossly negligent, or why the State should be penal&para;<br>ized just because petitioner’s counsel was grossly negligent&para;<br>rather than moderately negligent. Regardless of how one&para;<br>characterizes counsel’s deficient performance in such&para;<br>cases, the petitioner is not personally at fault for the&para;<br>untimely filing, attorney error is a but-for cause of the late&para;<br>filing, and the governmental interest in enforcing the&para;<br>statutory limitations period is the same.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Although attorney negligence, however styled, does not&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLLAND v. FLORIDA&para;<br>Opinion of ALITO, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>provide a basis for equitable tolling, the AEDPA statute of&para;<br>limitations may be tolled if the missed deadline results&para;<br>from attorney misconduct that is not constructively at&para;<br>tributable to the petitioner. In this case, petitioner alleges&para;<br>facts that amount to such misconduct. See ante, at 19&para;<br>(acknowledging that ordinary attorney negligence does not&para;<br>warrant equitable tolling, but observing that “the facts of&para;<br>this case present far more serious instances of attorney&para;<br>misconduct”). In particular, he alleges that his attorney&para;<br>essentially “abandoned” him, as evidenced by counsel’s&para;<br>near-total failure to communicate with petitioner or to&para;<br>respond to petitioner’s many inquiries and requests over a&para;<br>period of several years. See ante, at 3–4. Petitioner also&para;<br>appears to allege that he made reasonable efforts to ter&para;<br>minate counsel due to his inadequate representation and&para;<br>to proceed pro se, and that such efforts were successfully&para;<br>opposed by the State on the perverse ground that peti&para;<br>tioner failed to act through appointed counsel. See ante,&para;<br>at 4; Brief for Petitioner 50–51 (stating that petitioner&para;<br>filed “two pro se motions in the Florida Supreme Court to&para;<br>remove Collins as counsel (one which, if granted, would&para;<br>have allowed [petitioner] to proceed pro se)” (emphasis&para;<br>deleted)).&para;<br>If true, petitioner’s allegations would suffice to establish&para;<br>extraordinary circumstances beyond his control. Common&para;<br>sense dictates that a litigant cannot be held constructively&para;<br>responsible for the conduct of an attorney who is not oper&para;<br>ating as his agent in any meaningful sense of that word.&para;<br>See Coleman, supra, at 754 (relying on “well-settled prin&para;<br>ciples of agency law” to determine whether attorney error&para;<br>was attributable to client); Baldayaque, supra, at 154&para;<br>(Jacobs, J., concurring) (“[W]hen an ‘agent acts in a man&para;<br>ner completely adverse to the principal’s interest,’ the&para;<br>‘principal is not charged with [the] agent’s misdeeds’ ”).&para;<br>That is particularly so if the litigant’s reasonable efforts to&para;<br>terminate the attorney’s representation have been&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

The relevant&para;<br>time period extends at most from November 10, 2005—&para;<br>when the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the denial of&para;<br>Holland’s state habeas petition6—to December 15, 2005,&para;<br>the latest date on which §2244(d)’s limitations period&para;<br>could have expired.7 Within that period, Collins could&para;<br>have alerted Holland to the Florida Supreme Court’s&para;<br>decision, and either Collins or Holland himself could have&para;<br>filed a timely federal habeas application. Collins did not&para;<br>do so, but instead filed a petition for certiorari several&para;<br>months later.&para;<br>Why Collins did not notify Holland or file a timely fed&para;<br>eral application for him is unclear, but none of the plausi&para;<br>ble explanations would support equitable tolling. By far&para;<br>the most likely explanation is that Collins made exactly&para;<br>the same mistake as the attorney in Lawrence—i.e., he&para;<br>assumed incorrectly that the pendency of a petition for&para;<br>certiorari in this Court seeking review of the denial of&para;<br>Holland’s state habeas petition would toll AEDPA’s time&para;<br>bar under §2244(d)(2). In December 2002, Collins had&para;<br>explained to Holland by letter that if his state habeas&para;<br>petition was denied and this Court denied certiorari in&para;<br>that proceeding, Holland’s claims “will then be ripe for&para;<br>presentation in a petition for writ of habeas corpus in&para;<br>federal court.” App. 61 (emphasis added).

That misunder&para;<br>standing would entirely account for Collins’s conduct—&para;<br>filing a certiorari petition instead of a habeas application,&para;<br>and waiting nearly three months to do so. But it would&para;<br>also be insufficient, as Lawrence held it was, to warrant&para;<br>tolling.&para;<br>The other conceivable explanations for Collins’s failure&para;<br>fare no better. It may be that Collins believed—as he&para;<br>explained to Holland in a January 2006 letter, after Hol&para;<br>land had informed him that a certiorari petition in a state&para;<br>postconviction proceeding would not stop the clock—that&para;<br>the certiorari petition in Holland’s direct appeal also did&para;<br>not toll the time bar. Consequently, Collins wrote, Hol&para;<br>land’s time to file a federal application had expired even&para;<br>before Collins was appointed. App. 78–79. As the Court&para;<br>explains, ante, at 8, this view too was wrong, but it is no&para;<br>more a basis for equitable tolling than the attorney’s&para;<br>misunderstanding in Lawrence.&para;<br>Or it may be that Collins (despite what he wrote to&para;<br>Holland) correctly understood the rule but simply ne&para;<br>glected to notify Holland; perhaps he missed the state&para;<br>court’s ruling in his mail, or perhaps it simply slipped his&para;<br>mind. Such an oversight is unfortunate, but it amounts to&para;<br>“garden variety” negligence, not a basis for equitable&para;<br>tolling. Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.

But even taken at face value,&para;<br>Collins’s silence prior to November 10, 2005, did not pre&para;<br>vent Holland from filing a timely federal application once&para;<br>the Florida courts were finished with his case. The Court&para;<br>also appears to think significant Collins’s correspondence&para;<br>with Holland in January 2006, after the limitations period&para;<br>had elapsed. Ante, at 5–10, 20. But unless Holland can&para;<br>establish that the time-bar should be tolled due to events&para;<br>before December 15, 2005, any misconduct by Collins after&para;<br>the limitations period elapsed is irrelevant. Even if&para;<br>Collins’s conduct before November 10 and after December&para;<br>15 was “extraordinary,” Holland has not shown that it&para;<br>“stood in his way and prevented timely filing.” Lawrence,&para;<br>549 U.

See 539 F. 3d 1334, 1339 (CA11 2008) (per&para;<br>curiam).8 In any event, the deception of which he com&para;<br>plains consists only of Collins’s assurance early in the&para;<br>representation that he would protect Holland’s ability to&para;<br>assert his claims in federal court, see App. 55, 62, coupled&para;<br>with Collins’s later failure to do so. That, of course, does&para;<br>not by itself amount to deception, and Holland offers no&para;<br>evidence that Collins meant to mislead him.

But&para;<br>the Court never explains why that “or so forth” test, which&para;<br>explicitly leaves room for other kinds of egregious attorney&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The&para;<br>&para;<br>concurrence argues that Holland’s allegations suffice because&para;<br>they show, if true, that Collins “essentially ‘abandoned’ ” Holland by&para;<br>failing to respond to Holland’s inquiries, and therefore ceased to act as&para;<br>Holland’s agent. Ante, at 6 (ALITO, J., concurring in part and concur&para;<br>ring in judgment). But Collins’s failure to communicate has no bearing&para;<br>unless it ended the agency relationship before the relevant window.&para;<br>The concurrence does not explain why it would—does not contend, for&para;<br>example, that Collins’s conduct amounted to disloyalty or renunciation&para;<br>of his role, which would terminate Collins’s authority, see Restatement&para;<br>(Second) of Agency §§112, 118 (1957). Collins’s alleged nonresponsive&para;<br>ness did not help Holland’s cause, but it was no more “adverse to&para;<br>[Holland’s] interest” or “beyond [Holland’s] control,” ante, at 6, 7 (inter&para;<br>nal quotation marks omitted), and thus no more a basis for holding&para;<br>Holland harmless from the consequences of his counsel’s conduct, than&para;<br>mine-run attorney mistakes, cf. Irwin v. Department of Veterans Af&para;<br>fairs, 498 U. S. 89, 96 (1990). The concurrence also relies upon Hol&para;<br>land’s requests to replace Collins with new appointed counsel. But if&para;<br>those requests could prevent imputing Collins’s acts to Holland, every&para;<br>habeas applicant who unsuccessfully asks for a new state-provided&para;<br>lawyer (but who does not seek to proceed pro se when that request is&para;<br>denied) would not be bound by his attorney’s subsequent acts.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

The Court says that “courts can easily find prece&para;<br>dents that can guide their judgments,” ibid., citing several&para;<br>Court of Appeals opinions that (in various contexts) permit&para;<br>tolling for attorney error—but notably omitting opinions&para;<br>that disallow it, such as the Seventh Circuit’s opinion in&para;<br>Powell v.

The Court does not even try to justify importing&para;<br>into equity the “prevailing professional norms” we have&para;<br>held implicit in the right to counsel, Strickland, 466 U.

I object to this transparent attempt to smuggle Strick&para;<br>land into a realm the Sixth Amendment does not reach.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The Court’s refusal to articulate an intelligible rule&para;<br>regarding the only issue actually before us stands in sharp&para;<br>contrast to its insistence on deciding an issue that is not&para;<br>before us: whether Holland satisfied the second prerequi&para;<br>site for equitable tolling by demonstrating that he pursued&para;<br>his rights diligently, see Pace, 544 U. S., at 418–419. As&para;<br>the Court admits, only the District Court addressed that&para;<br>question below; the Eleventh Circuit had no need to reach&para;<br>it. More importantly, it is not even arguably included&para;<br>within the question presented, which concerns only&para;<br>whether an attorney’s gross negligence can constitute an&para;<br>“extraordinary circumstance” of the kind we have held&para;<br>essential for equitable tolling. Pet. for Cert. i. Whether&para;<br>tolling is ever available is fairly included in that question,&para;<br>but whether Holland has overcome an additional, inde&para;<br>pendent hurdle to tolling is not.&para;<br>The Court offers no justification for deciding this dis&para;<br>tinct issue. The closest it comes is its observation that the&para;<br>State “does not defend” the District Court’s ruling regard&para;<br>ing diligence. Ante, at 20.

Nor, contrary to the Court’s&para;<br>implication, has the State conceded the issue. The foot&para;<br>note of the State’s brief which the Court cites did just the&para;<br>opposite: After observing that only the extraordinary&para;<br>circumstance prong of the equitable-tolling test is at issue,&para;<br>the State (perhaps astutely apprehensive that the Court&para;<br>might ignore that fact) added that “to the extent the Court&para;<br>considers the matter” of Holland’s diligence, “Respondent&para;<br>relies on the findings of the district court below.” Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 38, n. 19. The Court also cites a statement by&para;<br>the State’s counsel at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 43,&para;<br>and Holland’s counsel’s characterization of it as a conces&para;<br>sion, id., at 52. But the remark, in context, shows only&para;<br>that the State does not dispute diligence in this Court,&para;<br>where the only issue is extraordinary circumstances:&para;<br>“Well, that goes to the issue . . . of diligence, of course, &para;<br>&para;<br>which is not the issue we’re looking at.

FLORIDA&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>regular basis. And he could have sought permission from&para;<br>the state courts to proceed pro se and thus remove Collins&para;<br>from the equation.10 This is not to say the District Court&para;<br>was correct to conclude Holland was not diligent; but the&para;<br>answer is not as obvious as the Court would make it seem.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The Court’s impulse to intervene when a litigant’s law&para;<br>yer has made mistakes is understandable; the temptation&para;<br>to tinker with technical rules to achieve what appears a&para;<br>just result is often strong, especially when the client faces&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 Holland made many pro se filings in state court (which were&para;<br>stricken because Holland was still represented), and he sought to have&para;<br>new counsel appointed in Collins’s place, but did not seek to proceed&para;<br>pro se. The Court does not dispute this, nor does Holland. The most he&para;<br>asserts is that one of the pro se motions he filed, if granted, would have&para;<br>entitled him to proceed pro se, see Brief for Petitioner 50–51—an&para;<br>assertion he appears not to have made in the District Court, see 1&para;<br>Record, Doc. 35, at 15. The concurrence equates that assertion with an&para;<br>allegation that he actually sought to litigate his case on his own behalf.&para;<br>Ante, at 6. It is not the same. The filing Holland refers to, see Brief for&para;<br>Petitioner 12, and n. 13, like his earlier filings, requested that Collins&para;<br>be replaced by new counsel. App. 149–163. The motion also asked for a&para;<br>hearing pursuant to Nelson v. State, 274 So. 2d 256, 259 (Fla. App.&para;<br>1973), to show Collins’s poor performance, App. 149–150, but that did&para;<br>not amount to a request to proceed pro se. Nelson held that a defendant&para;<br>facing trial who seeks to discharge his court-appointed counsel for&para;<br>ineffectiveness is entitled to a hearing to determine if new counsel is&para;<br>required. 274 So. 2d, at 259. If the defendant fails to make that&para;<br>showing, but “continues to demand a dismissal of his court appointed&para;<br>counsel,” Nelson explained that “a trial judge may in his discretion&para;<br>discharge counsel and require the defendant to proceed to trial without&para;<br>representation by court appointed counsel.” Ibid.; see also Hardwick v.&para;<br>State, 521 So. 2d 1071, 1074–1075 (Fla. 1988). There is no reason why&para;<br>requesting that procedure in state habeas proceedings should be&para;<br>construed as a request to proceed pro se. Holland, unlike a defendant&para;<br>still facing trial, did not need permission to fire Collins, since there was&para;<br>no right to representation to waive. Once his request for a new attor&para;<br>ney was denied, Holland himself could have informed Collins that his&para;<br>services were no longer required.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>SCALIA, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>a capital sentence. But the Constitution does not em&para;<br>power federal courts to rewrite, in the name of equity,&para;<br>rules that Congress has made. Endowing unelected&para;<br>judges with that power is irreconcilable with our system,&para;<br>for it “would literally place the whole rights and property&para;<br>of the community under the arbitrary will of the judge,”&para;<br>arming him with “a despotic and sovereign authority,” 1 J.&para;<br>Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence §19, p. 19&para;<br>(14th ed. 1918). The danger is doubled when we disregard&para;<br>our own precedent, leaving only our own consciences&para;<br>to constrain our discretion. Because both the statute&para;<br>and stare decisis foreclose Holland’s claim, I respectfully&para;<br>dissent.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
