In Reach II, the Compact—&para;<br>recognizing that Louisiana lacks suitable reservoir sites to store water during high flow periods and that the upstream States (Texas,&para;<br>Oklahoma, and Arkansas) were unwilling to release their own stored&para;<br>water for the benefit of a downstream State—granted control over&para;<br>the water in four upstream subbasins (subbasins 1 through 4) to the&para;<br>States in which each subbasin is located and required that water in a&para;<br>fifth subbasin, subbasin 5, be allowed to flow to Louisiana at certain&para;<br>minimum levels. Section 5.05(b)(1) of the Compact gives the States&para;<br>“equal rights” to the use of subbasin 5’s waters when the flow is 3,000&para;<br>cubic feet per second (CFS) or more, “provided no state is entitled to&para;<br>more than 25 percent of the water in excess of 3,000 [CFS].” Under&para;<br>the Compact, States are also entitled to continue with their intrastate water administration.&para;<br>Petitioner Tarrant Regional Water District (Tarrant) is a Texas&para;<br>state agency responsible for providing water to north-central Texas&para;<br>and its rapidly growing population. After unsuccessfully attempting&para;<br>to purchase water from Oklahoma and others, Tarrant sought a water resource permit from the Oklahoma Water Resources Board&para;<br>(OWRB), respondents here, to take surface water from a tributary of&para;<br>the Red River at a point located in Oklahoma’s portion of subbasin 5&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>of Reach II. Knowing that the OWRB would likely deny its permit&para;<br>application because of Oklahoma water laws that effectively prevent&para;<br>out-of-state applicants from taking or diverting water from within&para;<br>Oklahoma’s borders, Tarrant filed suit in federal court simultaneously with its permit application, seeking to enjoin the OWRB’s enforcement of the state statutes on grounds that they were pre-empted by&para;<br>federal law in the form of the Compact and violated the Commerce&para;<br>Clause by discriminating against interstate commerce in water. The&para;<br>District Court granted summary judgment for the OWRB, and the&para;<br>Tenth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held:&para;<br>1. The Compact does not pre-empt the Oklahoma water statutes.&para;<br>Pp. 9–22.&para;<br>(a) Tarrant claims that §5.05(b)(1) creates a borderless common&para;<br>in subbasin 5 in which each of the signatory States may cross each&para;<br>other’s boundaries to access a shared pool of water. Tarrant observes&para;<br>that §5.05(b)(1)’s “equal rights” language grants each State an equal&para;<br>entitlement to subbasin 5’s waters, subject to a 25 percent cap, and&para;<br>argues that its silence concerning state lines indicates that the Compact’s drafters did not intend the provision to allocate water according to state borders. The OWRB counters that §5.05(b)(1)’s “equal&para;<br>rights” afford each State an equal opportunity to use subbasin 5’s excess water within each State’s own borders, but that its silence on&para;<br>cross-border rights indicates that the Compact’s drafters had no intention to create any such rights in the signatory States. Pp. 9–11.&para;<br>(b) Because interstate compacts are construed under contractlaw principles, see Texas v. New Mexico, 482 U. S. 124, 128, the Court&para;<br>begins by examining the Compact’s express terms as the best indication of the parties’ intent. However, §5.05(b)(1)’s silence is, at the&para;<br>very least, ambiguous regarding cross-border rights under the Compact, so the Court turns to other interpretive tools to shed light on&para;<br>the drafters’ intent. Three things persuade the Court that the Compact did not grant cross-border rights: the well-established principle&para;<br>that States do not easily cede their sovereign powers; the fact that&para;<br>other interstate water compacts have treated cross-border rights explicitly; and the parties’ course of dealing. Pp. 11–22.&para;<br>(1) The sovereign States possess an “absolute right to all their&para;<br>navigable waters and the soils under them for their own common&para;<br>use.” Martin v. Lessee of Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, 410. So, for example,&para;<br>“ ‘[a] court deciding a question of title to [a] bed of navigable water&para;<br>[within a State’s boundaries] must . . . begin with a strong presumption’ against defeat of a State’s title.” United States v. Alaska, 521&para;<br>U. S. 1, 34. It follows, then, that “[i]f any inference at all is to be&para;<br>drawn from” silence in compacts touching on the States’ authority to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>control their waters, “it is that each State was left to regulate the activities of her own citizens.” Virginia v. Maryland, 540 U. S. 56, 67.&para;<br>Tarrant contends that §5.05(b)(1)’s silence infers that the signatory&para;<br>States dispensed with the core state prerogative to control water&para;<br>within its borders. But since States rarely relinquish their sovereign&para;<br>powers, the better understanding is that there would be a clear indication of such devolution, not inscrutable silence. Tarrant counters&para;<br>that its interpretation would not intrude on any sovereign prerogative of Oklahoma, which would retain its authority to regulate the&para;<br>water within its borders. But adopting Tarrant’s reading would necessarily entail assuming that Oklahoma and three other States silently surrendered substantial control over their waters when they&para;<br>agreed to the Compact. Pp. 14–16.&para;<br>(2) Looking to the customary practices employed in other interstate compacts also helps in ascertaining the parties’ intent. See,&para;<br>e.g., Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S. 330, ___. Many compacts&para;<br>feature unambiguous language permitting signatory States to cross&para;<br>each other’s borders to fulfill obligations under the compacts, and&para;<br>many provide for the terms and mechanics of how such relationships&para;<br>will operate. The absence of comparable provisions in the Red River&para;<br>Compact strongly suggests that cross-border rights were never intended to be part of the agreement. Tarrant claims that not all interstate compacts have such explicit language, but cites only one such&para;<br>compact, and even it sets out a detailed scheme that would apply to&para;<br>any contemplated diversions. Similarly, even if §2.05(d) of the Compact, which gives “[e]ach Signatory State . . . the right to” “[u]se the&para;<br>bed and banks of the Red River and its tributaries to convey stored&para;<br>water, imported or exported water, and water apportioned according&para;<br>to this Compact,” is read to establish cross-border diversions, it does&para;<br>so through express language, not through an inference from silence.&para;<br>Pp. 16–20.&para;<br>(3) The parties’ conduct under the Compact also undermines&para;<br>Tarrant’s position. See Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S., at ___.&para;<br>Once the Compact was approved in 1980, no signatory State pressed&para;<br>for a cross-border diversion until Tarrant filed suit in 2007. And Tarrant’s earlier offer to purchase water from Oklahoma was a strange&para;<br>decision if Tarrant believed the Compact entitled it to demand water&para;<br>without payment. Nor is there any indication that Tarrant, any other Texas agency, or Texas itself previously made any mention of&para;<br>cross-border rights within the Compact; and none of the other signatory States has ever made such a claim. P. 20.&para;<br>(4) Tarrant’s remaining arguments—that its interpretation is&para;<br>necessary to realize the “structure and purpose of Reach II”; and that&para;<br>§5.05(b)(1)’s 25 percent cap on each State’s access to subbasin 5’s ex-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>cess water implies that if a State cannot access sufficient water within its borders to meet the cap, it must be able to cross borders to&para;<br>reach that water—are unpersuasive. Pp. 20–22.&para;<br>2. The Oklahoma water statutes also do not run afoul of the Commerce Clause. Tarrant claims that the statutes discriminate against&para;<br>interstate commerce by preventing water left unallocated under the&para;<br>Compact from being distributed out of State. But Tarrant’s assumption that some water is left “unallocated” is incorrect. The interpretive comment for Article V of the Compact makes clear that when the&para;<br>flow is above 3,000 CFS, “all states are free to use whatever amount&para;<br>of water they can put to beneficial use,” subject to the requirement&para;<br>that if the amount of available water cannot satisfy all of those uses,&para;<br>“each state will honor the other’s right to 25% of the excess flow.” If&para;<br>more than 25 percent of subbasin 5’s water is located in Oklahoma,&para;<br>that water is not “unallocated”; rather, it is allocated to Oklahoma&para;<br>unless and until another State calls for an accounting and Oklahoma&para;<br>is asked to refrain from utilizing more than its entitled share.&para;<br>Pp. 22–24.&para;<br>&para;<br>656 F. 3d 1222, affirmed.&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

Petitioner Tarrant Regional Water&para;<br>District (Tarrant), a Texas agency, claims that it is entitled to acquire water under the Compact from within&para;<br>Oklahoma and that therefore the Compact pre-empts&para;<br>several Oklahoma statutes that restrict out-of-state diversions of water. In the alternative, Tarrant argues that the&para;<br>Oklahoma laws are unconstitutional restrictions on interstate commerce. We hold that Tarrant’s claims lack merit.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The Red River (or River) begins in the Llano Estacado&para;<br>Mesa on the border between New Mexico and Texas.&para;<br>From this broad plain, it first runs through the Texas&para;<br>Panhandle and then marks the border between Texas and&para;<br>Oklahoma. It continues in an easterly direction until it&para;<br>reaches the shared border with Arkansas. Once the River&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>enters Arkansas, it turns southward and flows into Louisiana, where it empties into the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers.&para;<br>As an important geographic feature of this region, the&para;<br>Red River has lent its name to a valley, a Civil War campaign, and a famed college football rivalry between the&para;<br>Longhorns of Texas and the Sooners of Oklahoma. But&para;<br>college pride has not been the only source of controversy&para;<br>between Texas and Oklahoma regarding the Red River.&para;<br>The River has been the cause of numerous historical conflicts between the two States, leading to a mobilization of&para;<br>their militias at one time, Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S.&para;<br>574, 580 (1922), and the declaration of martial law along a&para;<br>stretch of the River by Oklahoma Governor “Alfalfa Bill”&para;<br>Murray at another, see Okla. H. Res. 1121, 50th Legislature, 2d Sess. (2006) (resolution commemorating “Alfalfa&para;<br>Bill” Murray’s actions during the “Red River Bridge War”).&para;<br>Such disputes over the River and its waters are a natural&para;<br>result of the River’s distribution of water flows. The River’s course means that upstream States like Oklahoma&para;<br>and Texas may appropriate substantial amounts of water&para;<br>from both the River and its tributaries to the disadvantage&para;<br>of downstream States like Arkansas and especially Louisiana, which lacks sufficiently large reservoirs to store&para;<br>water.&para;<br>Absent an agreement among the States, disputes over&para;<br>the allocation of water are subject to equitable apportionment by the courts, Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605,&para;<br>609 (1983), which often results in protracted and costly&para;<br>legal proceedings. Thus in 1955, to forestall future disputes over the River and its water, Congress authorized&para;<br>the States of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas&para;<br>to negotiate a compact to apportion the water of the Red&para;<br>River basin among themselves. See Act of Aug. 11, 1955,&para;<br>Pub. L. 346, 69 Stat. 654. These negotiations lasted over&para;<br>20 years and finally culminated in the signing of the Red&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>River Compact in 1978. Congress approved the Compact&para;<br>in 1980, transforming it into federal law. See Act of Dec.&para;<br>22, 1980, 94 Stat. 3305; Compact, 1 App. 7–51.&para;<br>One of the Compact’s principal purposes was “[t]o provide an equitable apportionment among the Signatory&para;<br>States of the water of the Red River and its tributaries.”&para;<br>§1.01(b), id., at 9. The Compact governs the allocation of&para;<br>water along the Red River and its tributaries from the&para;<br>New Mexico and Texas border to its terminus in Louisiana. §§2.12(a)–(e), id., at 13. This stretch is divided into&para;<br>five separate subdivisions called “Reach[es],” ibid., each of&para;<br>which is further divided into smaller “subbasins,” see, e.g.,&para;<br>§§5.01–5.05, id., at 22–26 (describing subbasins 1 through&para;<br>5 of Reach II). (See Appendix A, infra, for a map.)&para;<br>At issue in this case are rights under the Compact to&para;<br>water located in Oklahoma’s portion of subbasin 5 of&para;<br>Reach II, which occupies “that portion of the Red River,&para;<br>together with its tributaries, from Denison Dam down to&para;<br>the Arkansas-Louisiana state boundary, excluding all&para;<br>tributaries included in the other four subbasins of Reach&para;<br>II.” §5.05(a), 1 App. 24–25. (See Appendix B, infra, for a&para;<br>map.) The Compact’s interpretive comments1 explain that&para;<br>during negotiations, Reach II posed the greatest difficulty&para;<br>to the parties’ efforts to reach agreement. Comment on&para;<br>Art. V, 1 App. 27. The problem was that Louisiana, the&para;<br>farthest downstream State, lacks suitable reservoir sites&para;<br>and therefore cannot store water during high flow periods&para;<br>to meet its future needs. The upstream States (Texas,&para;<br>Oklahoma, and Arkansas), which control the River’s flow,&para;<br>were unwilling to release water stored within their own&para;<br>reservoirs for the benefit of any downstream States, like&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Interpretive&para;<br>&para;<br>comments were included in the Compact so that future&para;<br>readers “might be apprised of the intent of the Compact Negotiation&para;<br>Committee with regard to each Article of the Compact.” Compact,&para;<br>Comment on Preamble, 1 App. 9.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Louisiana. Without any such release, there would be no&para;<br>guaranteed flow of water to Louisiana.&para;<br>The provisions of the Compact relating to Reach II were&para;<br>crafted to address this problem. To this end, Reach II was&para;<br>divided into five subbasins. The upstream subbasins,&para;<br>numbered 1 through 4, were drawn to end at “existing,&para;<br>authorized or proposed last downstream major damsites,”&para;<br>see, e.g., §5.01(a), id., at 22, on the tributaries leading to&para;<br>the Red River before reaching the main stem of the River.&para;<br>These dams allow the parties managing them to control&para;<br>water along the tributaries before it travels farther downstream and joins the flow of the main stem of the River.&para;<br>For the most part, the Compact granted control over the&para;<br>water in these subbasins to the States in which each&para;<br>subbasin is located.2 The remaining subbasin, subbasin 5,&para;<br>instead requires that water be allowed to flow to Louisiana through the main stem of the River at certain minimum levels, assuring Louisiana an allocation of the River’s&para;<br>waters and solving its flowthrough problem.&para;<br>The provision of the Compact central to the present&para;<br>dispute is §5.05(b)(1), which sets the following allocation&para;<br>during times of normal flow:&para;<br>“(1) The Signatory States shall have equal rights to&para;<br>the use of runoff originating in subbasin 5 and un——————&para;<br>2 Within subbasins 1, 2, and 4, water was fully apportioned to a single&para;<br>State. See Compact §5.01(b), id., at 22–23 (apportioning water of&para;<br>subbasin 1 and its “unrestricted use” to Oklahoma); §5.02(b), id., at 23&para;<br>(same for Texas with respect to subbasin 2); §5.04(b), id., at 24 (same&para;<br>for Texas with respect to subbasin 4). Only subbasin 3, which includes&para;<br>portions of Oklahoma and Arkansas, breaks from this pattern and was&para;<br>divided along the lines of a 60-to-40 split, with both States having “free&para;<br>and unrestricted use of the water of this subbasin within their respective states, subject, however, to the limitation that Oklahoma shall&para;<br>allow a quantity of water equal to the 40 percent of the total runoff&para;<br>originating below the following existing, authorized or proposed last&para;<br>major downstream damsites in Oklahoma to flow into Arkansas.”&para;<br>§5.03(b), id., at 23–24.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

V, id., at 30.&para;<br>But if the amount of water above 3,000 CFS cannot satisfy&para;<br>all such uses, then “each state will honor the other’s right&para;<br>to 25% of the excess flow.” Ibid.

This is because the&para;<br>“extensive gaging and record keeping required” to carry&para;<br>out such an accounting would impose “a significant financial burden on the involved states.” Id., at 16. Given&para;<br>these costs, the signatory States did “not envisio[n] that it&para;<br>w[ould] be undertaken as a routine matter.” Ibid. Indeed,&para;<br>it appears that no State has ever asked for such an accounting in the Compact’s history. See Brief for Respondents 45; Reply Brief 11–12.&para;<br>While the Compact allocates water rights among its&para;<br>signatories, it also provides that it should not “be deemed&para;<br>to . . .

From 2000 to 2002, Tarrant, along&para;<br>with several other Texas water districts, offered to purchase water from Oklahoma and the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations. See 2 App. 336–382. But these negotiations&para;<br>were unsuccessful and Tarrant eventually abandoned&para;<br>these efforts.&para;<br>Because Texas’ need for water only continued to grow,&para;<br>Tarrant settled on a new course of action.

HERRMANN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>In Tarrant’s view, this provision essentially creates a&para;<br>borderless common in which each of the four signatory&para;<br>States may cross each other’s boundaries to access a&para;<br>shared pool of water. Tarrant reaches this interpretation&para;<br>in two steps. First, it observes that §5.05(b)(1)’s “equal&para;<br>rights” language grants each State an equal entitlement to&para;<br>the waters of subbasin 5, subject to a 25 percent cap.&para;<br>Second, Tarrant argues §5.05(b)(1)’s silence concerning&para;<br>state lines indicates that the Compact’s drafters did not&para;<br>intend to allocate water according to state borders in this&para;<br>section. According to Tarrant, “the ‘25 percent’ language&para;<br>[of §5.05(b)(1)] makes clear that, in exercising its ‘equal&para;<br>rights’ to the common pool of water, no State may take&para;<br>more than a one-quarter share,” Reply Brief 3, but any of&para;<br>the signatory States may “cross state lines to obtain [its]&para;<br>shar[e] of Subbasin 5 waters,” Brief for Petitioner 32.&para;<br>The OWRB disputes this reading. In its view, the&para;<br>“equal rights” promised by §5.05(b)(1) afford each State an&para;<br>equal opportunity to make use of the excess water within&para;<br>subbasin 5 of Reach II but only within each State’s own&para;<br>borders. This is because the OWRB reads §5.05(b)(1)’s&para;<br>silence differently from Tarrant. The OWRB interprets&para;<br>that provision’s absence of language granting any crossborder rights to indicate that the Compact’s drafters had&para;<br>no intention to create any such rights in the signatory&para;<br>States.&para;<br>Unraveling the meaning of §5.05(b)(1)’s silence with&para;<br>respect to state lines is the key to resolving whether the&para;<br>Compact pre-empts the Oklahoma water statutes.8 If&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 The Compact Clause of the Constitution provides that “[n]o State&para;<br>shall, without the Consent of Congress, . . . enter into any Agreement or&para;<br>Compact with another State.” Art. I, §10, cl. 3. Accordingly, before a&para;<br>compact between two States can be given effect it must be approved by&para;<br>Congress. See Virginia v. Maryland, 540 U. S. 56, 66 (2003). Once a&para;<br>compact receives such approval, it is “transform[ed] . . . into a law of&para;<br>the United States.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

But if §5.05(b)(1)’s&para;<br>silence instead reflects a background understanding on&para;<br>the part of the Compact’s drafters that state borders were&para;<br>to be respected within the Compact’s allocation, then the&para;<br>Oklahoma statutes do not conflict with the Compact’s&para;<br>allocation of water.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Interstate compacts are construed as contracts under&para;<br>the principles of contract law. Texas v. New Mexico, 482&para;<br>U. S. 124, 128 (1987). So, as with any contract, we begin&para;<br>by examining the express terms of the Compact as the&para;<br>best indication of the intent of the parties, see also Montana v. Wyoming, 563 U. S. ___, ___, and n. 4, ___, (2011)&para;<br>(slip op., at 5, and n. 4, 17); Restatement (Second) of Contracts §203(b) (1979).&para;<br>Tarrant argues that because other provisions of the&para;<br>Compact reference state borders, §5.05(b)(1)’s silence with&para;<br>respect to state lines must mean that the Compact’s drafters intended to permit cross-border diversions. For example, §5.03(b), which governs subbasin 3 of Reach II,&para;<br>provides that&para;<br>“[t]he States of Oklahoma and Arkansas shall have&para;<br>free and unrestricted use of the water of this subbasin&para;<br>within their respective states, subject, however, to the&para;<br>limitation that Oklahoma shall allow a quantity of&para;<br>water equal to . . . 40 percent of the total runoff origi——————&para;<br>Supremacy Clause, Art.

Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. De&para;<br>la Cuesta, 458 U. S. 141, 152–153 (1982).&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>nating below the following existing, authorized or&para;<br>proposed last major downstream damsites in Oklahoma to flow into Arkansas.” 1 App. 23–24 (emphasis&para;<br>added).&para;<br>Section 6.03(b), which covers subbasin 3 of Reach III,&para;<br>similarly provides that “Texas and Louisiana within their&para;<br>respective boundaries shall each have the unrestricted use&para;<br>of the water of this subbasin subject to the following&para;<br>[conditions].” Id., at 33 (emphasis added). Thus, §5.03(b)&para;<br>and §6.03(b) mimic §5.05(b)(1) in allocating water rights&para;<br>within a subbasin, but differ in that they make explicit reference to water use “within” state boundaries. Relying on&para;<br>the expressio unius canon of construction, Tarrant finds&para;<br>that §5.05(b)’s silence regarding borders is significant&para;<br>because “ ‘[w]here Congress includes particular language&para;<br>in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of&para;<br>the same Act, it is generally presumed [that] Congress&para;<br>acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion&para;<br>or exclusion.’ ” Brief for Petitioner 29 (quoting Russello v.&para;<br>United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)).&para;<br>But Tarrant’s argument fails to account for other sections of the Compact that cut against its reading. For&para;<br>example, §5.05(b)(3), which governs the waters of subbasin&para;<br>5 in Reach II when flows are below 1,000 CFS, requires&para;<br>that during such periods, Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma&para;<br>allow water “within their respective states to flow into the&para;<br>Red River as required to maintain a 1,000 [CFS] flow at&para;<br>the Arkansas-Louisiana state boundary.” 1 App. 25 (emphasis added). Obviously none of the upstream States can&para;<br>redirect water that lies outside of their borders, so the&para;<br>phrase “within their respective states” is superfluous in&para;<br>§5.05(b)(3). In contrast, §5.05(b)(2), which governs when&para;<br>the River’s flow at the Arkansas-Louisiana border is above&para;<br>1,000 CFS but below 3,000 CFS, requires that upstream&para;<br>States allow a flow to Louisiana equivalent to 40 percent&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of total weekly runoff originating within the subbasin and&para;<br>40 percent of undesignated water flowing into subbasin 5&para;<br>of Reach II. Id., at 25. This language can only refer to&para;<br>water within each State’s borders because otherwise each&para;<br>State would have to contribute 40 percent to the total&para;<br>water flow, which would add up to more than 100 percent.&para;<br>Read together and to avoid absurd results, §§5.05(b)(2)&para;<br>and (3) suggest that each upstream State is individually&para;<br>responsible for ensuring that sufficient subbasin 5 water&para;<br>located within its respective borders flows down to Louisiana, even though §5.05(b)(2) lacks any explicit reference to&para;<br>state lines.&para;<br>Applying Tarrant’s understanding of §5.05(b)(1)’s silence regarding state lines to other of the Compact’s provisions would produce further anomalous results. Consider&para;<br>§6.01(b). That provision states that “Texas is apportioned&para;<br>sixty (60) percent of the runoff of [subbasin 1 of Reach III]&para;<br>and shall have unrestricted use thereof; Arkansas is entitled to forty (40) percent of the runoff of this subbasin.”&para;<br>Id., at 32. Because Texas is upstream from Arkansas,&para;<br>water flows from Texas to Arkansas. Given this situation,&para;<br>the commonsense reason for §6.01(b)’s 60-to-40 allocation&para;<br>is to prevent Texas from barring the flow of water to Arkansas. While there is no reference to state boundaries in&para;<br>the section’s text, the unstated assumption underlying this&para;<br>provision is that Arkansas must wait for its 40 percent&para;<br>share to go through Texas before it can claim it. But&para;<br>applying Tarrant’s understanding of silence regarding&para;<br>state borders to this section would imply that Arkansas&para;<br>could enter into Texas without having to wait for the&para;<br>water that will inevitably reach it. This counterintuitive&para;<br>outcome would thwart the self-evident purposes of the&para;<br>Compact. Further, other provisions of the Compact share&para;<br>this structure of allocating a proportion of water that will&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v.

We therefore turn to other interpretive tools to shed&para;<br>light on the intent of the Compact’s drafters. See Oklahoma v. New Mexico, 501 U. S. 221, 235, n. 5 (1991).10&para;<br>Three things persuade us that cross-border rights were&para;<br>not granted by the Compact: the well-established principle&para;<br>that States do not easily cede their sovereign powers,&para;<br>including their control over waters within their own territories; the fact that other interstate water compacts have&para;<br>treated cross-border rights explicitly; and the parties’&para;<br>course of dealing.&para;<br>1&para;<br>The background notion that a State does not easily cede&para;<br>its sovereignty has informed our interpretation of interstate compacts. We have long understood that as sovereign entities in our federal system, the States possess an&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 See Compact §4.01(b), 1 App. 18 (“The annual flow within this subbasin is hereby apportioned sixty (60) percent to Texas and forty (40)&para;<br>percent to Oklahoma”); §6.02(b), id., at 32 (“Arkansas is apportioned&para;<br>sixty (60) percent of the runoff of this subbasin and shall have unrestricted use thereof; Louisiana is entitled to forty (40) percent of the&para;<br>runoff of this subbasin”).&para;<br>10 There is, however, one interpretive tool that is inapplicable here:&para;<br>the presumption against pre-emption. The Court of Appeals repeatedly&para;<br>referenced and relied upon the presumption in its opinion. See 656&para;<br>F. 3d 1222, 1239, 1242, 1245–1246 (CA10 2011). Yet the presumption&para;<br>against pre-emption is rooted in “respect for the States as ‘independent&para;<br>sovereigns in our federal system’ ” and “assume[s] that ‘Congress does&para;<br>not cavalierly pre-empt’ ” state laws. Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555,&para;<br>565–566, n. 3 (2009). When the States themselves have drafted and&para;<br>agreed to the terms of a compact, and Congress’ role is limited to&para;<br>approving that compact, there is no reason to invoke the presumption.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U.

Lessee&para;<br>of Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, 410 (1842). Drawing on this&para;<br>principle, we have held that ownership of submerged&para;<br>lands, and the accompanying power to control navigation,&para;<br>fishing, and other public uses of water, “is an essential attribute of sovereignty,” United States v. Alaska,&para;<br>521 U. S. 1, 5 (1997). Consequently, “ ‘[a] court deciding&para;<br>a question of title to [a] bed of navigable water [within a&para;<br>State’s boundaries] must . . . begin with a strong presumption’ against defeat of a State’s title.” Id., at 34 (quoting&para;<br>Montana v.

But Tarrant&para;<br>cannot have it both ways. Adopting Tarrant’s reading&para;<br>would necessarily entail assuming that Oklahoma and&para;<br>three other States silently surrendered substantial control&para;<br>over the water within their borders when they agreed to&para;<br>the Compact.

This alone would be a herculean task because the&para;<br>Compact does not require ongoing monitoring or accounting, see Compact §2.11, 1 App. 13, and not all of the water&para;<br>in subbasin 5 is located or originates in Oklahoma. Moreover, the OWRB would be tasked with determining the&para;<br>priority under the Compact of applicants from other&para;<br>States.

First, we are not convinced that a&para;<br>single compact’s failure to reference state borders does&para;<br>much to detract from the overall custom in this area. See&para;<br>supra, at 16–18, and n. 12. Second, the Upper Niobrara&para;<br>River Compact is not a helpful counterexample for Tarrant. The general provision that Tarrant quotes is paired&para;<br>with a host of detailed conditions. See Arts. V(A)1(a)–(f),&para;<br>83 Stat. 88. Contrary to Tarrant’s position, then, assuming that the Upper Niobrara River compact does create&para;<br>any cross-border rights, it does so not through silence, but&para;<br>through the detailed scheme that would apply to any such&para;<br>contemplated diversions.&para;<br>Tarrant also argues that §2.05(d) of the Red River Compact, which provides that “[e]ach Signatory State shall&para;<br>have the right to” “[u]se the bed and banks of the Red&para;<br>River and its tributaries to convey stored water, imported&para;<br>or exported water, and water apportioned according to this&para;<br>Compact,” 1 App. 11, in fact authorizes cross-border diversions. Because the present border between Texas and&para;<br>Oklahoma east of the Texas Panhandle is set by the vegetation line on the south bank of the River, Red River&para;<br>Boundary Compact, 114 Stat. 919, Tarrant contends that&para;<br>§2.05(d) reflects an understanding on the part of the Compact’s drafters that state borders could be crossed. But the&para;<br>issue is not as simple as Tarrant makes it out to be. When&para;<br>the Compact was drafted, the Texas-Oklahoma border was&para;<br>fixed at the south bank of the River. See Texas v. Oklahoma, 457 U. S. 172 (1982). If Texas was able to access&para;<br>water through the south bank of the River—an issue left&para;<br>unbriefed by the parties—the Compact’s framers may&para;<br>have believed that Texas could reach the River and take&para;<br>water from it without having to enter Oklahoman land,&para;<br>casting doubt on Tarrant’s theory. In any event, even if&para;<br>§2.05(d) is read to establish a cross-border right, it does so&para;<br>through express language setting forth the location and&para;<br>purposes under which such an incursion is permissible.&para;<br>&para;<br>20&para;<br>&para;<br>TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>This is different from the inference from silence that&para;<br>Tarrant asks us to draw in §5.05(b)(1).&para;<br>3&para;<br>The parties’ conduct under the Compact also undermines Tarrant’s position. A “part[y’s] course of performance under the Compact is highly significant” evidence&para;<br>of its understanding of the compact’s terms. Alabama v.&para;<br>North Carolina, 560 U. S., at___ (slip op., at 14). Since the&para;<br>Compact was approved by Congress in 1980, no signatory&para;<br>State had pressed for a cross-border diversion under the&para;<br>Compact until Tarrant filed its suit in 2007. Brief for&para;<br>Respondents 26, 49–51. Indeed, Tarrant attempted to&para;<br>purchase water from Oklahoma over the course of 2000&para;<br>until 2002, see supra, at 7, a strange offer if Tarrant believed it was entitled to demand such water without payment under the Compact.&para;<br>In response, Tarrant maintains that there were “compelling business reasons” for it to purchase water. Reply&para;<br>Brief 17. We are unpersuaded. If Tarrant believed that it&para;<br>had a right to water located in Oklahoma, there would&para;<br>have been “compelling business reasons” to mention this&para;<br>right given that billions of dollars were at stake. See 2&para;<br>App. 362–363 (summarizing Texas purchase proposal).&para;<br>Yet there is no indication that Tarrant or any other Texas&para;<br>agency or the State of Texas itself previously made any&para;<br>mention of cross-border rights within the Compact, and&para;<br>none of the other signatory States has ever made such a&para;<br>claim.&para;<br>4&para;<br>The Compact creates no cross-border rights in Texas.&para;<br>Tarrant’s remaining arguments do not persuade us&para;<br>otherwise.&para;<br>First, Tarrant argues that its interpretation of the&para;<br>Compact is necessary to realize the “structure and purpose&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>21&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>of Reach II.” Brief for Petitioner 34–38. Tarrant contends&para;<br>that because the boundary of subbasin 5 is set by the&para;<br>location of the last existing, authorized, or proposed sites&para;<br>for a downstream dam before the Red River, see Compact&para;<br>§§5.01(a), 5.02(a), 5.03(b), 5.04(a), 1 App. 22–24, the Compact allows each of the States upstream from Louisiana to&para;<br>prevent water from flowing from its tributaries into subbasin 5. Tarrant reasons that each State will therefore&para;<br>hold whatever water it needs in its upstream basins.&para;<br>Given this, Tarrant maintains that any water that a State&para;<br>voluntarily allows to reach subbasin 5 must be surplus&para;<br>water that State did not intend to use, and if the upstream&para;<br>State has no need for that water, then there is no reason&para;<br>not to allow other States to access and use it, even across&para;<br>borders.&para;<br>This argument is founded on a shaky premise: It assumes that flows from these dammed-up tributaries are&para;<br>the sole source of water in subbasin 5. But §5.05(b)(1)&para;<br>explains that “[s]ignatory States shall have equal rights to&para;<br>the use of runoff originating in subbasin 5,” as well as&para;<br>“water flowing into subbasin 5,” which would include flows&para;<br>from the main stem of the River itself. Id., at 25. Thus,&para;<br>there are waters that are specific to subbasin 5 separate&para;<br>from those originating in the tributaries covered by subbasins 1 through 4. Tarrant’s account of the purposes of&para;<br>subbasin 5 does not explain how these waters were to be&para;<br>allocated.&para;<br>Tarrant’s second argument regarding the purposes of&para;<br>Reach II is that §5.05(b)(1)’s 25 percent cap on each State’s&para;<br>access to excess water in subbasin 5 should be read to&para;<br>imply that if a State cannot access sufficient water within&para;<br>its borders to meet its share under the cap, then it must be&para;<br>able to cross borders to reach that water. Were it otherwise, Tarrant explains, the 25 percent cap would have no&para;<br>purpose. To support this argument, Tarrant draws on a&para;<br>1970 engineering report that it contends shows that only&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>16 percent of the freshwater flowing into subbasin 5 was&para;<br>located in Texas. Brief for Petitioner 9, n. 5. The OWRB&para;<br>challenges this percentage with its own calculations&para;<br>drawn from the report, and asserts that Texas had access&para;<br>to at least 29 percent of the excess water in subbasin 5&para;<br>within its own borders. Brief for Respondents 26, 47–48,&para;<br>and n. 17.&para;<br>Fortunately, we need not delve into calculations based&para;<br>on a decades-old engineering report to resolve this argument. As we have explained, supra, at 4–6, Texas does not&para;<br>have a minimum guarantee of 25 percent of the excess&para;<br>water in subbasin 5. If it believes that Oklahoma is using&para;<br>more than its 25 percent allotment and wishes to stop it&para;<br>from doing so, then it may call for an accounting under&para;<br>§2.11 of the Compact and, depending on the results of that&para;<br>accounting, insist that Oklahoma desist from taking more&para;<br>than its provided share. See Compact §2.11, and Comment on Art. II, 1 App. 13–16. This is the appropriate&para;<br>remedy provided under the Compact. But Texas has never&para;<br>done so and Tarrant offers no evidence that in the present&para;<br>day Texas cannot access its 25 percent share on its own&para;<br>land.&para;<br>C&para;<br>Under the Compact’s terms, water located within Oklahoma’s portion of subbasin 5 of Reach II remains under&para;<br>Oklahoma’s control. Accordingly, Tarrant’s theory that&para;<br>Oklahoma’s water statutes are pre-empted because they&para;<br>prevent Texas from exercising its rights under the Compact must fail for the reason that the Compact does not&para;<br>create any cross-border rights in signatory States.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Tarrant also challenges the constitutionality of the&para;<br>Oklahoma water statutes under a dormant Commerce&para;<br>Clause theory. Tarrant argues that the Oklahoma water&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>23&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>statutes impermissibly “ ‘discriminat[e] against interstate&para;<br>commerce’ for the ‘forbidden purpose’ of favoring local&para;<br>interests” by erecting barriers to the distribution of water&para;<br>left unallocated under the Compact. Brief for Petitioner&para;<br>47–48 (quoting Department of Revenue of Ky. v. Davis, 553&para;<br>U. S. 328, 338 (2008)). Tarrant’s argument is premised on&para;<br>the position that if we “adopt the Tenth Circuit’s or respondent’s interpretation [of the Compact], . . . a substantial amount of Reach II, Subbasin 5 water located in Oklahoma is not apportioned to any State and therefore is&para;<br>available to permit applicants like Tarrant.” Brief for&para;<br>Petitioner 47. So, Tarrant continues, because Oklahoma’s&para;<br>laws prevent this “unallocated water” from being distributed out of State, those laws violate the Commerce Clause.&para;<br>Tarrant’s assumption that that the Compact leaves&para;<br>some water “unallocated” is incorrect. The interpretive&para;<br>comment for Article V of the Compact makes clear that&para;<br>when the River’s flow is above 3,000 CFS, “all states are&para;<br>free to use whatever amount of water they can put to&para;<br>beneficial use,” subject to the requirement that “[i]f the&para;<br>states have competing uses and the amount of water&para;<br>available in excess of 3000 CFS cannot satisfy all such&para;<br>uses, each state will honor the other’s right to 25% of the&para;<br>excess flow.” 1 App. 29–30. If more than 25 percent of&para;<br>subbasin 5’s water is located in Oklahoma, that water is&para;<br>not “unallocated”; rather, it is allocated to Oklahoma&para;<br>unless and until another State calls for an accounting&para;<br>and Oklahoma is asked to refrain from utilizing more than&para;<br>its entitled share.13 The Oklahoma water statutes cannot discriminate against interstate commerce with respect to unallocated waters because the Compact leaves no&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 Moreover, even if Oklahoma utilized less than 25 percent of the&para;<br>excess subbasin 5 water within its territory and allowed the rest to flow&para;<br>down the River, that water would pass from Reach II into Reach V, see&para;<br>Compact §2.12, 1 App. 13, the waters of which are completely allocated&para;<br>to Louisiana, §8.01, id., at 38. Again, no water is left “unallocated.”&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>waters unallocated. Tarrant’s Commerce Clause argument founders on this point.&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>*&para;<br>The Red River Compact does not pre-empt Oklahoma’s water statutes because the Compact creates no&para;<br>cross-border rights in its signatories for these statutes to&para;<br>infringe.
