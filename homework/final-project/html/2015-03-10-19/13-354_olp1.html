HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC., &para;<br>&para;<br>ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE TENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 13–354.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 25, 2014—Decided June 30, 2014*&para;<br>&para;<br>The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) prohibits the&para;<br>“Government [from] substantially burden[ing] a person’s exercise of&para;<br>religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability” unless the Government “demonstrates that application of the&para;<br>burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering&para;<br>that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U. S. C. §§2000bb–1(a),&para;<br>(b). As amended by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized&para;<br>Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), RFRA covers “any exercise of religion,&para;<br>whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.” §2000cc–5(7)(A).&para;<br>At issue here are regulations promulgated by the Department of&para;<br>Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Patient Protection and&para;<br>Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), which, as relevant here, requires&para;<br>specified employers’ group health plans to furnish “preventive care&para;<br>and screenings” for women without “any cost sharing requirements,”&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §300gg–13(a)(4). Congress did not specify what types of&para;<br>preventive care must be covered; it authorized the Health Resources&para;<br>and Services Administration, a component of HHS, to decide. Ibid.&para;<br>Nonexempt employers are generally required to provide coverage for&para;<br>the 20 contraceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug Admin——————&para;<br>* Together with No. 13–356, Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. et al.&para;<br>v.

HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>istration, including the 4 that may have the effect of preventing an&para;<br>already fertilized egg from developing any further by inhibiting its&para;<br>attachment to the uterus. Religious employers, such as churches, are&para;<br>exempt from this contraceptive mandate. HHS has also effectively&para;<br>exempted religious nonprofit organizations with religious objections&para;<br>to providing coverage for contraceptive services. Under this accommodation, the insurance issuer must exclude contraceptive coverage&para;<br>from the employer’s plan and provide plan participants with separate&para;<br>payments for contraceptive services without imposing any costsharing requirements on the employer, its insurance plan, or its employee beneficiaries.&para;<br>In these cases, the owners of three closely held for-profit corporations have sincere Christian beliefs that life begins at conception and&para;<br>that it would violate their religion to facilitate access to contraceptive&para;<br>drugs or devices that operate after that point. In separate actions,&para;<br>they sued HHS and other federal officials and agencies (collectively&para;<br>HHS) under RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause, seeking to enjoin&para;<br>application of the contraceptive mandate insofar as it requires them&para;<br>to provide health coverage for the four objectionable contraceptives.&para;<br>In No. 13–356, the District Court denied the Hahns and their company—Conestoga Wood Specialties—a preliminary injunction. Affirming, the Third Circuit held that a for-profit corporation could not “engage in religious exercise” under RFRA or the First Amendment, and&para;<br>that the mandate imposed no requirements on the Hahns in their&para;<br>personal capacity. In No. 13–354, the Greens, their children, and&para;<br>their companies—Hobby Lobby Stores and Mardel—were also denied&para;<br>a preliminary injunction, but the Tenth Circuit reversed. It held that&para;<br>the Greens’ businesses are “persons” under RFRA, and that the corporations had established a likelihood of success on their RFRA claim&para;<br>because the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened their exercise of religion and HHS had not demonstrated a compelling interest in enforcing the mandate against them; in the alternative, the&para;<br>court held that HHS had not proved that the mandate was the “least&para;<br>restrictive means” of furthering a compelling governmental interest.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: As applied to closely held corporations, the HHS regulations imposing the contraceptive mandate violate RFRA. Pp. 16–49.&para;<br>(a) RFRA applies to regulations that govern the activities of closely&para;<br>held for-profit corporations like Conestoga, Hobby Lobby, and Mardel. Pp. 16–31.&para;<br>(1) HHS argues that the companies cannot sue because they are&para;<br>for-profit corporations, and that the owners cannot sue because the&para;<br>regulations apply only to the companies, but that would leave merchants with a difficult choice: give up the right to seek judicial protection of their religious liberty or forgo the benefits of operating as cor-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>porations. RFRA’s text shows that Congress designed the statute to&para;<br>provide very broad protection for religious liberty and did not intend&para;<br>to put merchants to such a choice. It employed the familiar legal fiction of including corporations within RFRA’s definition of “persons,”&para;<br>but the purpose of extending rights to corporations is to protect the&para;<br>rights of people associated with the corporation, including shareholders, officers, and employees. Protecting the free-exercise rights of&para;<br>closely held corporations thus protects the religious liberty of the&para;<br>humans who own and control them. Pp. 16–19.&para;<br>(2) HHS and the dissent make several unpersuasive arguments.&para;<br>Pp. 19–31.&para;<br>(i) Nothing in RFRA suggests a congressional intent to depart&para;<br>from the Dictionary Act definition of “person,” which “include[s] corporations, . . . as well as individuals.” 1 U. S. C. §1. The Court has&para;<br>entertained RFRA and free-exercise claims brought by nonprofit corporations. See, e.g., Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficiente União&para;<br>do Vegetal, 546 U. S. 418. And HHS’s concession that a nonprofit&para;<br>corporation can be a “person” under RFRA effectively dispatches any&para;<br>argument that the term does not reach for-profit corporations; no&para;<br>conceivable definition of “person” includes natural persons and nonprofit corporations, but not for-profit corporations. Pp. 19–20.&para;<br>(ii) HHS and the dissent nonetheless argue that RFRA does&para;<br>not cover Conestoga, Hobby Lobby, and Mardel because they cannot&para;<br>“exercise . . . religion.” They offer no persuasive explanation for this&para;<br>conclusion. The corporate form alone cannot explain it because&para;<br>RFRA indisputably protects nonprofit corporations. And the profitmaking objective of the corporations cannot explain it because the&para;<br>Court has entertained the free-exercise claims of individuals who&para;<br>were attempting to make a profit as retail merchants. Braunfeld v.&para;<br>Brown, 366 U. S. 599. Business practices compelled or limited by the&para;<br>tenets of a religious doctrine fall comfortably within the understanding of the “exercise of religion” that this Court set out in Employment&para;<br>Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, 877.&para;<br>Any suggestion that for-profit corporations are incapable of exercising religion because their purpose is simply to make money flies in&para;<br>the face of modern corporate law. States, including those in which&para;<br>the plaintiff corporations were incorporated, authorize corporations&para;<br>to pursue any lawful purpose or business, including the pursuit of&para;<br>profit in conformity with the owners’ religious principles. Pp. 20–25.&para;<br>(iii) Also flawed is the claim that RFRA offers no protection because it only codified pre-Smith Free Exercise Clause precedents,&para;<br>none of which squarely recognized free-exercise rights for for-profit&para;<br>corporations. First, nothing in RFRA as originally enacted suggested&para;<br>that its definition of “exercise of religion” was meant to be tied to pre-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>Smith interpretations of the First Amendment. Second, if RFRA’s&para;<br>original text were not clear enough, the RLUIPA amendment surely&para;<br>dispels any doubt that Congress intended to separate the definition of&para;<br>the phrase from that in First Amendment case law. Third, the preSmith case of Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Super Market of Mass., Inc.,&para;<br>366 U. S. 617, suggests, if anything, that for-profit corporations can&para;<br>exercise religion. Finally, the results would be absurd if RFRA, a law&para;<br>enacted to provide very broad protection for religious liberty, merely&para;<br>restored this Court’s pre-Smith decisions in ossified form and restricted RFRA claims to plaintiffs who fell within a category of plaintiffs whose claims the Court had recognized before Smith. Pp. 25–28.&para;<br>(3) Finally, HHS contends that Congress could not have wanted&para;<br>RFRA to apply to for-profit corporations because of the difficulty of&para;<br>ascertaining the “beliefs” of large, publicly traded corporations, but&para;<br>HHS has not pointed to any example of a publicly traded corporation&para;<br>asserting RFRA rights, and numerous practical restraints would likely prevent that from occurring. HHS has also provided no evidence&para;<br>that the purported problem of determining the sincerity of an asserted religious belief moved Congress to exclude for-profit corporations&para;<br>from RFRA’s protection. That disputes among the owners of corporations might arise is not a problem unique to this context. State corporate law provides a ready means for resolving any conflicts by, for&para;<br>example, dictating how a corporation can establish its governing&para;<br>structure. Courts will turn to that structure and the underlying state&para;<br>law in resolving disputes. Pp. 29–31.&para;<br>(b) HHS’s contraceptive mandate substantially burdens the exercise of religion. Pp. 31–38.&para;<br>(1) It requires the Hahns and Greens to engage in conduct that&para;<br>seriously violates their sincere religious belief that life begins at conception. If they and their companies refuse to provide contraceptive&para;<br>coverage, they face severe economic consequences: about $475 million&para;<br>per year for Hobby Lobby, $33 million per year for Conestoga, and&para;<br>$15 million per year for Mardel. And if they drop coverage altogether, they could face penalties of roughly $26 million for Hobby Lobby,&para;<br>$1.8 million for Conestoga, and $800,000 for Mardel. P. 32.&para;<br>(2) Amici supporting HHS argue that the $2,000 per-employee&para;<br>penalty is less than the average cost of providing insurance, and&para;<br>therefore that dropping insurance coverage eliminates any substantial burden imposed by the mandate. HHS has never argued this and&para;<br>the Court does not know its position with respect to the argument.&para;<br>But even if the Court reached the argument, it would find it unpersuasive: It ignores the fact that the plaintiffs have religious reasons&para;<br>for providing health-insurance coverage for their employees, and it is&para;<br>far from clear that the net cost to the companies of providing insur-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ance is more than the cost of dropping their insurance plans and paying the ACA penalty. Pp. 32–35.&para;<br>(3) HHS argues that the connection between what the objecting&para;<br>parties must do and the end that they find to be morally wrong is too&para;<br>attenuated because it is the employee who will choose the coverage&para;<br>and contraceptive method she uses. But RFRA’s question is whether&para;<br>the mandate imposes a substantial burden on the objecting parties’&para;<br>ability to conduct business in accordance with their religious beliefs.&para;<br>The belief of the Hahns and Greens implicates a difficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy, namely, the circumstances under which it is immoral for a person to perform an act&para;<br>that is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by another. It is not for the&para;<br>Court to say that the religious beliefs of the plaintiffs are mistaken or&para;<br>unreasonable. In fact, this Court considered and rejected a nearly&para;<br>identical argument in Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment&para;<br>Security Div., 450 U. S. 707. The Court’s “narrow function . . . is to&para;<br>determine” whether the plaintiffs’ asserted religious belief reflects&para;<br>“an honest conviction,” id., at 716, and there is no dispute here that it&para;<br>does. Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 689; and Board of Ed. of&para;<br>Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236, 248–249, distinguished. Pp. 35–38.&para;<br>(c) The Court assumes that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free&para;<br>access to the four challenged contraceptive methods is a compelling&para;<br>governmental interest, but the Government has failed to show that&para;<br>the contraceptive mandate is the least restrictive means of furthering&para;<br>that interest. Pp. 38–49.&para;<br>(1) The Court assumes that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free&para;<br>access to the four challenged contraceptive methods is compelling&para;<br>within the meaning of RFRA. Pp. 39–40.&para;<br>(2) The Government has failed to satisfy RFRA’s leastrestrictive-means standard. HHS has not shown that it lacks other&para;<br>means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial&para;<br>burden on the exercise of religion. The Government could, e.g., assume the cost of providing the four contraceptives to women unable&para;<br>to obtain coverage due to their employers’ religious objections. Or it&para;<br>could extend the accommodation that HHS has already established&para;<br>for religious nonprofit organizations to non-profit employers with religious objections to the contraceptive mandate. That accommodation&para;<br>does not impinge on the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs that providing insurance coverage for the contraceptives at issue here violates their&para;<br>religion and it still serves HHS’s stated interests. Pp. 40–45.&para;<br>(3) This decision concerns only the contraceptive mandate and&para;<br>should not be understood to hold that all insurance-coverage man-&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>dates, e.g., for vaccinations or blood transfusions, must necessarily&para;<br>fall if they conflict with an employer’s religious beliefs. Nor does it&para;<br>provide a shield for employers who might cloak illegal discrimination&para;<br>as a religious practice. United States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252, which upheld the payment of Social Security taxes despite an employer’s religious objection, is not analogous. It turned primarily on the special&para;<br>problems associated with a national system of taxation; and if Lee&para;<br>were a RFRA case, the fundamental point would still be that there is&para;<br>no less restrictive alternative to the categorical requirement to pay&para;<br>taxes. Here, there is an alternative to the contraceptive mandate.&para;<br>Pp. 45–49.&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 13–354, 723 F. 3d 1114, affirmed; No. 13–356, 724 F. 3d 377, reversed and remanded.&para;<br>ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

We hold that the regulations that&para;<br>impose this obligation violate RFRA, which prohibits the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Federal Government from taking any action that substantially burdens the exercise of religion unless that action&para;<br>constitutes the least restrictive means of serving a compelling government interest.&para;<br>In holding that the HHS mandate is unlawful, we reject&para;<br>HHS’s argument that the owners of the companies forfeited all RFRA protection when they decided to organize&para;<br>their businesses as corporations rather than sole proprietorships or general partnerships. The plain terms of&para;<br>RFRA make it perfectly clear that Congress did not discriminate in this way against men and women who wish to&para;<br>run their businesses as for-profit corporations in the manner required by their religious beliefs.&para;<br>Since RFRA applies in these cases, we must decide&para;<br>whether the challenged HHS regulations substantially&para;<br>burden the exercise of religion, and we hold that they do.&para;<br>The owners of the businesses have religious objections to&para;<br>abortion, and according to their religious beliefs the four&para;<br>contraceptive methods at issue are abortifacients. If the&para;<br>owners comply with the HHS mandate, they believe they&para;<br>will be facilitating abortions, and if they do not comply,&para;<br>they will pay a very heavy price—as much as $1.3 million&para;<br>per day, or about $475 million per year, in the case of one&para;<br>of the companies. If these consequences do not amount to&para;<br>a substantial burden, it is hard to see what would.&para;<br>Under RFRA, a Government action that imposes a&para;<br>substantial burden on religious exercise must serve a&para;<br>compelling government interest, and we assume that the&para;<br>HHS regulations satisfy this requirement. But in order&para;<br>for the HHS mandate to be sustained, it must also constitute the least restrictive means of serving that interest,&para;<br>and the mandate plainly fails that test. There are other&para;<br>ways in which Congress or HHS could equally ensure that&para;<br>every woman has cost-free access to the particular contraceptives at issue here and, indeed, to all FDA-approved&para;<br>contraceptives.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>In fact, HHS has already devised and implemented a&para;<br>system that seeks to respect the religious liberty of religious nonprofit corporations while ensuring that the employees of these entities have precisely the same access to&para;<br>all FDA-approved contraceptives as employees of companies whose owners have no religious objections to providing such coverage. The employees of these religious nonprofit corporations still have access to insurance coverage&para;<br>without cost sharing for all FDA-approved contraceptives; and according to HHS, this system imposes no net&para;<br>economic burden on the insurance companies that are&para;<br>required to provide or secure the coverage.&para;<br>Although HHS has made this system available to religious nonprofits that have religious objections to the contraceptive mandate, HHS has provided no reason why the&para;<br>same system cannot be made available when the owners of&para;<br>for-profit corporations have similar religious objections.&para;<br>We therefore conclude that this system constitutes an&para;<br>alternative that achieves all of the Government’s aims&para;<br>while providing greater respect for religious liberty. And&para;<br>under RFRA, that conclusion means that enforcement of&para;<br>the HHS contraceptive mandate against the objecting&para;<br>parties in these cases is unlawful.&para;<br>As this description of our reasoning shows, our holding&para;<br>is very specific. We do not hold, as the principal dissent&para;<br>alleges, that for-profit corporations and other commercial&para;<br>enterprises can “opt out of any law (saving only tax laws)&para;<br>they judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious&para;<br>beliefs.” Post, at 1 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). Nor do we&para;<br>hold, as the dissent implies, that such corporations have&para;<br>free rein to take steps that impose “disadvantages . . . on&para;<br>others” or that require “the general public [to] pick up the&para;<br>tab.” Post, at 1–2. And we certainly do not hold or suggest&para;<br>that “RFRA demands accommodation of a for-profit corporation’s religious beliefs no matter the impact that accommodation may have on . . . thousands of women em-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BURWELL v.

Under that accommodation,&para;<br>these women would still be entitled to all FDA-approved&para;<br>contraceptives without cost sharing.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress enacted RFRA in 1993 in order to provide very&para;<br>broad protection for religious liberty. RFRA’s enactment&para;<br>came three years after this Court’s decision in Employ­&para;<br>ment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494&para;<br>U. S. 872 (1990), which largely repudiated the method of&para;<br>analyzing free-exercise claims that had been used in cases&para;<br>like Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963), and Wiscon­&para;<br>sin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205 (1972). In determining whether&para;<br>challenged government actions violated the Free Exercise&para;<br>Clause of the First Amendment, those decisions used a&para;<br>balancing test that took into account whether the challenged action imposed a substantial burden on the practice of religion, and if it did, whether it was needed to&para;<br>serve a compelling government interest. Applying this&para;<br>test, the Court held in Sherbert that an employee who was&para;<br>fired for refusing to work on her Sabbath could not be&para;<br>denied unemployment benefits. 374 U. S., at 408–409.&para;<br>And in Yoder, the Court held that Amish children could&para;<br>not be required to comply with a state law demanding that&para;<br>they remain in school until the age of 16 even though their&para;<br>religion required them to focus on uniquely Amish values&para;<br>and beliefs during their formative adolescent years. 406&para;<br>U. S., at 210–211, 234–236.&para;<br>In Smith, however, the Court rejected “the balancing&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 See also post, at 8 (“The exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and&para;<br>Conestoga . . . would deny [their employees] access to contraceptive&para;<br>coverage that the ACA would otherwise secure”)&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>test set forth in Sherbert.” 494 U. S., at 883. Smith concerned two members of the Native American Church who&para;<br>were fired for ingesting peyote for sacramental purposes.&para;<br>When they sought unemployment benefits, the State of&para;<br>Oregon rejected their claims on the ground that consumption of peyote was a crime, but the Oregon Supreme Court,&para;<br>applying the Sherbert test, held that the denial of benefits&para;<br>violated the Free Exercise Clause. 494 U. S., at 875.&para;<br>This Court then reversed, observing that use of the&para;<br>Sherbert test whenever a person objected on religious&para;<br>grounds to the enforcement of a generally applicable law&para;<br>“would open the prospect of constitutionally required&para;<br>religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every&para;<br>conceivable kind.” 494 U. S., at 888. The Court therefore&para;<br>held that, under the First Amendment, “neutral, generally&para;<br>applicable laws may be applied to religious practices even&para;<br>when not supported by a compelling governmental interest.” City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 514 (1997).&para;<br>Congress responded to Smith by enacting RFRA.&para;<br>“[L]aws [that are] ‘neutral’ toward religion,” Congress&para;<br>found, “may burden religious exercise as surely as laws&para;<br>intended to interfere with religious exercise.” 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2000bb(a)(2); see also §2000bb(a)(4). In order to ensure&para;<br>broad protection for religious liberty, RFRA provides that&para;<br>“Government shall not substantially burden a person’s&para;<br>exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule&para;<br>of general applicability.” §2000bb–1(a).2 If the Government substantially burdens a person’s exercise of religion,&para;<br>under the Act that person is entitled to an exemption from&para;<br>the rule unless the Government “demonstrates that application of the burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of&para;<br>a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least&para;<br>restrictive means of furthering that compelling govern——————&para;<br>2 The Act defines “government” to include any “department” or&para;<br>“agency” of the United States. §2000bb–2(1).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BURWELL v.

As applied to a federal agency, RFRA is based on&para;<br>the enumerated power that supports the particular agency’s work,4 but in attempting to regulate the States and&para;<br>their subdivisions, Congress relied on its power under&para;<br>Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce the&para;<br>First Amendment. 521 U. S., at 516–517. In City of&para;<br>Boerne, however, we held that Congress had overstepped&para;<br>its Section 5 authority because “[t]he stringent test RFRA&para;<br>demands” “far exceed[ed] any pattern or practice of unconstitutional conduct under the Free Exercise Clause as&para;<br>interpreted in Smith.” Id., at 533–534. See also id., at&para;<br>532.&para;<br>Following our decision in City of Boerne, Congress&para;<br>passed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized&para;<br>Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 114 Stat. 803, 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§2000cc et seq. That statute, enacted under Congress’s&para;<br>Commerce and Spending Clause powers, imposes the&para;<br>same general test as RFRA but on a more limited category&para;<br>of governmental actions.

Under this rule of construction, the phrase&para;<br>“exercise of religion,” as it appears in RLUIPA, must be interpreted&para;<br>broadly, and RFRA states that the same phrase, as used in RFRA,&para;<br>means “religious exercis[e] as defined in [RLUIPA].” 42 U.

And if the employer decides to stop&para;<br>providing health insurance altogether and at least one&para;<br>full-time employee enrolls in a health plan and qualifies&para;<br>for a subsidy on one of the government-run ACA exchanges,&para;<br>the employer must pay $2,000 per year for each of its fulltime employees. §§4980H(a), (c)(1).&para;<br>Unless an exception applies, ACA requires an employer’s group health plan or group-health-insurance coverage&para;<br>to furnish “preventive care and screenings” for women&para;<br>without “any cost sharing requirements.” 42 U.

A corporation is simply a form of organization&para;<br>used by human beings to achieve desired ends. An established body of law specifies the rights and obligations of&para;<br>the people (including shareholders, officers, and employees) who are associated with a corporation in one way or&para;<br>another. When rights, whether constitutional or statutory, are extended to corporations, the purpose is to protect&para;<br>the rights of these people. For example, extending Fourth&para;<br>Amendment protection to corporations protects the privacy&para;<br>interests of employees and others associated with the&para;<br>company. Protecting corporations from government seizure of their property without just compensation protects&para;<br>all those who have a stake in the corporations’ financial&para;<br>well-being. And protecting the free-exercise rights of&para;<br>corporations like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel&para;<br>protects the religious liberty of the humans who own and&para;<br>control those companies.&para;<br>In holding that Conestoga, as a “secular, for-profit corporation,” lacks RFRA protection, the Third Circuit wrote&para;<br>as follows:&para;<br>“General business corporations do not, separate and&para;<br>apart from the actions or belief systems of their indi­&para;<br>vidual owners or employees, exercise religion. They do&para;<br>not pray, worship, observe sacraments or take other&para;<br>religiously-motivated actions separate and apart from&para;<br>the intention and direction of their individual actors.”&para;<br>724 F. 3d, at 385 (emphasis added).&para;<br>All of this is true—but quite beside the point.

S. C. §§2000bb–1(a), (b), and RFRA&para;<br>itself does not define the term “person.” We therefore look&para;<br>to the Dictionary Act, which we must consult “[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the&para;<br>context indicates otherwise.” 1 U. S. C. §1.&para;<br>Under the Dictionary Act, “the wor[d] ‘person’ . . . include[s] corporations, companies, associations, firms,&para;<br>partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well&para;<br>as individuals.” Ibid.; see FCC v. AT&amp;T Inc., 562 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6) (“We have no doubt that&para;<br>‘person,’ in a legal setting, often refers to artificial entities.&para;<br>The Dictionary Act makes that clear”). Thus, unless there&para;<br>is something about the RFRA context that “indicates&para;<br>otherwise,” the Dictionary Act provides a quick, clear, and&para;<br>affirmative answer to the question whether the companies&para;<br>involved in these cases may be heard.&para;<br>We see nothing in RFRA that suggests a congressional&para;<br>intent to depart from the Dictionary Act definition, and&para;<br>HHS makes little effort to argue otherwise. We have&para;<br>entertained RFRA and free-exercise claims brought by&para;<br>nonprofit corporations, see Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita&para;<br>Beneficiente União do Vegetal, 546 U.

No&para;<br>known understanding of the term “person” includes some&para;<br>but not all corporations. The term “person” sometimes&para;<br>encompasses artificial persons (as the Dictionary Act&para;<br>instructs), and it sometimes is limited to natural persons.&para;<br>But no conceivable definition of the term includes natural&para;<br>persons and nonprofit corporations, but not for-profit&para;<br>corporations.20 Cf.

Neither HHS nor the dissent, however, provides any&para;<br>persuasive explanation for this conclusion.&para;<br>Is it because of the corporate form?

The dissent suggests that nonprofit&para;<br>corporations are special because furthering their religious “autonomy . . . often furthers individual religious&para;<br>freedom as well.” Post, at 15 (quoting Corporation of&para;<br>Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day&para;<br>Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 342 (1987) (Brennan, J.,&para;<br>concurring in judgment)). But this principle applies&para;<br>equally to for-profit corporations: Furthering their religious freedom also “furthers individual religious freedom.”&para;<br>In these cases, for example, allowing Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel to assert RFRA claims protects the&para;<br>religious liberty of the Greens and the Hahns.21&para;<br>If the corporate form is not enough, what about the&para;<br>profit-making objective? In Braunfeld, 366 U. S. 599, we&para;<br>entertained the free-exercise claims of individuals who&para;<br>were attempting to make a profit as retail merchants, and&para;<br>the Court never even hinted that this objective precluded&para;<br>their claims. As the Court explained in a later case, the&para;<br>“exercise of religion” involves “not only belief and profession but the performance of (or abstention from) physical&para;<br>acts” that are “engaged in for religious reasons.” Smith,&para;<br>494 U. S., at 877. Business practices that are compelled or&para;<br>limited by the tenets of a religious doctrine fall comfortably within that definition. Thus, a law that “operates so&para;<br>as to make the practice of . . . religious beliefs more expensive” in the context of business activities imposes a burden&para;<br>on the exercise of religion. Braunfeld, supra, at 605; see&para;<br>United States v. Lee, 455 U.

See post, at 19 (dismissing the relevance of Braunfeld in part&para;<br>because “[t]he free exercise claim asserted there was promptly rejected&para;<br>on the merits”).&para;<br>23 See, e.g., 724 F. 3d, at 385 (“We do not see how a for-profit, ‘artificial being,’ . . . that was created to make money” could exercise religion); Grote v. Sebelius, 708 F. 3d 850, 857 (CA7 2013) (Rovner, J.&para;<br>dissenting) (“So far as it appears, the mission of Grote Industries, like&para;<br>that of any other for-profit, secular business, is to make money in the&para;<br>commercial sphere”); Autocam Corp. v.

J., dissenting)&para;<br>(“[T]he specific purpose for which [a corporation] is created matters&para;<br>greatly to how it will be categorized and treated under the law” and “it&para;<br>is undisputed that Hobby Lobby and Mardel are for-profit corporations&para;<br>focused on selling merchandise to consumers”).&para;<br>The principal dissent makes a similar point, stating that “[f]or-profit&para;<br>corporations are different from religious nonprofits in that they use&para;<br>labor to make a profit, rather than to perpetuate the religious values&para;<br>shared by a community of believers.” Post, at 18–19 (internal quotation&para;<br>marks omitted). The first half of this statement is a tautology; forprofit corporations do indeed differ from nonprofits insofar as they seek&para;<br>to make a profit for their owners, but the second part is factually&para;<br>untrue. As the activities of the for-profit corporations involved in these&para;<br>cases show, some for-profit corporations do seek “to perpetuate the&para;<br>religious values shared,” in these cases, by their owners. Conestoga’s&para;<br>Vision and Values Statement declares that the company is dedicated to&para;<br>operating “in [a] manner that reflects our Christian heritage and the&para;<br>highest ethical and moral principles of business.” App. in No. 13–356,&para;<br>p. 94.

Hazen, Treatise of the Law of Corporations §4:1,&para;<br>p. 224 (3d ed. 2010) (emphasis added); see 1A W. Fletcher,&para;<br>Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations §102 (rev. ed. 2010).&para;<br>While it is certainly true that a central objective of forprofit corporations is to make money, modern corporate&para;<br>law does not require for-profit corporations to pursue&para;<br>profit at the expense of everything else, and many do not&para;<br>do so. For-profit corporations, with ownership approval,&para;<br>support a wide variety of charitable causes, and it is not at&para;<br>all uncommon for such corporations to further humanitarian and other altruistic objectives. Many examples come&para;<br>readily to mind. So long as its owners agree, a for-profit&para;<br>corporation may take costly pollution-control and energyconservation measures that go beyond what the law requires. A for-profit corporation that operates facilities in&para;<br>other countries may exceed the requirements of local law&para;<br>regarding working conditions and benefits. If for-profit&para;<br>corporations may pursue such worthy objectives, there is&para;<br>no apparent reason why they may not further religious&para;<br>objectives as well.&para;<br>HHS would draw a sharp line between nonprofit corpo——————&para;<br>operating . . . in a manner consistent with Biblical principles.” App. in&para;<br>No. 13–354, p. 135. The dissent also believes that history is not on our&para;<br>side because even Blackstone recognized the distinction between&para;<br>“ecclesiastical and lay” corporations. Post, at 18. What Blackstone&para;<br>illustrates, however, is that dating back to 1765, there was no sharp&para;<br>divide among corporations in their capacity to exercise religion; Blackstone recognized that even what he termed “lay” corporations might&para;<br>serve “the promotion of piety.” 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the&para;<br>Law of England 458–459 (1765). And whatever may have been the case&para;<br>at the time of Blackstone, modern corporate law (and the law of the&para;<br>States in which these three companies are incorporated) allows forprofit corporations to “perpetuat[e] religious values.”&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>BURWELL v.

This argument has many&para;<br>flaws.&para;<br>First, nothing in the text of RFRA as originally enacted&para;<br>suggested that the statutory phrase “exercise of religion&para;<br>under the First Amendment” was meant to be tied to this&para;<br>Court’s pre-Smith interpretation of that Amendment.&para;<br>When first enacted, RFRA defined the “exercise of religion” to mean “the exercise of religion under the First&para;<br>Amendment”—not the exercise of religion as recognized&para;<br>only by then-existing Supreme Court precedents. 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §2000bb–2(4) (1994 ed.). When Congress wants to&para;<br>link the meaning of a statutory provision to a body of this&para;<br>Court’s case law, it knows how to do so. See, e.g., Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28&para;<br>&para;<br>26&para;<br>&para;<br>BURWELL v. HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) (authorizing habeas relief from a&para;<br>state-court decision that “was contrary to, or involved an&para;<br>unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal&para;<br>law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United&para;<br>States”).&para;<br>Second, if the original text of RFRA was not clear&para;<br>enough on this point—and we think it was—the amendment of RFRA through RLUIPA surely dispels any doubt.&para;<br>That amendment deleted the prior reference to the First&para;<br>Amendment, see 42 U. S. C. §2000bb–2(4) (2000 ed.) (incorporating §2000cc–5), and neither HHS nor the principal&para;<br>dissent can explain why Congress did this if it wanted to&para;<br>tie RFRA coverage tightly to the specific holdings of our&para;<br>pre-Smith free-exercise cases. Moreover, as discussed, the&para;<br>amendment went further, providing that the exercise of&para;<br>religion “shall be construed in favor of a broad protection&para;<br>of religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by&para;<br>the terms of this chapter and the Constitution.” §2000cc–&para;<br>3(g). It is simply not possible to read these provisions as&para;<br>restricting the concept of the “exercise of religion” to those&para;<br>practices specifically addressed in our pre-Smith decisions.&para;<br>Third, the one pre-Smith case involving the free-exercise&para;<br>rights of a for-profit corporation suggests, if anything, that&para;<br>for-profit corporations possess such rights. In Gallagher v.&para;<br>Crown Kosher Super Market of Mass., Inc., 366 U. S. 617&para;<br>(1961), the Massachusetts Sunday closing law was challenged by a kosher market that was organized as a forprofit corporation, by customers of the market, and by a&para;<br>rabbi. The Commonwealth argued that the corporation&para;<br>lacked “standing” to assert a free-exercise claim,26 but not&para;<br>one member of the Court expressed agreement with that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>26 See&para;<br>&para;<br>Brief for Appellants in Gallagher, O. T. 1960 No. 11, pp. 16, 28–&para;<br>31 (arguing that corporation “has no ‘religious belief’ or ‘religious&para;<br>liberty,’ and had no standing in court to assert that its free exercise of&para;<br>religion was impaired”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

The plurality opinion for four Justices rejected&para;<br>the First Amendment claim on the merits based on the&para;<br>reasoning in Braunfeld, and reserved decision on the&para;<br>question whether the corporation had “standing” to raise&para;<br>the claim. See 366 U. S., at 631. The three dissenters,&para;<br>Justices Douglas, Brennan, and Stewart, found the law&para;<br>unconstitutional as applied to the corporation and the&para;<br>other challengers and thus implicitly recognized their&para;<br>right to assert a free-exercise claim. See id., at 642 (Brennan, J., joined by Stewart, J., dissenting); McGowan v.&para;<br>Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 578–579 (1961) (Douglas, J.,&para;<br>dissenting as to related cases including Gallagher). Finally, Justice Frankfurter’s opinion, which was joined by&para;<br>Justice Harlan, upheld the Massachusetts law on the&para;<br>merits but did not question or reserve decision on the&para;<br>issue of the right of the corporation or any of the other&para;<br>challengers to be heard. See McGowan, 366 U. S., at 521–&para;<br>522. It is quite a stretch to argue that RFRA, a law enacted&para;<br>to provide very broad protection for religious liberty,&para;<br>left for-profit corporations unprotected simply because in&para;<br>Gallagher—the only pre-Smith case in which the issue&para;<br>was raised—a majority of the Justices did not find it necessary to decide whether the kosher market’s corporate&para;<br>status barred it from raising a free-exercise claim.&para;<br>Finally, the results would be absurd if RFRA merely&para;<br>restored this Court’s pre-Smith decisions in ossified form&para;<br>and did not allow a plaintiff to raise a RFRA claim unless&para;<br>that plaintiff fell within a category of plaintiffs one of&para;<br>whom had brought a free-exercise claim that this Court&para;<br>entertained in the years before Smith. For example, we&para;<br>are not aware of any pre-Smith case in which this Court&para;<br>entertained a free-exercise claim brought by a resident&para;<br>noncitizen.

HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>gument, both HHS and the principal dissent fall back on&para;<br>the broader contention that the Nation lacks a tradition of&para;<br>exempting for-profit corporations from generally applicable laws. By contrast, HHS contends, statutes like Title&para;<br>VII, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–19(A), expressly exempt churches&para;<br>and other nonprofit religious institutions but not for-profit&para;<br>corporations. See Brief for HHS in No. 13–356, p. 26. In&para;<br>making this argument, however, HHS did not call to our&para;<br>attention the fact that some federal statutes do exempt&para;<br>categories of entities that include for-profit corporations&para;<br>from laws that would otherwise require these entities to&para;<br>engage in activities to which they object on grounds of&para;<br>conscience. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. §300a–7(b)(2); §238n(a).27&para;<br>If Title VII and similar laws show anything, it is&para;<br>that Congress speaks with specificity when it intends a&para;<br>religious accommodation not to extend to for-profit&para;<br>corporations.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>27 The principal dissent points out that “the exemption codified in&para;<br>§238n(a) was not enacted until three years after RFRA’s passage.”&para;<br>Post, at 16, n. 15. The dissent takes this to mean that RFRA did not, in&para;<br>fact, “ope[n] all statutory schemes to religion-based challenges by forprofit corporations” because if it had “there would be no need for a&para;<br>statute-specific, post-RFRA exemption of this sort.” Ibid.&para;<br>This argument fails to recognize that the protection provided by&para;<br>§238n(a) differs significantly from the protection provided by RFRA.&para;<br>Section 238n(a) flatly prohibits discrimination against a covered&para;<br>healthcare facility for refusing to engage in certain activities related to&para;<br>abortion. If a covered healthcare facility challenged such discrimination under RFRA, by contrast, the discrimination would be unlawful&para;<br>only if a court concluded, among other things, that there was a less&para;<br>restrictive means of achieving any compelling government interest.&para;<br>In addition, the dissent’s argument proves too much. Section&para;<br>238n(a) applies evenly to “any health care entity”—whether it is a&para;<br>religious nonprofit entity or a for-profit entity. There is no dispute that&para;<br>RFRA protects religious nonprofit corporations, so if §238n(a) were&para;<br>redundant as applied to for-profit corporations, it would be equally&para;<br>redundant as applied to nonprofits.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>29&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>Finally, HHS contends that Congress could not have&para;<br>wanted RFRA to apply to for-profit corporations because it&para;<br>is difficult as a practical matter to ascertain the sincere&para;<br>“beliefs” of a corporation. HHS goes so far as to raise the&para;<br>specter of “divisive, polarizing proxy battles over the religious identity of large, publicly traded corporations such&para;<br>as IBM or General Electric.” Brief for HHS in No. 13–356,&para;<br>at 30.&para;<br>These cases, however, do not involve publicly traded&para;<br>corporations, and it seems unlikely that the sort of corporate giants to which HHS refers will often assert RFRA&para;<br>claims. HHS has not pointed to any example of a publicly&para;<br>traded corporation asserting RFRA rights, and numerous&para;<br>practical restraints would likely prevent that from occurring. For example, the idea that unrelated shareholders—&para;<br>including institutional investors with their own set of&para;<br>stakeholders—would agree to run a corporation under the&para;<br>same religious beliefs seems improbable. In any event, we&para;<br>have no occasion in these cases to consider RFRA’s applicability to such companies. The companies in the cases&para;<br>before us are closely held corporations, each owned and&para;<br>controlled by members of a single family, and no one has&para;<br>disputed the sincerity of their religious beliefs.28&para;<br>HHS has also provided no evidence that the purported&para;<br>problem of determining the sincerity of an asserted religious belief moved Congress to exclude for-profit corporations from RFRA’s protection. On the contrary, the scope&para;<br>of RLUIPA shows that Congress was confident of the&para;<br>ability of the federal courts to weed out insincere claims.&para;<br>RLUIPA applies to “institutionalized persons,” a category&para;<br>——————&para;<br>28 To&para;<br>&para;<br>qualify for RFRA’s protection, an asserted belief must be “sincere”; a corporation’s pretextual assertion of a religious belief in order&para;<br>to obtain an exemption for financial reasons would fail.

And if, as HHS seems to concede, Congress wanted&para;<br>RFRA to apply to nonprofit corporations, see, Reply Brief&para;<br>in No. 13–354, at 7–8, what reason is there to think that&para;<br>Congress believed that spotting insincere claims would&para;<br>be tougher in cases involving for-profits?&para;<br>HHS and the principal dissent express concern about&para;<br>the possibility of disputes among the owners of corporations, but that is not a problem that arises because of&para;<br>RFRA or that is unique to this context.

We have little trouble concluding that it does.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>30 The&para;<br>&para;<br>principal dissent attaches significance to the fact that the&para;<br>“Senate voted down [a] so-called ‘conscience amendment,’ which would&para;<br>have enabled any employer or insurance provider to deny coverage&para;<br>based on its asserted religious beliefs or moral convictions.” Post, at 6.&para;<br>The dissent would evidently glean from that vote an intent by the&para;<br>Senate to prohibit for-profit corporate employers from refusing to offer&para;<br>contraceptive coverage for religious reasons, regardless of whether the&para;<br>contraceptive mandate could pass muster under RFRA’s standards.&para;<br>But that is not the only plausible inference from the failed amendment—or even the most likely. For one thing, the text of the amendment was “written so broadly that it would allow any employer to deny&para;<br>any health service to any American for virtually any reason—not just&para;<br>for religious objections.” 158 Cong. Rec. S1165 (Mar. 1, 2012) (emphasis&para;<br>added). Moreover, the amendment would have authorized a blanket&para;<br>exemption for religious or moral objectors; it would not have subjected&para;<br>religious-based objections to the judicial scrutiny called for by RFRA, in&para;<br>which a court must consider not only the burden of a requirement on&para;<br>religious adherents, but also the government’s interest and how narrowly tailored the requirement is. It is thus perfectly reasonable to&para;<br>believe that the amendment was voted down because it extended more&para;<br>broadly than the pre-existing protections of RFRA. And in any event,&para;<br>even if a rejected amendment to a bill could be relevant in other contexts, it surely cannot be relevant here, because any “Federal statutory&para;<br>law adopted after November 16, 1993 is subject to [RFRA] unless such&para;<br>law explicitly excludes such application by reference to [RFRA].” 42&para;<br>U.

These sums are&para;<br>surely substantial.&para;<br>It is true that the plaintiffs could avoid these assessments by dropping insurance coverage altogether and thus&para;<br>forcing their employees to obtain health insurance on one&para;<br>of the exchanges established under ACA. But if at least&para;<br>one of their full-time employees were to qualify for a subsidy on one of the government-run exchanges, this course&para;<br>would also entail substantial economic consequences.

The Hahns and&para;<br>Greens believe that providing the coverage demanded by&para;<br>the HHS regulations is connected to the destruction of an&para;<br>embryo in a way that is sufficient to make it immoral for&para;<br>them to provide the coverage.

But in those cases, while the subsidies&para;<br>were clearly contrary to the challengers’ views on a secular issue, namely, proper church-state relations, the challengers never articulated a religious objection to the subsidies. As we put it in Tilton, they were “unable to&para;<br>identify any coercion directed at the practice or exercise of&para;<br>their religious beliefs.” 403 U. S., at 689 (plurality opinion); see Allen, supra, at 249 (“[A]ppellants have not contended that the New York law in any way coerces them as&para;<br>individuals in the practice of their religion”). Here, in&para;<br>contrast, the plaintiffs do assert that funding the specific&para;<br>contraceptive methods at issue violates their religious&para;<br>beliefs, and HHS does not question their sincerity. Because the contraceptive mandate forces them to pay an&para;<br>enormous sum of money—as much as $475 million per&para;<br>year in the case of Hobby Lobby—if they insist on providing insurance coverage in accordance with their religious&para;<br>beliefs, the mandate clearly imposes a substantial burden&para;<br>on those beliefs.&para;<br>V&para;<br>Since the HHS contraceptive mandate imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion, we must move&para;<br>on and decide whether HHS has shown that the mandate&para;<br>both “(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental&para;<br>interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” 42 U.

That consideration will often inform the analysis&para;<br>of the Government’s compelling interest and the availability of a less&para;<br>restrictive means of advancing that interest. But it could not reasonably be maintained that any burden on religious exercise, no matter how&para;<br>onerous and no matter how readily the government interest could be&para;<br>achieved through alternative means, is permissible under RFRA so long&para;<br>as the relevant legal obligation requires the religious adherent to confer&para;<br>a benefit on third parties. Otherwise, for example, the Government&para;<br>could decide that all supermarkets must sell alcohol for the convenience&para;<br>of customers (and thereby exclude Muslims with religious objections&para;<br>from owning supermarkets), or it could decide that all restaurants must&para;<br>remain open on Saturdays to give employees an opportunity to earn&para;<br>tips (and thereby exclude Jews with religious objections from owning&para;<br>restaurants). By framing any Government regulation as benefiting a&para;<br>third party, the Government could turn all regulations into entitlements to which nobody could object on religious grounds, rendering&para;<br>RFRA meaningless. In any event, our decision in these cases need not&para;<br>result in any detrimental effect on any third party. As we explain, see&para;<br>infra, at 43–44, the Government can readily arrange for other methods&para;<br>of providing contraceptives, without cost sharing, to employees who are&para;<br>unable to obtain them under their health-insurance plans due to their&para;<br>employers’ religious objections.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

Cf. §2000cc–3(c) (RLUIPA: “[T]his chapter may&para;<br>require a government to incur expenses in its own operations to avoid imposing a substantial burden on religious&para;<br>exercise.”).

HHS itself has demonstrated that it has at its disposal an approach that is less restrictive than requiring&para;<br>employers to fund contraceptive methods that violate their&para;<br>religious beliefs.

HHS analogizes the contraceptive mandate to the requirement to pay Social Security taxes,&para;<br>which we upheld in Lee despite the religious objection of&para;<br>an employer, but these cases are quite different. Our&para;<br>holding in Lee turned primarily on the special problems&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 573 U.

We noted&para;<br>that “[t]he obligation to pay the social security tax initially&para;<br>is not fundamentally different from the obligation to pay&para;<br>income taxes.” 455 U. S., at 260. Based on that premise,&para;<br>we explained that it was untenable to allow individuals to&para;<br>seek exemptions from taxes based on religious objections&para;<br>to particular Government expenditures: “If, for example, a&para;<br>religious adherent believes war is a sin, and if a certain&para;<br>percentage of the federal budget can be identified as devoted to war-related activities, such individuals would&para;<br>have a similarly valid claim to be exempt from paying that&para;<br>percentage of the income tax.” Ibid. We observed that&para;<br>“[t]he tax system could not function if denominations were&para;<br>allowed to challenge the tax system because tax payments&para;<br>were spent in a manner that violates their religious belief.” Ibid.; see O Centro, 546 U.

Because of the enormous variety of government expenditures funded by tax dollars, allowing taxpayers to withhold a portion of their tax obligations on&para;<br>religious grounds would lead to chaos.&para;<br>Recognizing&para;<br>exemptions from the contraceptive mandate is very different. ACA does not create a large national pool of tax&para;<br>revenue for use in purchasing healthcare coverage.

The dissent worries about forcing the federal courts to apply RFRA to a host of claims&para;<br>made by litigants seeking a religious exemption from&para;<br>generally applicable laws, and the dissent expresses a&para;<br>desire to keep the courts out of this business. See post, at&para;<br>32–35. In making this plea, the dissent reiterates a point&para;<br>made forcefully by the Court in Smith. 494 U. S., at 888–&para;<br>889 (applying the Sherbert test to all free-exercise claims&para;<br>“would open the prospect of constitutionally required&para;<br>religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every&para;<br>conceivable kind”).

The wisdom of Congress’s judgment on this&para;<br>——————&para;<br>43 HHS&para;<br>&para;<br>highlights certain statements in the opinion in Lee that it&para;<br>regards as supporting its position in these cases.

It means, too, the right&para;<br>to express those beliefs and to establish one’s religious&para;<br>(or nonreligious) self-definition in the political, civic, and&para;<br>economic life of our larger community. But in a complex&para;<br>society and an era of pervasive governmental regulation,&para;<br>defining the proper realm for free exercise can be difficult.&para;<br>In these cases the plaintiffs deem it necessary to exercise&para;<br>their religious beliefs within the context of their own&para;<br>closely held, for-profit corporations.

That&para;<br>framework is one that HHS has itself devised, that the&para;<br>plaintiffs have not criticized with a specific objection that&para;<br>has been considered in detail by the courts in this litigation, and that is less restrictive than the means challenged&para;<br>by the plaintiffs in these cases.

See ante, at 6, n. 3, 7,&para;<br>17, 25–27. To support its conception of RFRA as a measure detached from this Court’s decisions, one that sets a&para;<br>new course, the Court points first to the Religious Land&para;<br>Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA),&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §2000cc et seq., which altered RFRA’s definition of the term “exercise of religion.” RFRA, as originally&para;<br>enacted, defined that term to mean “the exercise of religion under the First Amendment to the Constitution.”&para;<br>§2000bb–2(4) (1994 ed.). See ante, at 6–7. As amended by&para;<br>RLUIPA, RFRA’s definition now includes “any exercise of&para;<br>religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a&para;<br>system of religious belief.” §2000bb–2(4) (2012 ed.) (crossreferencing §2000cc–5). That definitional change, according to the Court, reflects “an obvious effort to effect a&para;<br>complete separation from First Amendment case law.”&para;<br>Ante, at 7.&para;<br>The Court’s reading is not plausible. RLUIPA’s alteration clarifies that courts should not question the centrality&para;<br>of a particular religious exercise. But the amendment in&para;<br>no way suggests that Congress meant to expand the class&para;<br>of entities qualified to mount religious accommodation&para;<br>claims, nor does it relieve courts of the obligation to inquire whether a government action substantially burdens&para;<br>a religious exercise. See Rasul v.

But as RFRA’s statements of purpose and legislative&para;<br>history make clear, Congress intended only to restore, not&para;<br>to scrap or alter, the balancing test as this Court had&para;<br>applied it pre-Smith. See supra, at 8–9. See also Senate&para;<br>Report 9 (RFRA’s “compelling interest test generally&para;<br>should not be construed more stringently or more leniently&para;<br>than it was prior to Smith.”); House Report 7 (same).&para;<br>The Congress that passed RFRA correctly read this&para;<br>Court’s pre-Smith case law as including within the “compelling interest test” a “least restrictive means” requirement.

It can scarcely be maintained that RFRA enlarges these exemptions to allow Hobby Lobby and Conestoga to hire only persons who&para;<br>share the religious beliefs of the Greens or Hahns.

The Court’s inference is unwarranted. The exemptions the&para;<br>Court cites cover certain medical personnel who object to performing or&para;<br>assisting with abortions.

Notably, the Court does not assert that these exemptions have&para;<br>in fact been afforded to for-profit corporations. See §238n(c) (“health&para;<br>care entity” covered by exemption is a term defined to include “an&para;<br>individual physician, a postgraduate physician training program, and a&para;<br>participant in a program of training in the health professions”); Tozzi,&para;<br>Whither Free Exercise: Employment Division v.

These provisions are revealing in a way that detracts from one of the Court’s main arguments.&para;<br>They show that Congress is not content to rest on the Dictionary Act&para;<br>when it wishes to ensure that particular entities are among those&para;<br>eligible for a religious accommodation.&para;<br>Moreover, the exemption codified in §238n(a) was not enacted until&para;<br>three years after RFRA’s passage. See Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996, §515, 110 Stat. 1321–245. If, as&para;<br>the Court believes, RFRA opened all statutory schemes to religionbased challenges by for-profit corporations, there would be no need for a&para;<br>statute-specific, post-RFRA exemption of this sort.&para;<br>16 That is not to say that a category of plaintiffs, such as resident&para;<br>aliens, may bring RFRA claims only if this Court expressly “addressed&para;<br>their [free-exercise] rights before Smith.” Ante, at 27.

See Brief for Petitioners in No. 13–&para;<br>356, p. 64. A tax credit, of course, is one variety of “let the&para;<br>government pay.” In addition to departing from the existing employer-based system of health insurance, Conestoga’s alternative would require a woman to reach into her&para;<br>own pocket in the first instance, and it would do nothing&para;<br>for the woman too poor to be aided by a tax credit.&para;<br>In sum, in view of what Congress sought to accomplish,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>27 On&para;<br>&para;<br>brief, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga barely addressed the extension solution, which would bracket commercial enterprises with nonprofit religion-based organizations for religious accommodations purposes. The hesitation is understandable, for challenges to the adequacy&para;<br>of the accommodation accorded religious nonprofit organizations are&para;<br>currently sub judice.

Lee, 455 U. S. 252 (1982).&para;<br>Lee, a sole proprietor engaged in farming and carpentry,&para;<br>was a member of the Old Order Amish. He sincerely&para;<br>believed that withholding Social Security taxes from his&para;<br>employees or paying the employer’s share of such taxes&para;<br>would violate the Amish faith. This Court held that,&para;<br>although the obligations imposed by the Social Security&para;<br>system conflicted with Lee’s religious beliefs, the burden&para;<br>was not unconstitutional. Id., at 260–261. See also id., at&para;<br>258 (recognizing the important governmental interest in&para;<br>providing a “nationwide . . . comprehensive insurance&para;<br>system with a variety of benefits available to all participants, with costs shared by employers and employees”).28&para;<br>The Government urges that Lee should control the challenges brought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga. See Brief&para;<br>for Respondents in No. 13–356, p. 18. In contrast, today’s&para;<br>Court dismisses Lee as a tax case. See ante, at 46–47.&para;<br>Indeed, it was a tax case and the Court in Lee homed in on&para;<br>“[t]he difficulty in attempting to accommodate religious&para;<br>beliefs in the area of taxation.” 455 U. S., at 259.&para;<br>But the Lee Court made two key points one cannot&para;<br>confine to tax cases. “When followers of a particular sect&para;<br>enter into commercial activity as a matter of choice,” the&para;<br>Court observed, “the limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be&para;<br>——————&para;<br>28 As&para;<br>&para;<br>a sole proprietor, Lee was subject to personal liability for violating the law of general application he opposed. His claim to a religionbased exemption would have been even thinner had he conducted his&para;<br>business as a corporation, thus avoiding personal liability.&para;<br>&para;<br>32&para;<br>&para;<br>BURWELL v.

The statutory scheme&para;<br>of employer-based comprehensive health coverage involved in these cases is surely binding on others engaged&para;<br>in the same trade or business as the corporate challengers&para;<br>here, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga. Further, the Court&para;<br>recognized in Lee that allowing a religion-based exemption&para;<br>to a commercial employer would “operat[e] to impose the&para;<br>employer’s religious faith on the employees.” Ibid.29 No&para;<br>doubt the Greens and Hahns and all who share their&para;<br>beliefs may decline to acquire for themselves the contraceptives in question. But that choice may not be imposed&para;<br>on employees who hold other beliefs. Working for Hobby&para;<br>Lobby or Conestoga, in other words, should not deprive&para;<br>employees of the preventive care available to workers at&para;<br>the shop next door,30 at least in the absence of directions&para;<br>from the Legislature or Administration to do so.&para;<br>Why should decisions of this order be made by Congress&para;<br>or the regulatory authority, and not this Court? Hobby&para;<br>Lobby and Conestoga surely do not stand alone as commercial enterprises seeking exemptions from generally&para;<br>applicable laws on the basis of their religious beliefs. See,&para;<br>e.g., Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 256 F. Supp.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>29 Congress&para;<br>&para;<br>amended the Social Security Act in response to Lee. The&para;<br>amended statute permits Amish sole proprietors and partnerships (but&para;<br>not Amish-owned corporations) to obtain an exemption from the obligation to pay Social Security taxes only for employees who are coreligionists and who likewise seek an exemption and agree to give up&para;<br>their Social Security benefits. See 26 U. S. C. §3127(a)(2), (b)(1). Thus,&para;<br>employers with sincere religious beliefs have no right to a religionbased exemption that would deprive employees of Social Security&para;<br>benefits without the employee’s consent—an exemption analogous to&para;<br>the one Hobby Lobby and Conestoga seek here.&para;<br>30 Cf.

Not much help there for the lower courts bound by&para;<br>today’s decision.&para;<br>The Court, however, sees nothing to worry about. Today’s cases, the Court concludes, are “concerned solely&para;<br>with the contraceptive mandate. Our decision should not&para;<br>be understood to hold that an insurance-coverage mandate&para;<br>must necessarily fall if it conflicts with an employer’s&para;<br>religious beliefs. Other coverage requirements, such as&para;<br>immunizations, may be supported by different interests&para;<br>(for example, the need to combat the spread of infectious&para;<br>diseases) and may involve different arguments about the&para;<br>least restrictive means of providing them.” Ante, at 46.&para;<br>But the Court has assumed, for RFRA purposes, that the&para;<br>interest in women’s health and well being is compelling&para;<br>and has come up with no means adequate to serve that&para;<br>interest, the one motivating Congress to adopt the Women’s Health Amendment.&para;<br>There is an overriding interest, I believe, in keeping the&para;<br>courts “out of the business of evaluating the relative merits of differing religious claims,” Lee, 455 U. S., at 263, n. 2&para;<br>(Stevens, J., concurring in judgment), or the sincerity with&para;<br>which an asserted religious belief is held. Indeed, approving some religious claims while deeming others unworthy&para;<br>of accommodation could be “perceived as favoring one&para;<br>religion over another,” the very “risk the Establishment&para;<br>Clause was designed to preclude.” Ibid.
