Argued February 28, 2011—Decided June 6, 2011&para;<br>In 1985, a small California research company called Cetus began to&para;<br>develop methods for quantifying blood-borne levels of human immu&para;<br>nodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. A Nobel Prize&para;<br>winning technique developed at Cetus known as PCR was an integral&para;<br>part of these efforts.&para;<br>In 1988, Cetus began to collaborate with scientists at Stanford&para;<br>University’s Department of Infectious Diseases to test the efficacy of&para;<br>new AIDS drugs. Dr. Holodniy joined Stanford as a research fellow&para;<br>in the department around that time. When he did so, he signed an&para;<br>agreement stating that he “agree[d] to assign” to Stanford his “right,&para;<br>title and interest in” inventions resulting from his employment there.&para;<br>Holodniy’s supervisor arranged for him to conduct research at Cetus&para;<br>to learn about PCR. As a condition of gaining access to Cetus,&para;<br>Holodniy was required to sign an agreement stating that he “will as&para;<br>sign and do[es] hereby assign” to Cetus his “right, title and interest&para;<br>in . . . the ideas, inventions, and improvements” made “as a conse&para;<br>quence of [his] access” to Cetus. Working with Cetus employees,&para;<br>Holodniy devised a PCR-based procedure for measuring the amount&para;<br>of HIV in a patient’s blood. Upon returning to Stanford, he and other&para;<br>Stanford employees tested the procedure. Stanford secured three&para;<br>patents to the measurement process.&para;<br>Roche Molecular Systems acquired Cetus’s PCR-related assets.&para;<br>After conducting clinical trials on the HIV quantification method de&para;<br>veloped at Cetus, Roche commercialized the procedure. Today, its&para;<br>HIV test kits are used worldwide.&para;<br>The University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act of 1980&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR &para;<br>&para;<br>UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>(Bayh-Dole Act or Act) allocates rights in federally funded “subject&para;<br>invention[s]” between the Federal Government and federal contrac&para;<br>tors. 35 U. S. C. §§201(e), (c), 202(a). The Act defines “subject inven&para;<br>tion” as “any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually&para;<br>reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding&para;<br>agreement,” §201(e), and provides that contractors may “elect to re&para;<br>tain title to any subject invention,” §202(a). Because some of Stan&para;<br>ford’s research on the HIV measurement technique was funded by&para;<br>the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Bayh-Dole Act applied.&para;<br>In accordance with the Act’s requirements, Stanford notified NIH&para;<br>that it was electing to retain title to the invention and conferred on&para;<br>the Government a license to use the patented procedure.&para;<br>Petitioner, the Board of Trustees of Stanford University, filed suit&para;<br>against respondents (Roche), claiming that their HIV test kits in&para;<br>fringed Stanford’s patents. Roche responded that Holodniy’s agree&para;<br>ment with Cetus gave it co-ownership of the procedure, and thus&para;<br>Stanford lacked standing to sue it for patent infringement. Stanford&para;<br>countered that Holodniy had no rights to assign because the Univer&para;<br>sity had superior rights under the Bayh-Dole Act. The District Court&para;<br>agreed with Stanford and held that under the Bayh-Dole Act, Holod&para;<br>niy had no rights to assign to Cetus. The Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Federal Circuit disagreed, concluding that Holodniy’s agreement with&para;<br>Cetus assigned his rights to Cetus, and thus to Roche. It also found&para;<br>that the Bayh-Dole Act did not automatically void an inventor’s&para;<br>rights in federally funded inventions. Thus, the Act did not extin&para;<br>guish Roche’s ownership interest in the invention, and Stanford was&para;<br>deprived of standing.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The Bayh-Dole Act does not automatically vest title to federally&para;<br>funded inventions in federal contractors or authorize contractors to&para;<br>unilaterally take title to such inventions. Pp. 6–15.&para;<br>(a) Since 1790, patent law has operated on the premise that rights&para;<br>in an invention belong to the inventor. See, e.g., Gayler v. Wilder, 10&para;<br>How. 477, 493. In most cases, a patent may be issued only to an ap&para;<br>plying inventor, or—because an inventor’s interest in his invention is&para;<br>assignable in law by an instrument in writing—an inventor’s as&para;<br>signee. See United States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U. S. 178,&para;<br>187. Absent an agreement to the contrary, an employer does not&para;<br>have rights in an invention “which is the original conception of the&para;<br>employee alone,” id., at 189; an inventor must expressly grant those&para;<br>rights to his employer, see id., at 187. Pp. 6–8.&para;<br>(b) Stanford and amicus United States contend that, when an in&para;<br>vention is conceived or first reduced to practice with the support of&para;<br>federal funds, the Bayh-Dole Act vests title to those inventions in the&para;<br>inventor’s employer—the federal contractor. Congress has in the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>past divested inventors of their rights in inventions by providing un&para;<br>ambiguously that inventions created pursuant to certain specified&para;<br>federal contracts become the Government’s property. Such unambi&para;<br>guous language is notably absent from the Bayh-Dole Act. Instead,&para;<br>the Act provides that contractors may “elect to retain title to any sub&para;<br>ject invention,” §202(a), defining a “subject invention” as “any inven&para;<br>tion of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in&para;<br>the performance of work under a funding agreement,” §201(e).&para;<br>Stanford contends that “invention of the contractor” means all in&para;<br>ventions that a contractor’s employees make with the aid of federal&para;<br>funds. That reading assumes that Congress subtly set aside two cen&para;<br>turies of patent law in a statutory definition. This Court has rejected&para;<br>the idea that mere employment is sufficient to vest title to an em&para;<br>ployee’s invention in the employer. Stanford’s reading also renders&para;<br>the phrase “of the contractor” superfluous since the definition already&para;<br>covers inventions made under a funding agreement. Construing the&para;<br>phrase to refer instead to a particular category of inventions con&para;<br>ceived or reduced to practice under a funding agreement—inventions&para;<br>“of the contractor,” that is, those owned by or belonging to the con&para;<br>tractor—makes the phrase meaningful in the statutory definition.&para;<br>And “invention owned by the contractor” or “invention belonging to&para;<br>the contractor” are natural readings of the phrase “invention of the&para;<br>contractor.”&para;<br>Section 202(a), which states that contractors may “elect to retain&para;<br>title,” confirms that the Act does not vest title. Stanford reaches the&para;<br>opposite conclusion, but only because it reads “retain” to mean “ac&para;<br>quire” and “receive.” That is certainly not the common meaning of&para;<br>“retain,” which is “to hold or continue to hold in possession or use.”&para;<br>You cannot retain something unless you already have it. And&para;<br>§210(a)—which provides that the Act “take[s] precedence over any&para;<br>other Act which would require a disposition of rights in subject inven&para;<br>tions . . . that is inconsistent with” the Act—does not displace the ba&para;<br>sic principle that an inventor owns the rights to his invention. Only&para;<br>when an invention belongs to the contractor does the Bayh-Dole Act&para;<br>come into play. The Act’s disposition of rights does nothing more&para;<br>than clarify the order of priority of rights between the Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment and a federal contractor in a federally funded invention that&para;<br>already belongs to the contractor.&para;<br>The Act’s isolated provisions dealing with inventors’ rights in sub&para;<br>ject inventions are consistent with the Court’s construction of the Act.&para;<br>See §202(d). That construction is also bolstered by the Act’s limited&para;<br>procedural protections, which expressly give contractors the right to&para;<br>challenge a Government-imposed impediment to retaining title to a&para;<br>subject invention, §202(b)(4), but do not provide similar protection for&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR &para;<br>&para;<br>UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. &para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>inventor and third-party rights.&para;<br>Stanford’s contrary construction would permit title to an em&para;<br>ployee’s inventions to vest in the University even if the invention was&para;<br>conceived before the inventor became an employee, so long as the in&para;<br>vention’s reduction to practice was supported by federal funding. It&para;<br>also suggests that the school would obtain title were even one dollar&para;<br>of federal funding applied toward an invention’s conception or reduc&para;<br>tion to practice. It would be noteworthy enough for Congress to sup&para;<br>plant one of the fundamental precepts of patent law and deprive in&para;<br>ventors of rights in their own inventions. To do so under such&para;<br>unusual terms would be truly surprising. Had Congress intended&para;<br>such a sea change in intellectual property rights it would have said so&para;<br>clearly—not obliquely through an ambiguous definition of “subject&para;<br>invention” and an idiosyncratic use of the word “retain.”&para;<br>The Court’s construction of the Act is also reflected in the common&para;<br>practice of contractors, who generally obtain assignments from their&para;<br>employees, and of agencies that fund federal contractors, who typi&para;<br>cally expect those contractors to obtain assignments. With effective&para;<br>assignments, federally funded inventions become “subject inventions”&para;<br>and the Act as a practical matter works pretty much the way Stan&para;<br>ford says it should. The only significant difference is that it does so&para;<br>without violence to the basic patent law principle that inventors own&para;<br>their inventions.

The&para;<br>question here is whether the University and Small Busi&para;<br>ness Patent Procedures Act of 1980—commonly referred to&para;<br>as the Bayh-Dole Act—displaces that norm and automati&para;<br>cally vests title to federally funded inventions in federal&para;<br>contractors. We hold that it does not.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>In 1985, a small California research company called&para;<br>Cetus began to develop methods for quantifying blood&para;<br>borne levels of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the&para;<br>virus that causes AIDS.

PCR allows billions&para;<br>of copies of DNA sequences to be made from a small initial&para;<br>blood sample.&para;<br>In 1988, Cetus began to collaborate with scientists at&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR &para;<br>&para;<br>UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Stanford University’s Department of Infectious Diseases&para;<br>to test the efficacy of new AIDS drugs. Dr. Mark Holodniy&para;<br>joined Stanford as a research fellow in the department&para;<br>around that time. When he did so, he signed a Copyright&para;<br>and Patent Agreement (CPA) stating that he “agree[d] to&para;<br>assign” to Stanford his “right, title and interest in” inven&para;<br>tions resulting from his employment at the University.&para;<br>App. to Pet. for Cert. 118a–119a.&para;<br>At Stanford Holodniy undertook to develop an improved&para;<br>method for quantifying HIV levels in patient blood sam&para;<br>ples, using PCR. Because Holodniy was largely unfamiliar&para;<br>with PCR, his supervisor arranged for him to conduct&para;<br>research at Cetus. As a condition of gaining access to&para;<br>Cetus, Holodniy signed a Visitor’s Confidentiality Agree&para;<br>ment (VCA). That agreement stated that Holodniy “will&para;<br>assign and do[es] hereby assign” to Cetus his “right, title&para;<br>and interest in each of the ideas, inventions and improve&para;<br>ments” made “as a consequence of [his] access” to Cetus.&para;<br>Id., at 122a–124a.&para;<br>For the next nine months, Holodniy conducted research&para;<br>at Cetus. Working with Cetus employees, Holodniy de&para;<br>vised a PCR-based procedure for calculating the amount of&para;<br>HIV in a patient’s blood. That technique allowed doctors&para;<br>to determine whether a patient was benefiting from HIV&para;<br>therapy.&para;<br>Holodniy then returned to Stanford where he and other&para;<br>University employees tested the HIV measurement tech&para;<br>nique. Over the next few years, Stanford obtained written&para;<br>assignments of rights from the Stanford employees in&para;<br>volved in refinement of the technique, including Holodniy,&para;<br>and filed several patent applications related to the proce&para;<br>dure. Stanford secured three patents to the HIV meas&para;<br>urement process.&para;<br>In 1991, Roche Molecular Systems, a company that&para;<br>specializes in diagnostic blood screening, acquired Cetus’s&para;<br>PCR-related assets, including all rights Cetus had ob&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>tained through agreements like the VCA signed by Holod&para;<br>niy. After conducting clinical trials on the HIV quantifica&para;<br>tion method developed at Cetus, Roche commercialized the&para;<br>procedure. Today, Roche’s HIV test “kits are used in&para;<br>hospitals and AIDS clinics worldwide.” Brief for Respon&para;<br>dents 10–11.&para;<br>B&para;<br>In 1980, Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act to “promote&para;<br>the utilization of inventions arising from federally sup&para;<br>ported research,” “promote collaboration between commer&para;<br>cial concerns and nonprofit organizations,” and “ensure&para;<br>that the Government obtains sufficient rights in federally&para;<br>supported inventions.” 35 U. S. C. §200. To achieve these&para;<br>aims, the Act allocates rights in federally funded “subject&para;<br>invention[s]” between the Federal Government and federal&para;<br>contractors (“any person, small business firm, or nonprofit&para;<br>organization that is a party to a funding agreement”).&para;<br>§§201(e), (c), 202(a). The Act defines “subject invention”&para;<br>as “any invention of the contractor conceived or first actu&para;<br>ally reduced to practice in the performance of work under&para;<br>a funding agreement.” §201(e).&para;<br>The Bayh-Dole Act provides that contractors may “elect&para;<br>to retain title to any subject invention.” §202(a). To be&para;<br>able to retain title, a contractor must fulfill a number of&para;<br>obligations imposed by the statute. The contractor must&para;<br>“disclose each subject invention to the [relevant] Federal&para;<br>agency within a reasonable time”; it must “make a written&para;<br>election within two years after disclosure” stating that&para;<br>the contractor opts to retain title to the invention; and the&para;<br>contractor must “file a patent application prior to any&para;<br>statutory bar date.” §§202(c)(1)–(3). The “Federal Gov&para;<br>ernment may receive title” to a subject invention if a&para;<br>contractor fails to comply with any of these obligations.&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>The Government has several rights in federally funded&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR &para;<br>&para;<br>UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>subject inventions under the Bayh-Dole Act. The agency&para;<br>that granted the federal funds receives from the contractor&para;<br>“a nonexclusive, nontransferrable, irrevocable, paid-up&para;<br>license to practice . . . [the] subject invention.” §202(c)(4).&para;<br>The agency also possesses “[m]arch-in rights,” which&para;<br>permit the agency to grant a license to a responsible third&para;<br>party under certain circumstances, such as when the con&para;<br>tractor fails to take “effective steps to achieve practical&para;<br>application” of the invention. §203. The Act further pro&para;<br>vides that when the contractor does not elect to retain title&para;<br>to a subject invention, the Government “may consider and&para;<br>after consultation with the contractor grant requests for&para;<br>retention of rights by the inventor.” §202(d).&para;<br>Some of Stanford’s research related to the HIV meas&para;<br>urement technique was funded by the National Institutes&para;<br>of Health (NIH), thereby subjecting the invention to the&para;<br>Bayh-Dole Act. Accordingly, Stanford disclosed the in&para;<br>vention, conferred on the Government a nonexclusive,&para;<br>nontransferable, paid-up license to use the patented proce&para;<br>dure, and formally notified NIH that it elected to retain&para;<br>title to the invention.&para;<br>C&para;<br>In 2005, the Board of Trustees of Stanford University&para;<br>filed suit against Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Roche&para;<br>Diagnostics Corporation, and Roche Diagnostics Opera&para;<br>tions, Inc. (collectively Roche), contending that Roche’s&para;<br>HIV test kits infringed Stanford’s patents. As relevant&para;<br>here, Roche responded by asserting that it was a co-owner&para;<br>of the HIV quantification procedure, based on Holodniy’s&para;<br>assignment of his rights in the Visitor’s Confidentiality&para;<br>Agreement. As a result, Roche argued, Stanford lacked&para;<br>standing to sue it for patent infringement. 487 F. Supp.&para;<br>2d 1099, 1111, 1115 (ND Cal. 2007). Stanford claimed&para;<br>that Holodniy had no rights to assign because the Univer&para;<br>sity’s HIV research was federally funded, giving the school&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>superior rights in the invention under the Bayh-Dole Act.&para;<br>Ibid.1&para;<br>The District Court held that the “VCA effectively as&para;<br>signed any rights that Holodniy had in the patented in&para;<br>vention to Cetus,” and thus to Roche. Id., at 1117. But&para;<br>because of the operation of the Bayh-Dole Act, “Holodniy&para;<br>had no interest to assign.” Id., at 1117, 1119. The court&para;<br>concluded that the Bayh-Dole Act “provides that the indi&para;<br>vidual inventor may obtain title” to a federally funded&para;<br>invention “only after the government and the contracting&para;<br>party have declined to do so.” Id., at 1118.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit disagreed.&para;<br>First, the court concluded that Holodniy’s initial agree&para;<br>ment with Stanford in the Copyright and Patent Agree&para;<br>ment constituted a mere promise to assign rights in the&para;<br>future, unlike Holodniy’s agreement with Cetus in the&para;<br>Visitor’s Confidentiality Agreement, which itself assigned&para;<br>Holodniy’s rights in the invention to Cetus. See 583 F. 3d&para;<br>832, 841–842 (2009). Therefore, as a matter of contract&para;<br>law, Cetus obtained Holodniy’s rights in the HIV quantifi&para;<br>cation technique through the VCA.2 Next, the court ex&para;<br>plained that the Bayh-Dole Act “does not automatically&para;<br>void ab initio the inventors’ rights in government-funded&para;<br>inventions” and that the “statutory scheme did not auto&para;<br>matically void the patent rights that Cetus received from&para;<br>Holodniy.” Id., at 844–845. The court held that “Roche&para;<br>possesse[d] an ownership interest in the patents-in-suit”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Roche submitted a host of other claims to the District Court, includ&para;<br>ing that it had “shop rights” to the patents and was entitled to a license&para;<br>to use the patents. See 583 F. 3d 832, 838 (CA Fed. 2009). None of&para;<br>those claims is now before us; we deal only with Roche’s claim to co&para;<br>ownership to rebut Stanford’s standing to bring an infringement action.&para;<br>2 Because the Federal Circuit’s interpretation of the relevant assign&para;<br>ment agreements is not an issue on which we granted certiorari, we&para;<br>have no occasion to pass on the validity of the lower court’s construction&para;<br>of those agreements.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR &para;<br>&para;<br>UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. &para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>that was not extinguished by the Bayh-Dole Act, “de&para;<br>priv[ing] Stanford of standing.” Id., at 836–837. The&para;<br>Court of Appeals then remanded the case with instruc&para;<br>tions to dismiss Stanford’s infringement claim. Id., at 849.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 562 U. S. ___ (2010).&para;<br>II &para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress has the authority “[t]o promote the Progress of&para;<br>Science and useful Arts, by securing . . . to Authors and&para;<br>Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings&para;<br>and Discoveries.” U. S. Const. Art. I, §8, cl. 8. The first&para;<br>Congress put that power to use by enacting the Patent Act&para;<br>of 1790. That Act provided “[t]hat upon the petition of any&para;<br>person or persons . . . setting forth, that he, she, or they,&para;<br>hath or have invented or discovered” an invention, a pat&para;<br>ent could be granted to “such petitioner or petitioners” or&para;<br>“their heirs, administrators or assigns.” Act of Apr. 10,&para;<br>1790, §1, 1 Stat. 109–110. Under that law, the first patent&para;<br>was granted in 1790 to Samuel Hopkins, who had devised&para;<br>an improved method for making potash, America’s first&para;<br>industrial chemical. U. S. Patent No. 1 (issued July 31,&para;<br>1790).3&para;<br>Although much in intellectual property law has changed&para;<br>in the 220 years since the first Patent Act, the basic idea&para;<br>that inventors have the right to patent their inventions&para;<br>has not. Under the law in its current form, “[w]hoever&para;<br>invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine,&para;<br>manufacture, or composition of matter . . . may obtain a&para;<br>patent therefor.” 35 U. S. C. §101. The inventor must&para;<br>attest that “he believes himself to be the original and first&para;<br>inventor of the [invention] for which he solicits a patent.”&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 The&para;<br>&para;<br>patent was signed by President George Washington, Secretary&para;<br>of State Thomas Jefferson, and Attorney General Edmund Randolph.&para;<br>See Maxey, Samuel Hopkins, The Holder of the First U.

S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§115. In most cases, a patent may be issued only to an&para;<br>applying inventor, or—because an inventor’s interest in&para;<br>his invention is “assignable in law by an instrument in&para;<br>writing”—an inventor’s assignee. §§151, 152, 261.&para;<br>Our precedents confirm the general rule that rights in&para;<br>an invention belong to the inventor. See, e.g., Gayler v.&para;<br>Wilder, 10 How. 477, 493 (1851) (“the discoverer of a new&para;<br>and useful improvement is vested by law with an inchoate&para;<br>right to its exclusive use, which he may perfect and make&para;<br>absolute by proceeding in the manner which the law re&para;<br>quires”); Solomons v. United States, 137 U. S. 342, 346&para;<br>(1890) (“whatever invention [an inventor] may thus con&para;<br>ceive and perfect is his individual property”); United&para;<br>States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U. S. 178, 188&para;<br>(1933) (an inventor owns “the product of [his] original&para;<br>thought”). The treatises are to the same effect. See, e.g., 8&para;<br>Chisum on Patents §22.01, p. 22–2 (2011) (“The presump&para;<br>tive owner of the property right in a patentable invention&para;<br>is the single human inventor”).&para;<br>It is equally well established that an inventor can assign&para;<br>his rights in an invention to a third party.

In their view, the Act moves inventors from the&para;<br>front of the line to the back by vesting title to federally&para;<br>funded inventions in the inventor’s employer—the federal&para;<br>contractor. See Brief for Petitioner 26–27; Brief for United&para;<br>States as Amicus Curiae 6.&para;<br>Congress has in the past divested inventors of their&para;<br>rights in inventions by providing unambiguously that&para;<br>inventions created pursuant to specified federal contracts&para;<br>become the property of the United States.

That reading assumes that Congress subtly set&para;<br>aside two centuries of patent law in a statutory definition.&para;<br>It also renders the phrase “of the contractor” superfluous.&para;<br>If the phrase “of the contractor” were deleted from the&para;<br>definition of “subject invention,” the definition would cover&para;<br>“any invention . . . conceived or first actually reduced to&para;<br>practice in the performance of work under a funding&para;<br>agreement.” Reading “of the contractor” to mean “all&para;<br>inventions made by the contractor’s employees with the&para;<br>aid of federal funding,” as Stanford would, adds nothing&para;<br>that is not already in the definition, since the definition&para;<br>already covers inventions made under the funding agree&para;<br>ment.

That is&para;<br>certainly not the common meaning of “retain.” “[R]etain”&para;<br>means “to hold or continue to hold in possession or use.”&para;<br>Webster’s Third, supra, at 1938; see Webster’s New Colle&para;<br>giate Dictionary 980 (1980) (“to keep in possession or&para;<br>use”); American Heritage Dictionary 1109 (1969) (“[t]o&para;<br>keep or hold in one’s possession”).

The Bayh-Dole Act does not confer title to feder&para;<br>ally funded inventions on contractors or authorize contrac&para;<br>tors to unilaterally take title to those inventions; it simply&para;<br>assures contractors that they may keep title to whatever it&para;<br>is they already have. Such a provision makes sense in a&para;<br>statute specifying the respective rights and responsibili&para;<br>ties of federal contractors and the Government.&para;<br>The Bayh-Dole Act states that it “take[s] precedence&para;<br>over any other Act which would require a disposition of&para;<br>rights in subject inventions . . . that is inconsistent with”&para;<br>the Act. 35 U.

ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>§210(a), applies only to “subject inventions”—“inventions&para;<br>of the contractor”—it does not displace an inventor’s ante&para;<br>cedent title to his invention. Only when an invention&para;<br>belongs to the contractor does the Bayh-Dole Act come into&para;<br>play. The Act’s disposition of rights—like much of the&para;<br>rest of the Bayh-Dole Act—serves to clarify the order of&para;<br>priority of rights between the Federal Government and a&para;<br>federal contractor in a federally funded invention that&para;<br>already belongs to the contractor. Nothing more.5&para;<br>The isolated provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act dealing&para;<br>with inventors’ rights in subject inventions are consistent&para;<br>with our construction of the Act. Under the Act, a federal&para;<br>agency may “grant requests for retention of rights by the&para;<br>inventor . . . [i]f a contractor does not elect to retain title to&para;<br>a subject invention.” §202(d). If an employee inventor&para;<br>never had title to his invention because title vested in the&para;<br>contractor by operation of law—as Stanford submits—it&para;<br>would be odd to allow the Government to grant “requests&para;<br>for retention of rights by the inventor.” By using the word&para;<br>“retention,” §202(d) assumes that the inventor had rights&para;<br>in the subject invention at some point, undermining the&para;<br>notion that the Act automatically vests title to federally&para;<br>funded inventions in federal contractors.6&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Far&para;<br>&para;<br>from superseding the Patent Act in such a backhanded way, it is&para;<br>clear that §210(a)’s concern is far narrower. That provision specifies 21&para;<br>different statutory provisions that the Bayh-Dole Act “take[s] prece&para;<br>dence over,” the vast majority of which deal with the division of owner&para;<br>ship in certain inventions between a contractor and the Government.&para;<br>35 U. S. C. §§210(a)(1)–(21); see, e.g., §§210(a)(19)–(20) (the Bayh-Dole&para;<br>Act takes precedence over “section 6(b) of the Solar Photovoltaic Energy&para;<br>Research Development and Demonstration Act” and “section 12 of the&para;<br>Native Latex Commercialization and Economic Development Act”).&para;<br>6 Stanford contends that it cannot be the case “that the contractor can&para;<br>only ‘retain title’ to an invention that it already owns, while an inventor&para;<br>may be considered for ‘retention’ of title only when he has assigned title&para;<br>away.” Reply Brief for Petitioner 8. That argument has some force.&para;<br>But there may be situations where an inventor, by the terms of an&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>The limited scope of the Act’s procedural protections&para;<br>also bolsters our conclusion. The Bayh-Dole Act expressly&para;<br>confers on contractors the right to challenge a Govern&para;<br>ment-imposed impediment to retaining title to a subject&para;<br>invention. §202(b)(4). As Roche correctly notes, however,&para;<br>“the Act contains not a single procedural protection for&para;<br>third parties that have neither sought nor received federal&para;<br>funds,” such as cooperating private research institutions.&para;<br>Brief for Respondents 29. Nor does the Bayh-Dole Act&para;<br>allow inventors employed by federal contractors to contest&para;<br>their employer’s claim to a subject invention. The Act, for&para;<br>example, does not expressly permit an interested third&para;<br>party or an inventor to challenge a claim that a particular&para;<br>invention was supported by federal funding. In a world in&para;<br>which there is frequent collaboration between private&para;<br>entities, inventors, and federal contractors, see Brief for&para;<br>Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America&para;<br>as Amicus Curiae 22–23, that absence would be deeply&para;<br>troubling. But the lack of procedures protecting inventor&para;<br>and third-party rights makes perfect sense if the Act&para;<br>applies only when a federal contractor has already ac&para;<br>quired title to an inventor’s interest. In that case, there is&para;<br>no need to protect inventor or third-party rights, because&para;<br>the only rights at issue are those of the contractor and the&para;<br>Government.&para;<br>The Bayh-Dole Act applies to subject inventions “con&para;<br>ceived or first actually reduced to practice in the perform&para;<br>ance of work” “funded in whole or in part by the Federal&para;<br>Government.” 35 U.

Under Stanford’s construction of the Act, title to&para;<br>—————— &para;<br>&para;<br>assignment, has subsidiary rights in an invention to which a contractor&para;<br>&para;<br>has title, as §202(d) suggests. Compare §202(d) (“retention of rights”)&para;<br>&para;<br>with §202(a) (“retain title”) (emphasis added). And at the end of the &para;<br>&para;<br>day, it is Stanford’s contention that “retain” must be “read as a syno&para;<br>&para;<br>nym for ‘acquire’ or ‘receive’ ” that dooms its argument on this point.&para;<br>&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 37. &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR&para;<br>UNIV. v.

They also include statutes,&para;<br>which, in specific research areas, give the Government&para;<br>title to inventions made pursuant to Government con&para;<br>tracts. See Atomic Energy Act of 1954, §152, 68 Stat. 944&para;<br>(codified as amended at 42 U. S. C. §2182); National Aero&para;<br>nautics and Space Act of 1958, §305, 72 Stat. 435 (codified&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR &para;<br>&para;<br>UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>at 42 U. S.

And they have included Government&para;<br>regulations, established prior to the Bayh-Dole Act’s en&para;<br>actment, that work in roughly similar ways. See, e.g., 45&para;<br>CFR §650.4(b) (1977) (National Science Foundation regu&para;<br>lations providing that Foundation would “determine the&para;<br>disposition of the invention [made under the grant] and&para;<br>title to and rights under any patent application”); §§8.1(a),&para;<br>8.2(d) (Department of Health, Education, and Welfare&para;<br>regulations providing that inventions made under de&para;<br>partment grants “shall be subject to determination” by the&para;<br>agency and that the department may “require that all&para;<br>domestic rights in the invention shall be assigned to the&para;<br>United States”).&para;<br>These legal rules provide the basic background against&para;<br>which Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act. And the Act’s&para;<br>provisions reflect a related effort to assure that rights to&para;<br>inventions arising out of research for which the public has&para;<br>paid are distributed and used in ways that further specific&para;<br>important public interests. I agree with the majority that&para;<br>the Act does not simply take the individual inventors’&para;<br>rights and grant them to the Government. Rather, it&para;<br>assumes that the federal funds’ recipient, say a university&para;<br>or small business, will possess those rights. The Act&para;<br>leaves those rights in the hands of that recipient, not&para;<br>because it seeks to make the public pay twice for the same&para;<br>invention, but for a special public policy reason. In doing&para;<br>so, it seeks to encourage those institutions to commercial&para;<br>ize inventions that otherwise might not realize their po&para;<br>tentially beneficial public use. 35 U. S. C. §200. The Act&para;<br>helps assure that commercialization (while “promot[ing]&para;<br>free competition” and “protect[ing] the public,” ibid.) by&para;<br>imposing a set of conditions upon the federal funds recipi&para;<br>ent, by providing that sometimes the Government will&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>take direct control of the patent rights, and by adding that&para;<br>on occasion the Government will permit the individual&para;<br>inventor to retain those rights. §§202–203.&para;<br>Given this basic statutory objective, I cannot so easily&para;<br>accept the majority’s conclusion—that the individual in&para;<br>ventor can lawfully assign an invention (produced by&para;<br>public funds) to a third party, thereby taking that inven&para;<br>tion out from under the Bayh-Dole Act’s restrictions,&para;<br>conditions, and allocation rules. That conclusion, in my&para;<br>view, is inconsistent with the Act’s basic purposes. It may&para;<br>significantly undercut the Act’s ability to achieve its objec&para;<br>tives. It allows individual inventors, for whose invention&para;<br>the public has paid, to avoid the Act’s corresponding re&para;<br>strictions and conditions. And it makes the commerciali&para;<br>zation and marketing of such an invention more difficult:&para;<br>A potential purchaser of rights from the contractor, say a&para;<br>university, will not know if the university itself possesses&para;<br>the patent right in question or whether, as here, the indi&para;<br>vidual, inadvertently or deliberately, has previously as&para;<br>signed the title to a third party.&para;<br>Moreover, I do not agree that the language to which the&para;<br>majority points—the words “invention of the contractor”&para;<br>and “retain”—requires its result. As the majority con&para;<br>cedes, Stanford’s alternative reading of the phrase “ ‘in&para;<br>vention of the contractor’ ” is “plausible enough in the&para;<br>abstract.” Ante, at 10. Nor do I agree that the Act’s lack&para;<br>of an explicit provision for “an interested third party” to&para;<br>claim that an invention was not the result of federal fund&para;<br>ing “bolsters” the majority’s interpretation. Ante, at 13.&para;<br>In any event, universities and businesses have worked out&para;<br>ways to protect the various participants to research. See&para;<br>Brief for Association of American Universities et al. as&para;<br>Amici Curiae 22–24 (hereinafter AAU Brief); App. 118–&para;<br>124 (Materials Transfer Agreement between Cetus and&para;<br>Stanford University).&para;<br>Ultimately, the majority rejects Stanford’s reading (and&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR &para;<br>&para;<br>UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>the Government’s reading) of the Act because it believes&para;<br>that it is inconsistent with certain background norms of&para;<br>patent law, norms that ordinarily provide an individual&para;<br>inventor with full patent rights. Ante, at 10. But in my&para;<br>view, the competing norms governing rights in inventions&para;<br>for which the public has already paid, along with the&para;<br>Bayh-Dole Act’s objectives, suggest a different result.&para;<br>III&para;<br>There are two different legal routes to what I consider&para;<br>an interpretation more consistent with the statute’s objec&para;<br>tives. First, we could set aside the Federal Circuit’s inter&para;<br>pretation of the licensing agreements and its related&para;<br>licensing doctrine. That doctrine governs interpretation of&para;<br>licensing agreements made before an invention is con&para;<br>ceived or reduced to practice. Here, there are two such&para;<br>agreements. In the earlier agreement—that between Dr.&para;<br>Holodniy and Stanford University—Dr. Holodniy said, “I&para;<br>agree to assign . . . to Stanford . . . that right, title and&para;<br>interest in and to . . . such inventions as required by Con&para;<br>tracts and Grants.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 119a (emphasis&para;<br>added). In the later agreement—that between Dr. Holod&para;<br>niy and the private research firm Cetus—Dr. Holodniy&para;<br>said, “I will assign and do hereby assign to Cetus, my&para;<br>right, title, and interest in” here relevant “ideas” and&para;<br>“inventions.” Id., at 123a (emphasis added; capitalization&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>The Federal Circuit held that the earlier Stanford agree&para;<br>ment’s use of the words “agree to assign,” when compared&para;<br>with the later Cetus agreement’s use of the words “do&para;<br>hereby assign,” made all the difference. It concluded that,&para;<br>once the invention came into existence, the latter words&para;<br>meant that the Cetus agreement trumped the earlier,&para;<br>Stanford agreement. 583 F. 3d 832, 841–842 (CA Fed.&para;<br>2009). That, in the Circuit’s view, is because the latter&para;<br>words operated upon the invention automatically, while&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the former did not. Quoting its 1991 opinion in FilmTec&para;<br>Corp. v. Allied-Signal, Inc., 939 F. 2d 1568, 1572, the&para;<br>Circuit declared that “ ‘[o]nce the invention is made and&para;<br>[the] application for [a] patent is filed, . . . legal title to the&para;<br>rights accruing thereunder would be in the assignee [i.e.,&para;<br>Cetus] . . . , and the assignor-inventor would have nothing&para;<br>remaining to assign.’ ” 583 F. 3d, at 842.&para;<br>Given what seem only slight linguistic differences in the&para;<br>contractual language, this reasoning seems to make too&para;<br>much of too little. Dr. Holodniy executed his agreement&para;<br>with Stanford in 1988. At that time, patent law appears&para;<br>to have long specified that a present assignment of future&para;<br>inventions (as in both contracts here) conveyed equitable,&para;<br>but not legal, title. See, e.g., G. Curtis, A Treatise on the&para;<br>Law of Patents for Useful Inventions §170, p. 155 (3d ed.&para;<br>1867) (“A contract to convey a future invention . . . cannot&para;<br>alone authorize a patent to be taken by the party in whose&para;<br>favor such a contract was intended to operate”); Comment,&para;<br>Contract Rights as Commercial Security: Present and&para;<br>Future Intangibles, 67 Yale L. J. 847, 854, n. 27 (1958)&para;<br>(“The rule generally applicable grants equitable enforce&para;<br>ment to an assignment of an expectancy but demands a&para;<br>further act, either reduction to possession or further as&para;<br>signment of the right when it comes into existence”).&para;<br>Under this rule, both the initial Stanford and later&para;<br>Cetus agreements would have given rise only to equitable&para;<br>interests in Dr. Holodniy’s invention. And as between&para;<br>these two claims in equity, the facts that Stanford’s con&para;<br>tract came first and that Stanford subsequently obtained a&para;<br>postinvention assignment as well should have meant that&para;<br>Stanford, not Cetus, would receive the rights its contract&para;<br>conveyed.&para;<br>In 1991, however, the Federal Circuit, in FilmTec,&para;<br>adopted the new rule quoted above—a rule that distin&para;<br>guishes between these equitable claims and, in effect, says&para;<br>that Cetus must win. The Federal Circuit provided no&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR &para;<br>&para;<br>UNIV. v. ROCHE MOLECULAR SYSTEMS, INC. &para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>explanation for what seems a significant change in the&para;<br>law. See 939 F. 2d, at 1572. Nor did it give any explana&para;<br>tion for that change in its opinion in this case. See 583&para;<br>F. 3d, at 841–842. The Federal Circuit’s FilmTec rule&para;<br>undercuts the objectives of the Bayh-Dole Act. While the&para;<br>cognoscenti may be able to meet the FilmTec rule in future&para;<br>contracts simply by copying the precise words blessed by&para;<br>the Federal Circuit, the rule nonetheless remains a tech&para;<br>nical drafting trap for the unwary. See AAU Brief 35–36.&para;<br>But cf. ante, at 15 (assuming ease of obtaining effective&para;<br>assignments). It is unclear to me why, where the BayhDole Act is at issue, we should prefer the Federal Circuit’s&para;<br>FilmTec rule to the rule, of apparently much longer vin&para;<br>tage, that would treat both agreements in this case as&para;<br>creating merely equitable rights.&para;<br>At the same time, the Federal Circuit’s reasoning brings&para;<br>about an interpretation contrary to the intention of the&para;<br>parties to the earlier, Stanford, contract. See App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 120a (provision in Stanford contract promising&para;<br>that Dr. Holodniy “will not enter into any agreement&para;<br>creating copyright or patent obligations in conflict with&para;<br>this agreement”). And it runs counter to what may well&para;<br>have been the drafters’ reasonable expectations of how&para;<br>courts would interpret the relevant language.&para;<br>Second, we could interpret the Bayh-Dole Act as ordi&para;<br>narily assuming, and thereby ordinarily requiring, an&para;<br>assignment of patent rights by the federally funded em&para;<br>ployee to the federally funded employer. I concede that&para;<br>this interpretation would treat federally funded employees&para;<br>of contractors (subject to the Act) differently than the law&para;<br>ordinarily treats private sector employees. The Court long&para;<br>ago described the latter, private sector principles. In&para;<br>United States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U. S. 178&para;<br>(1933), the Court explained that a “patent is property, and&para;<br>title to it can pass only by assignment.” Id., at 187. It&para;<br>then described two categories of private sector employee&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>to-employer assignments as follows: First, a person who is&para;<br>“employed to make an invention, who succeeds, dur&para;<br>ing his term of service, in accomplishing that task, is&para;<br>bound to assign to his employer any patent obtained.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>But, second,&para;<br>“if the employment be general, albeit it cover a field of&para;<br>labor and effort in the performance of which the em&para;<br>ployee conceived the invention for which he obtained a&para;<br>patent, the contract is not so broadly construed as to&para;<br>require an assignment of the patent.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Court added that, because of “the peculiar nature of&para;<br>the act of invention,” courts are “reluctan[t] . . . to imply or&para;<br>infer an agreement by the employee to assign his patent.”&para;<br>Id., at 188. And it applied these same principles govern&para;<br>ing assignment to inventions made by employees of the&para;<br>United States. Id., at 189–190.&para;<br>Subsequently, however, the President promulgated&para;<br>Executive Order 10096. Courts have since found that this&para;<br>Executive Order, not Dubilier, governs Federal Govern&para;<br>ment employee-to-employer patent right assignments.&para;<br>See, e.g., Kaplan v. Corcoran, 545 F. 2d 1073, 1076–1077&para;<br>(CA7 1976); Heinemann, 796 F. 2d, at 455–456; Wright v.&para;<br>United States, 164 F. 3d 267, 269 (CA5 1999); Halas v.&para;<br>United States, 28 Fed. Cl. 354, 364 (1993). The Bayh-Dole&para;<br>Act seeks objectives roughly analogous to the objectives of&para;<br>the Executive Order. At least one agency has promulgated&para;<br>regulations that require Bayh-Dole contractors to insist&para;<br>upon similar assignments. See NIH Policies, Procedures,&para;<br>and Forms, A “20–20” View of Invention Reporting to the&para;<br>National Institutes of Health (Sept. 22, 1995) (available in&para;<br>the Clerk of Court’s case file) (requiring a Government&para;<br>contractor, such as Stanford University, to “have in place&para;<br>employee agreements requiring an inventor to ‘assign’ or&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR&para;<br>UNIV. v.

And an amicus brief, filed by major associa&para;<br>tions of universities, scientists, medical researchers, and&para;<br>others, argues that we should interpret the rules govern&para;<br>ing assignments of the employees at issue here (and&para;<br>consequently the Act’s reference to “inventions of the con&para;<br>tractor”) in a similar way. AAU Brief 5–14.&para;<br>The District Court in this case adopted roughly this&para;<br>approach. 487 F. Supp. 2d 1099, 1118 (ND Cal. 2007)&para;<br>(“[A]lthough title still vests in the named inventor, the&para;<br>inventor remains under a legal obligation to assign his&para;<br>interest either to the government or the nonprofit contrac&para;<br>tor unless the inventor acts within the statutory frame&para;<br>work to retain title”). And since a university often enters&para;<br>into a grant agreement with the Government for a re&para;<br>searcher’s benefit and at his request, see J. Hall, Grant&para;<br>Management 205 (2010), implying such a presumption in&para;<br>favor of compliance with the grant agreement, and thus&para;<br>with the Bayh-Dole Act, would ordinarily be equitable.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>As I have suggested, these views are tentative. That is&para;<br>because the parties have not fully argued these matters&para;<br>(though one amicus brief raises the license interpretation&para;<br>question, see Brief for Alexander M.

Cf. ante, at 5, n. 2. While&para;<br>I do not understand the majority to have foreclosed a&para;<br>similarly situated party from raising these matters in a&para;<br>future case, see ibid., I believe them relevant to our efforts&para;<br>to answer the question presented here.
