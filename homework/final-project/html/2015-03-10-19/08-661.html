NATIONAL FOOTBALL&para;<br>&para;<br>LEAGUE ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–661.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued January 13, 2010—Decided May 24, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>Respondent National Football League (NFL) is an unincorporated asso&para;<br>ciation of 32 separately owned professional football teams, also re&para;<br>spondents here. The teams, each of which owns its own name, colors,&para;<br>logo, trademarks, and related intellectual property, formed respon&para;<br>dent National Football League Properties (NFLP) to develop, license,&para;<br>and market that property. At first, NFLP granted nonexclusive li&para;<br>censes to petitioner and other vendors to manufacture and sell team&para;<br>labeled apparel. In December 2000, however, the teams authorized&para;<br>NFLP to grant exclusive licenses. NFLP granted an exclusive license&para;<br>to respondent Reebok International Ltd. to produce and sell trade&para;<br>marked headwear for all 32 teams. When petitioner’s license was not&para;<br>renewed, it filed this action alleging that the agreements between re&para;<br>spondents violated the Sherman Act, §1 of which makes “[e]very con&para;<br>tract, combination . . . or, conspiracy, in restraint of trade” illegal.&para;<br>Respondents answered that they were incapable of conspiring within&para;<br>§1’s meaning because the NFL and its teams are, in antitrust law&para;<br>jargon, a single entity with respect to the conduct challenged. The&para;<br>District Court granted respondents summary judgment, and the Sev&para;<br>enth Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: The alleged conduct related to licensing of intellectual property&para;<br>constitutes concerted action that is not categorically beyond §1’s cov&para;<br>erage. Pp. 4–20.&para;<br>(a) The meaning of “contract, combination . . . , or, conspiracy” in §1&para;<br>of the Sherman Act is informed by the Act’s “ ‘basic distinction be&para;<br>tween concerted and independent action.’ ” Copperweld Corp. v. In&para;<br>dependence Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752, 767. Section 1 “treat[s] con&para;<br>certed behavior more strictly than unilateral behavior,” id., at 768,&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v. NATIONAL &para;<br>&para;<br>FOOTBALL LEAGUE&para;<br>Syllabus &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>because, unlike independent action, “[c]oncerted activity inherently is&para;<br>fraught with anticompetitive risk” insofar as it “deprives the market&para;<br>place of independent centers of decisionmaking that competition as&para;<br>sumes and demands,” id., at 768–769. And because concerted action&para;<br>is discrete and distinct, a limit on such activity leaves untouched a&para;<br>vast amount of business conduct. That creates less risk of deterring&para;<br>a firm’s necessary conduct and leaves courts to examine only discrete&para;<br>agreements. An arrangement must therefore embody concerted ac&para;<br>tion in order to be a “contract, combination . . . or, conspiracy” under&para;<br>§1. Pp. 4–6.&para;<br>(b) In determining whether there is concerted action under §1, the&para;<br>Court has eschewed formalistic distinctions, such as whether the al&para;<br>leged conspirators are legally distinct entities, in favor of a functional&para;<br>consideration of how they actually operate. The Court has repeatedly&para;<br>found instances in which members of a legally single entity violated&para;<br>§1 when the entity was controlled by a group of competitors and&para;<br>served, in essence, as a vehicle for ongoing concerted activity. See,&para;<br>e.g., United States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U. S. 350, 352–356. Conversely,&para;<br>the Court has found that although the entities may be “separate” for&para;<br>purposes of incorporation or formal title, if they are controlled by a&para;<br>single center of decisionmaking and they control a single aggregation&para;<br>of economic power, an agreement between them does not constitute a&para;<br>“contract, combination . . . or, conspiracy.” Copperweld, 467 U. S., at&para;<br>769. Pp. 6–10.&para;<br>(c) The relevant inquiry is therefore one of substance, not form,&para;<br>which does not turn on whether the alleged parties to contract, com&para;<br>bination, or conspiracy are part of a legally single entity or seem like&para;<br>one firm or multiple firms in any metaphysical sense. The inquiry is&para;<br>whether the agreement in question joins together “separate economic&para;<br>actors pursuing separate economic interests,” Copperweld, 467 U. S.,&para;<br>at 768, such that it “deprives the marketplace of independent centers&para;<br>of decisionmaking,” id., at 769, and therefore of diversity of entrepre&para;<br>neurial interests and thus of actual or potential competition. If it&para;<br>does, then there is concerted action covered by §1, and the court must&para;<br>decide whether the restraint of trade is unreasonable and therefore&para;<br>illegal. Pp. 10–11.&para;<br>(d) The NFL teams do not possess either the unitary decisionmak&para;<br>ing quality or the single aggregation of economic power characteristic&para;<br>of independent action. Each of them is a substantial, independently&para;<br>owned, independently managed business, whose “general corporate&para;<br>actions are guided or determined” by “separate corporate conscious&para;<br>nesses,” and whose “objectives are” not “common.” Copperweld, 467&para;<br>U. S., at 771. They compete with one another, not only on the play&para;<br>ing field, but to attract fans, for gate receipts, and for contracts with&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>managerial and playing personnel. See, e.g., Brown v. Pro Football,&para;<br>Inc., 518 U. S. 231, 249. Directly relevant here, the teams are poten&para;<br>tially competing suppliers in the market for intellectual property.&para;<br>When teams license such property, they are not pursuing the “com&para;<br>mon interests of the whole” league, but, instead, the interests of each&para;<br>“corporation itself.” Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 770. It is not disposi&para;<br>tive, as respondents argue, that, by forming NFLP, they have formed&para;<br>a single entity, akin to a merger, and market their NFL brands&para;<br>through a single outlet. Although the NFL respondents may be simi&para;<br>lar in some sense to a single enterprise, they are not similar in the&para;<br>relevant functional sense. While teams have common interests such&para;<br>as promoting the NFL brand, they are still separate, profit&para;<br>maximizing entities, and their interests in licensing team trade&para;<br>marks are not necessarily aligned. Nor does it matter that the teams&para;<br>may find the alleged cooperation necessary to compete against other&para;<br>forms of entertainment. Although decisions made by NFLP are not&para;<br>as easily classified as concerted activity, the NFLP’s decisions about&para;<br>licensing the teams’ separately owned intellectual property are con&para;<br>certed activity and thus covered by §1 for the same reason that deci&para;<br>sions made directly by the 32 teams are covered by §1. In making the&para;<br>relevant licensing decisions, NFLP is “an instrumentality” of the&para;<br>teams. Sealy, 388 U. S., at 352–354. Pp. 11–17.&para;<br>(e) Football teams that need to cooperate are not trapped by anti&para;<br>trust law. The fact that the NFL teams share an interest in making&para;<br>the entire league successful and profitable, and that they must coop&para;<br>erate to produce games, provides a perfectly sensible justification for&para;<br>making a host of collective decisions. Because some of these re&para;<br>straints on competition are necessary to produce the NFL’s product,&para;<br>the Rule of Reason generally should apply, and teams’ cooperation is&para;<br>likely to be permissible. And depending upon the activity in ques&para;<br>tion, the Rule of Reason can at times be applied without detailed&para;<br>analysis. But the activity at issue in this case is still concerted activ&para;<br>ity covered for §1 purposes.

S. C. §1. The question whether an ar­&para;<br>rangement is a contract, combination, or conspiracy is&para;<br>different from and antecedent to the question whether it&para;<br>unreasonably restrains trade. This case raises that ante­&para;<br>cedent question about the business of the 32 teams in the&para;<br>National Football League (NFL) and a corporate entity&para;<br>that they formed to manage their intellectual property.&para;<br>We conclude that the NFL’s licensing activities constitute&para;<br>concerted action that is not categorically beyond the cov­&para;<br>erage of §1. The legality of that concerted action must be&para;<br>judged under the Rule of Reason.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Originally organized in 1920, the NFL is an unincorpo­&para;<br>rated association that now includes 32 separately owned&para;<br>professional football teams.1 Each team has its own name,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The&para;<br>&para;<br>NFL was founded in Canton, Ohio as the “American Profes­&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v.

In 1963, the&para;<br>teams formed National Football League Properties (NFLP)&para;<br>to develop, license, and market their intellectual property.&para;<br>Most, but not all, of the substantial revenues generated by&para;<br>NFLP have either been given to charity or shared equally&para;<br>among the teams. However, the teams are able to and&para;<br>have at times sought to withdraw from this arrangement.&para;<br>Between 1963 and 2000, NFLP granted nonexclusive&para;<br>licenses to a number of vendors, permitting them to manu­&para;<br>facture and sell apparel bearing team insignias. Peti­&para;<br>tioner, American Needle, Inc., was one of those licensees.&para;<br>In December 2000, the teams voted to authorize NFLP to&para;<br>grant exclusive licenses, and NFLP granted Reebok Inter­&para;<br>national Ltd. an exclusive 10-year license to manufacture&para;<br>and sell trademarked headwear for all 32 teams. It there­&para;<br>after declined to renew American Needle’s nonexclusive&para;<br>license.&para;<br>American Needle filed this action in the Northern Dis­&para;<br>trict of Illinois, alleging that the agreements between the&para;<br>NFL, its teams, NFLP, and Reebok violated §§1 and 2 of&para;<br>the Sherman Act. In their answer to the complaint, the&para;<br>defendants averred that the teams, NFL, and NFLP were&para;<br>incapable of conspiring within the meaning of §1 “because&para;<br>they are a single economic enterprise, at least with respect&para;<br>——————&para;<br>sional Football Association.” United States Football League v.

After limited discov­&para;<br>ery, the District Court granted summary judgment on the&para;<br>question “whether, with regard to the facet of their opera­&para;<br>tions respecting exploitation of intellectual property&para;<br>rights, the NFL and its 32 teams are, in the jargon of&para;<br>antitrust law, acting as a single entity.” American Needle,&para;<br>Inc. v. New Orleans La. Saints, 496 F. Supp. 2d 941, 943&para;<br>(2007). The court concluded “that in that facet of their&para;<br>operations they have so integrated their operations that&para;<br>they should be deemed a single entity rather than joint&para;<br>ventures cooperating for a common purpose.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>The panel observed that “in some contexts, a league seems&para;<br>more aptly described as a single entity immune from&para;<br>antitrust scrutiny, while in others a league appears to be a&para;<br>joint venture between independently owned teams that is&para;<br>subject to review under §1.” 538 F. 3d, 736, 741 (2008).&para;<br>Relying on Circuit precedent, the court limited its inquiry&para;<br>to the particular conduct at issue, licensing of teams’&para;<br>intellectual property. The panel agreed with petitioner&para;<br>that “when making a single-entity determination, courts&para;<br>must examine whether the conduct in question deprives&para;<br>the marketplace of the independent sources of economic&para;<br>control that competition assumes.” Id., at 742. The court,&para;<br>however, discounted the significance of potential competi­&para;<br>tion among the teams regarding the use of their intellec­&para;<br>tual property because the teams “can function only as one&para;<br>source of economic power when collectively producing NFL&para;<br>football.” Id., at 743. The court noted that football itself&para;<br>can only be carried out jointly. See ibid. (“Asserting that&para;<br>a single football team could produce a football game . . . is&para;<br>a Zen riddle: Who wins when a football team plays itself ”).&para;<br>Moreover, “NFL teams share a vital economic interest in&para;<br>collectively promoting NFL football . . . [to] compet[e] with&para;<br>other forms of entertainment.” Ibid. “It thus follows,” the&para;<br>court found, “that only one source of economic power con­&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v. NATIONAL &para;<br>&para;<br>FOOTBALL LEAGUE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>trols the promotion of NFL football,” and “it makes little&para;<br>sense to assert that each individual team has the author­&para;<br>ity, if not the responsibility, to promote the jointly pro­&para;<br>duced NFL football.” Ibid. Recognizing that NFL teams&para;<br>have “license[d] their intellectual property collectively”&para;<br>since 1963, the court held that §1 did not apply. Id., at&para;<br>744.&para;<br>We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. __ (2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>As the case comes to us, we have only a narrow issue to&para;<br>decide: whether the NFL respondents are capable of en­&para;<br>gaging in a “contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy” as&para;<br>defined by §1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. §1, or, as we&para;<br>have sometimes phrased it, whether the alleged activity&para;<br>by the NFL respondents “must be viewed as that of a&para;<br>single enterprise for purposes of §1.” Copperweld Corp. v.&para;<br>Independence Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752, 771 (1984).&para;<br>Taken literally, the applicability of §1 to “every contract,&para;<br>combination . . . or conspiracy” could be understood to&para;<br>cover every conceivable agreement, whether it be a group&para;<br>of competing firms fixing prices or a single firm’s chief&para;<br>executive telling her subordinate how to price their com­&para;<br>pany’s product. But even though, “read literally,” §1&para;<br>would address “the entire body of private contract,” that is&para;<br>not what the statute means. National Soc. of Professional&para;<br>Engineers v. United States, 435 U. S. 679, 688 (1978); see&para;<br>also Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U. S. 1, 5 (2006) (“This&para;<br>Court has not taken a literal approach to this language”);&para;<br>cf. Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246 U. S.&para;<br>231, 238 (1918) (reasoning that the term “restraint of&para;<br>trade” in §1 cannot possibly refer to any restraint on com­&para;<br>petition because “[e]very agreement concerning trade,&para;<br>every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain,&para;<br>is of their very essence”). Not every instance of cooperation between two people is a potential “contract,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>combination . . . , or conspiracy, in restraint of trade.” 15&para;<br>U. S. C. §1.&para;<br>The meaning of the term “contract, combination . . . or&para;<br>conspiracy” is informed by the “ ‘basic distinction’ ” in the&para;<br>Sherman Act “ ‘between concerted and independent ac­&para;<br>tion’ ” that distinguishes §1 of the Sherman Act from §2.&para;<br>Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 767 (quoting Monsanto Co. v.&para;<br>Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U. S. 752, 761 (1984)).&para;<br>Section 1 applies only to concerted action that restrains&para;<br>trade. Section 2, by contrast, covers both concerted and&para;<br>independent action, but only if that action “monopolize[s],”&para;<br>15 U. S. C. §2, or “threatens actual monopolization,” Cop&para;<br>perweld, 467 U. S., at 767, a category that is narrower&para;<br>than restraint of trade. Monopoly power may be equally&para;<br>harmful whether it is the product of joint action or indi­&para;<br>vidual action.&para;<br>Congress used this distinction between concerted and&para;<br>independent action to deter anticompetitive conduct and&para;<br>compensate its victims, without chilling vigorous competi­&para;<br>tion through ordinary business operations. The distinc­&para;<br>tion also avoids judicial scrutiny of routine, internal busi­&para;<br>ness decisions.&para;<br>Thus, in §1 Congress “treated concerted behavior more&para;<br>strictly than unilateral behavior.” Id., at 768. This is so&para;<br>because unlike independent action, “[c]oncerted activity&para;<br>inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk” insofar as&para;<br>it “deprives the marketplace of independent centers of&para;<br>decisionmaking that competition assumes and demands.”&para;<br>Id., at 768–769. And because concerted action is discrete&para;<br>and distinct, a limit on such activity leaves untouched a&para;<br>vast amount of business conduct. As a result, there is less&para;<br>risk of deterring a firm’s necessary conduct; courts need&para;<br>only examine discrete agreements; and such conduct may&para;<br>be remedied simply through prohibition.2 See Areeda &amp;&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 If&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress prohibited independent action that merely restrains&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v. NATIONAL &para;<br>&para;<br>FOOTBALL LEAGUE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court &para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>Hovenkamp ¶1464c, at 206. Concerted activity is thus&para;<br>“judged more sternly than unilateral activity under §2,”&para;<br>Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 768. For these reasons, §1&para;<br>prohibits any concerted action “in restraint of trade or&para;<br>commerce,” even if the action does not “threate[n] monopo­&para;<br>lization,” Ibid. And therefore, an arrangement must&para;<br>embody concerted action in order to be a “contract, combi­&para;<br>nation . . . or conspiracy” under §1.&para;<br>III&para;<br>We have long held that concerted action under §1 does&para;<br>not turn simply on whether the parties involved are le­&para;<br>gally distinct entities. Instead, we have eschewed such&para;<br>formalistic distinctions in favor of a functional considera­&para;<br>tion of how the parties involved in the alleged anticom­&para;<br>petitive conduct actually operate.&para;<br>As a result, we have repeatedly found instances in&para;<br>which members of a legally single entity violated §1 when&para;<br>the entity was controlled by a group of competitors and&para;<br>served, in essence, as a vehicle for ongoing concerted&para;<br>activity. In United States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U. S. 350&para;<br>(1967), for example, a group of mattress manufacturers&para;<br>operated and controlled Sealy, Inc., a company that li­&para;<br>censed the Sealy trademark to the manufacturers, and&para;<br>——————&para;<br>trade (even if it does not threaten monopolization), that prohibition&para;<br>could deter perfectly competitive conduct by firms that are fearful of&para;<br>litigation costs and judicial error. See Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 768&para;<br>(“Judging unilateral conduct in this manner reduces the risk that the&para;<br>antitrust laws will dampen the competitive zeal of a single aggressive&para;<br>competitor”); cf. United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U. S.&para;<br>422, 441 (1978) (“[S]alutary and procompetitive conduct . . . might be&para;<br>shunned by businessmen who chose to be excessively cautious in the&para;<br>face of uncertainty”). Moreover, if every unilateral action that re­&para;<br>strained trade were subject to antitrust scrutiny, then courts would be&para;<br>forced to judge almost every internal business decision. See 7 P.&para;<br>Areeda &amp; H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶1464c, at 206 (2d ed. 2003)&para;<br>(hereinafter Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp) (unilateral behavior is “often&para;<br>difficult to evaluate or remedy”).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

The Government alleged that the&para;<br>licensees and Sealy were conspiring in violation of §1, and&para;<br>we agreed. Id., at 352–354. We explained that “[w]e seek&para;<br>the central substance of the situation” and therefore “we&para;<br>are moved by the identity of the persons who act, rather&para;<br>than the label of their hats.” Id., at 353. We thus held&para;<br>that Sealy was not a “separate entity, but . . . an instru­&para;<br>mentality of the individual manufacturers.” Id., at 356.&para;<br>In similar circumstances, we have found other formally&para;<br>distinct business organizations covered by §1. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery&para;<br>&amp; Printing Co., 472 U. S. 284 (1985); National Collegiate&para;<br>Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468&para;<br>U. S. 85 (1984) (NCAA); United States v. Topco Associates,&para;<br>Inc., 405 U. S. 596, 609 (1972); Associated Press v.

We have similarly looked&para;<br>past the form of a legally “single entity” when competitors&para;<br>were part of professional organizations3 or trade groups.4&para;<br>Conversely, there is not necessarily concerted action&para;<br>simply because more than one legally distinct entity is&para;<br>involved. Although, under a now-defunct doctrine known&para;<br>as the “intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine,” we once&para;<br>treated cooperation between legally separate entities as&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 See,&para;<br>&para;<br>e.g., FTC v.

In United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.

The&para;<br>mere fact that the teams operate jointly in some sense&para;<br>does not mean that they are immune.7&para;<br>The question whether NFLP decisions can constitute&para;<br>concerted activity covered by §1 is closer than whether&para;<br>decisions made directly by the 32 teams are covered by §1.&para;<br>This is so both because NFLP is a separate corporation&para;<br>with its own management and because the record indi­&para;<br>cates that most of the revenues generated by NFLP are&para;<br>shared by the teams on an equal basis. Nevertheless we&para;<br>think it clear that for the same reasons the 32 teams’&para;<br>conduct is covered by §1, NFLP’s actions also are subject&para;<br>to §1, at least with regards to its marketing of property&para;<br>owned by the separate teams. NFLP’s licensing decisions&para;<br>are made by the 32 potential competitors, and each of&para;<br>them actually owns its share of the jointly managed as­&para;<br>sets. Cf. Sealy, 388 U. S., at 352–354. Apart from their&para;<br>agreement to cooperate in exploiting those assets, includ­&para;<br>ing their decisions as the NFLP, there would be nothing to&para;<br>prevent each of the teams from making its own market&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 In any event, it simply is not apparent that the alleged conduct was&para;<br>necessary at all. Although two teams are needed to play a football&para;<br>game, not all aspects of elaborate interleague cooperation are necessary&para;<br>to produce a game. Moreover, even if leaguewide agreements are&para;<br>necessary to produce football, it does not follow that concerted activity&para;<br>in marketing intellectual property is necessary to produce football.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals carved out a zone of antitrust immunity for&para;<br>conduct arguably related to league operations by reasoning that coordi­&para;<br>nated team trademark sales are necessary to produce “NFL football,” a&para;<br>single NFL brand that competes against other forms of entertainment.&para;<br>But defining the product as “NFL football” puts the cart before the&para;<br>horse: Of course the NFL produces NFL football; but that does not&para;<br>mean that cooperation amongst NFL teams is immune from §1 scru­&para;<br>tiny.

Agree­&para;<br>ments made within a firm can constitute concerted action&para;<br>covered by §1 when the parties to the agreement act on&para;<br>interests separate from those of the firm itself,8 and the&para;<br>intrafirm agreements may simply be a formalistic shell for&para;<br>ongoing concerted action.

To determine&para;<br>that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to&para;<br>the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and&para;<br>after the restraint is imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect,&para;<br>actual or probable.
