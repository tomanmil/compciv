NICASTRO, &para;<br>&para;<br>INDIVIDUALLY AND AS ADMINISTRATOR OF&para;<br>&para;<br>THE ESTATE OF NICASTRO&para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY&para;<br>No. 09–1343. Argued January 11, 2011—Decided June 27, 2011&para;<br>Respondent Nicastro injured his hand while using a metal-shearing&para;<br>machine that petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre),&para;<br>manufactured in England, where the company is incorporated and&para;<br>operates. Nicastro filed this products-liability suit in a state court in&para;<br>New Jersey, where the accident occurred, but J. McIntyre sought to&para;<br>dismiss the suit for want of personal jurisdiction. Nicastro’s jurisdic&para;<br>tional claim was based on three primary facts: A U. S. distributor&para;<br>agreed to sell J. McIntyre’s machines in this country; J. McIntyre of&para;<br>ficials attended trade shows in several States, albeit not in New Jer&para;<br>sey; and no more than four J. McIntyre machines (the record suggests&para;<br>only one), including the one at issue, ended up in New Jersey. The&para;<br>State Supreme Court held that New Jersey’s courts can exercise ju&para;<br>risdiction over a foreign manufacturer without contravening the&para;<br>Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause so long as the manu&para;<br>facturer knew or reasonably should have known that its products are&para;<br>distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead&para;<br>to sales in any of the States. Invoking this “stream-of-commerce”&para;<br>doctrine of jurisdiction, the court relied in part on Asahi Metal Indus&para;<br>try Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102. Apply&para;<br>ing its test, the court concluded that J. McIntyre was subject to juris&para;<br>diction in New Jersey, even though at no time had it advertised in,&para;<br>sent goods to, or in any relevant sense targeted the State.&para;<br>Held: The judgment is reversed.&para;<br>201 N. J. 48, 987 A. 2d 575, reversed.&para;<br>JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA,&para;<br>and JUSTICE THOMAS, concluded that because J. McIntyre never en&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>gaged in any activities in New Jersey that revealed an intent to in&para;<br>voke or benefit from the protection of the State’s laws, New Jersey is&para;<br>without power to adjudge the company’s rights and liabilities, and its&para;<br>exercise of jurisdiction would violate due process. Pp. 4–12.&para;<br>(a) Due process protects the defendant’s right not to be coerced ex&para;<br>cept by lawful judicial power. A court may subject a defendant to&para;<br>judgment only when the defendant has sufficient contacts with the&para;<br>sovereign “such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ‘tra&para;<br>ditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’ ” International&para;<br>Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316. Freeform fundamental&para;<br>fairness notions divorced from traditional practice cannot transform a&para;<br>judgment rendered without authority into law. As a general rule, the&para;<br>sovereign’s exercise of power requires some act by which the defen&para;<br>dant “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activi&para;<br>ties within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protec&para;<br>tions of its laws.” Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235, 253. In cases&para;<br>like this one, it is the defendant’s purposeful availment that makes&para;<br>jurisdiction consistent with “fair play and substantial justice” no&para;<br>tions. No “stream-of-commerce” doctrine can displace that general&para;<br>rule for products-liability cases.&para;<br>The rules and standards for determining state jurisdiction over an&para;<br>absent party have been unclear because of decades-old questions left&para;<br>open in Asahi. The imprecision arising from Asahi, for the most part,&para;<br>results from its statement of the relation between jurisdiction and&para;<br>the “stream of commerce.” That concept, like other metaphors, has&para;<br>its deficiencies as well as its utilities. It refers to the movement of&para;<br>goods from manufacturers through distributors to consumers, yet be&para;<br>yond that descriptive purpose its meaning is far from exact. A defen&para;<br>dant’s placement of goods into commerce “with the expectation that&para;<br>they will be purchased by consumers within the forum State” may&para;<br>indicate purposeful availment. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.&para;<br>Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 298. But that does not amend the general&para;<br>rule of personal jurisdiction. The principal inquiry in cases of this&para;<br>sort is whether the defendant’s activities manifest an intention to&para;<br>submit to the power of a sovereign. See, e.g., Hanson, supra, at 253.&para;<br>In Asahi, Justice Brennan’s concurrence (joined by three other Jus&para;<br>tices) discarded the central concept of sovereign authority in favor of&para;<br>fairness and foreseeability considerations on the theory that the de&para;<br>fendant’s ability to anticipate suit is the touchstone of jurisdiction.&para;<br>480 U. S., at 117. However, Justice O’Connor’s lead opinion (also for&para;<br>four Justices) stated that “[t]he ‘substantial connection’ between the&para;<br>defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding of minimum&para;<br>contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully&para;<br>directed toward the forum State.” Id., at 112. Since Asahi, the courts&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>have sought to reconcile the competing opinions. But Justice Bren&para;<br>nan’s rule based on general notions of fairness and foreseeability is&para;<br>inconsistent with the premises of lawful judicial power under this&para;<br>Court’s precedents. Today’s conclusion that the authority to subject a&para;<br>defendant to judgment depends on purposeful availment is consistent&para;<br>with Justice O’Connor’s Asahi opinion. Pp. 4–10.&para;<br>(b) Nicastro has not established that J. McIntyre engaged in con&para;<br>duct purposefully directed at New Jersey. The company had no office&para;<br>in New Jersey; it neither paid taxes nor owned property there; and it&para;<br>neither advertised in, nor sent any employees to, the State. Indeed,&para;<br>the trial court found that petitioner did not have a single contact with&para;<br>the State apart from the fact that the machine in question ended up&para;<br>there. Neither these facts, nor the three on which Nicastro centered&para;<br>his jurisdictional claim, show that J. McIntyre purposefully availed&para;<br>itself of the New Jersey market. Pp. 10–12.&para;<br>JUSTICE BREYER, joined by JUSTICE ALITO, agreed that the New Jer&para;<br>sey Supreme Court’s judgment must be reversed, but concluded that&para;<br>because this case does not present issues arising from recent changes&para;<br>in commerce and communication, it is unwise to announce a rule of&para;<br>broad applicability without fully considering modern-day conse&para;<br>quences. Rather, the outcome of the case is determined by the&para;<br>Court’s precedents. Pp. 2–7.&para;<br>(a) Based on the record, respondent Nicastro failed to meet his&para;<br>burden to demonstrate that it was constitutionally proper to exercise&para;<br>jurisdiction over petitioner J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (British&para;<br>Manufacturer). The three primary facts the state high court relied&para;<br>on do not satisfy due process. None of the Court’s precedents finds&para;<br>that a single isolated sale, even if accompanied by the kind of sales&para;<br>effort indicated here, is sufficient. See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.&para;<br>v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286; Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior&para;<br>Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102. Here, the relevant facts&para;<br>show no “regular . . . flow” or “regular course” of sales in New Jersey,&para;<br>id., at 117 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg&para;<br>ment); id., at 122 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in&para;<br>judgment); and there is no “something more,” such as special state&para;<br>related design, advertising, advice, or marketing, id., at 111, 112&para;<br>(opinion of O’Connor, J.), that would warrant the assertion of juris&para;<br>diction. Nicastro has shown no specific effort by the British Manu&para;<br>facturer to sell in New Jersey. And he has not otherwise shown that&para;<br>the British Manufacturer “ ‘purposefully avail[ed] itself of the privi&para;<br>lege of conducting activities’ ” within New Jersey, or that it delivered&para;<br>its goods in the stream of commerce “with the expectation that they&para;<br>will be purchased” by New Jersey users. World-Wide Volkswagen,&para;<br>supra, at 297–298. Pp. 2–4.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>(b) JUSTICE BREYER would not go further. Because the incident at&para;<br>issue does not implicate modern concerns, and because the factual re&para;<br>cord leaves many open questions, this is an unsuitable vehicle for&para;<br>making broad pronouncements that refashion basic jurisdictional&para;<br>rules. At a minimum, he would not work such a change to the law in&para;<br>the way either the plurality or the New Jersey Supreme Court sug&para;<br>gests without a better understanding of the relevant contemporary&para;<br>commercial circumstances. Insofar as such considerations are rele&para;<br>vant to any change in present law, they might be presented in a case&para;<br>(unlike the present one) in which the Solicitor General participates.&para;<br>Pp. 4–7.&para;<br>&para;<br>KENNEDY, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an&para;<br>opinion, in which ROBERTS, C.

The rules and stan&para;<br>dards for determining when a State does or does not have&para;<br>jurisdiction over an absent party have been unclear be&para;<br>cause of decades-old questions left open in Asahi Metal&para;<br>Industry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480&para;<br>U. S. 102 (1987).&para;<br>Here, the Supreme Court of New Jersey, relying in part&para;<br>on Asahi, held that New Jersey’s courts can exercise juris&para;<br>diction over a foreign manufacturer of a product so long as&para;<br>the manufacturer “knows or reasonably should know that&para;<br>its products are distributed through a nationwide distribu&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>tion system that might lead to those products being sold in&para;<br>any of the fifty states.” Nicastro v. McIntyre Machinery&para;<br>America, Ltd., 201 N. J. 48, 76, 77, 987 A. 2d 575, 591, 592&para;<br>(2010). Applying that test, the court concluded that a&para;<br>British manufacturer of scrap metal machines was subject&para;<br>to jurisdiction in New Jersey, even though at no time had&para;<br>it advertised in, sent goods to, or in any relevant sense&para;<br>targeted the State.&para;<br>That decision cannot be sustained. Although the New&para;<br>Jersey Supreme Court issued an extensive opinion with care&para;<br>ful attention to this Court’s cases and to its own pre&para;<br>cedent, the “stream of commerce” metaphor carried the&para;<br>decision far afield. Due process protects the defendant’s&para;<br>right not to be coerced except by lawful judicial power. As&para;<br>a general rule, the exercise of judicial power is not lawful&para;<br>unless the defendant “purposefully avails itself of the&para;<br>privilege of conducting activities within the forum State,&para;<br>thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.”&para;<br>Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235, 253 (1958). There may&para;<br>be exceptions, say, for instance, in cases involving an&para;<br>intentional tort. But the general rule is applicable in this&para;<br>products-liability case, and the so-called “stream-of&para;<br>commerce” doctrine cannot displace it.&para;<br>I&para;<br>This case arises from a products-liability suit filed in&para;<br>New Jersey state court. Robert Nicastro seriously injured&para;<br>his hand while using a metal-shearing machine manufac&para;<br>tured by J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. (J. McIntyre). The&para;<br>accident occurred in New Jersey, but the machine was&para;<br>manufactured in England, where J. McIntyre is incorpo&para;<br>rated and operates. The question here is whether the New&para;<br>Jersey courts have jurisdiction over J. McIntyre, notwith&para;<br>standing the fact that the company at no time either&para;<br>marketed goods in the State or shipped them there. Ni&para;<br>castro was a plaintiff in the New Jersey trial court and is&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>the respondent here; J. McIntyre was a defendant and is&para;<br>now the petitioner.&para;<br>At oral argument in this Court, Nicastro’s counsel&para;<br>stressed three primary facts in defense of New Jersey’s as&para;<br>sertion of jurisdiction over J. McIntyre. See Tr. of Oral&para;<br>Arg. 29–30.&para;<br>First, an independent company agreed to sell J. McIn&para;<br>tyre’s machines in the United States. J. McIntyre itself&para;<br>did not sell its machines to buyers in this country beyond&para;<br>the U. S. distributor, and there is no allegation that the&para;<br>distributor was under J. McIntyre’s control.&para;<br>Second, J. McIntyre officials attended annual conven&para;<br>tions for the scrap recycling industry to advertise J. McIntyre’s machines alongside the distributor. The conven&para;<br>tions took place in various States, but never in New&para;<br>Jersey.&para;<br>Third, no more than four machines (the record suggests&para;<br>only one, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 130a), including the&para;<br>machine that caused the injuries that are the basis for this&para;<br>suit, ended up in New Jersey.&para;<br>In addition to these facts emphasized by respondent, the&para;<br>New Jersey Supreme Court noted that J. McIntyre held&para;<br>both United States and European patents on its recycling&para;<br>technology. 201 N. J., at 55, 987 A. 2d, at 579. It also&para;<br>noted that the U. S. distributor “structured [its] adver&para;<br>tising and sales efforts in accordance with” J. McIntyre’s&para;<br>“direction and guidance whenever possible,” and that “at&para;<br>least some of the machines were sold on consignment to”&para;<br>the distributor. Id., at 55, 56, 987 A. 2d, at 579 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted).&para;<br>In light of these facts, the New Jersey Supreme Court&para;<br>concluded that New Jersey courts could exercise jurisdic&para;<br>tion over petitioner without contravention of the Due&para;<br>Process Clause. Jurisdiction was proper, in that court’s&para;<br>view, because the injury occurred in New Jersey; because&para;<br>petitioner knew or reasonably should have known “that its&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>products are distributed through a nationwide distribution&para;<br>system that might lead to those products being sold in any&para;<br>of the fifty states”; and because petitioner failed to “take&para;<br>some reasonable step to prevent the distribution of its prod&para;<br>ucts in this State.” Id., at 77, 987 A. 2d, at 592.&para;<br>Both the New Jersey Supreme Court’s holding and its&para;<br>account of what it called “[t]he stream-of-commerce doc&para;<br>trine of jurisdiction,” id., at 80, 987 A. 2d, at 594, were&para;<br>incorrect, however. This Court’s Asahi decision may be&para;<br>responsible in part for that court’s error regarding the&para;<br>stream of commerce, and this case presents an opportunity&para;<br>to provide greater clarity.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Due Process Clause protects an individual’s right to&para;<br>be deprived of life, liberty, or property only by the exercise&para;<br>of lawful power. Cf. Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U. S.&para;<br>399, 403 (1966) (The Clause “protect[s] a person against&para;<br>having the Government impose burdens upon him except&para;<br>in accordance with the valid laws of the land”). This is no&para;<br>less true with respect to the power of a sovereign to re&para;<br>solve disputes through judicial process than with respect&para;<br>to the power of a sovereign to prescribe rules of conduct for&para;<br>those within its sphere. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Bet&para;<br>ter Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 94 (1998) (“Jurisdiction is&para;<br>power to declare the law”). As a general rule, neither&para;<br>statute nor judicial decree may bind strangers to the&para;<br>State. Cf. Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of&para;<br>Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 608–609 (1990) (opinion of SCALIA,&para;<br>J.) (invoking “the phrase coram non judice, ‘before a per&para;<br>son not a judge’—meaning, in effect, that the proceeding&para;<br>in question was not a judicial proceeding because lawful&para;<br>judicial authority was not present, and could therefore not&para;<br>yield a judgment”)&para;<br>A court may subject a defendant to judgment only when&para;<br>the defendant has sufficient contacts with the sovereign&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>“such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend&para;<br>‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’ ”&para;<br>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316&para;<br>(1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457, 463&para;<br>(1940)). Freeform notions of fundamental fairness di&para;<br>vorced from traditional practice cannot transform a judg&para;<br>ment rendered in the absence of authority into law. As a&para;<br>general rule, the sovereign’s exercise of power requires&para;<br>some act by which the defendant “purposefully avails itself&para;<br>of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum&para;<br>State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its&para;<br>laws,” Hanson, 357 U. S., at 253, though in some cases, as&para;<br>with an intentional tort, the defendant might well fall&para;<br>within the State’s authority by reason of his attempt to&para;<br>obstruct its laws. In products-liability cases like this one,&para;<br>it is the defendant’s purposeful availment that makes&para;<br>jurisdiction consistent with “traditional notions of fair play&para;<br>and substantial justice.”&para;<br>A person may submit to a State’s authority in a number&para;<br>of ways. There is, of course, explicit consent. E.g., In&para;<br>surance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de&para;<br>Guinee, 456 U. S. 694, 703 (1982). Presence within a State&para;<br>at the time suit commences through service of process is&para;<br>another example. See Burnham, supra. Citizenship or&para;<br>domicile—or, by analogy, incorporation or principal place&para;<br>of business for corporations—also indicates general sub&para;<br>mission to a State’s powers. Goodyear Dunlop Tires Op&para;<br>erations, S. A. v. Brown, post, p. __. Each of these exam&para;<br>ples reveals circumstances, or a course of conduct, from&para;<br>which it is proper to infer an intention to benefit from and&para;<br>thus an intention to submit to the laws of the forum State.&para;<br>Cf. Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 476&para;<br>(1985). These examples support exercise of the general&para;<br>jurisdiction of the State’s courts and allow the State to&para;<br>resolve both matters that originate within the State and&para;<br>those based on activities and events elsewhere. Helicop&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>teros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408,&para;<br>414, and n. 9 (1984). By contrast, those who live or oper&para;<br>ate primarily outside a State have a due process right not&para;<br>to be subjected to judgment in its courts as a general&para;<br>matter.&para;<br>There is also a more limited form of submission to a&para;<br>State’s authority for disputes that “arise out of or are con&para;<br>nected with the activities within the state.” International&para;<br>Shoe Co., supra, at 319. Where a defendant “purposefully&para;<br>avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within&para;<br>the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and&para;<br>protections of its laws,” Hanson, supra, at 253, it submits&para;<br>to the judicial power of an otherwise foreign sovereign to&para;<br>the extent that power is exercised in connection with the&para;<br>defendant’s activities touching on the State. In other&para;<br>words, submission through contact with and activity&para;<br>directed at a sovereign may justify specific jurisdiction “in&para;<br>a suit arising out of or related to the defendant’s contacts&para;<br>with the forum.” Helicopteros, supra, at 414, n. 8; see also&para;<br>Goodyear, post, at 2.&para;<br>The imprecision arising from Asahi, for the most part,&para;<br>results from its statement of the relation between jurisdic&para;<br>tion and the “stream of commerce.” The stream of com&para;<br>merce, like other metaphors, has its deficiencies as well as&para;<br>its utility. It refers to the movement of goods from manu&para;<br>facturers through distributors to consumers, yet beyond&para;<br>that descriptive purpose its meaning is far from exact.&para;<br>This Court has stated that a defendant’s placing goods&para;<br>into the stream of commerce “with the expectation that&para;<br>they will be purchased by consumers within the forum&para;<br>State” may indicate purposeful availment. World-Wide&para;<br>Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 298 (1980)&para;<br>(finding that expectation lacking). But that statement&para;<br>does not amend the general rule of personal jurisdiction.&para;<br>It merely observes that a defendant may in an appropriate&para;<br>case be subject to jurisdiction without entering the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>forum—itself an unexceptional proposition—as where man&para;<br>ufacturers or distributors “seek to serve” a given State’s&para;<br>market. Id., at 295. The principal inquiry in cases of&para;<br>this sort is whether the defendant’s activities manifest&para;<br>an intention to submit to the power of a sovereign. In&para;<br>other words, the defendant must “purposefully avai[l] it&para;<br>self of the privilege of conducting activities within the&para;<br>forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of&para;<br>its laws.” Hanson, supra, at 253; Insurance Corp., supra,&para;<br>at 704–705 (“[A]ctions of the defendant may amount to a&para;<br>legal submission to the jurisdiction of the court”). Some&para;<br>times a defendant does so by sending its goods rather than&para;<br>its agents. The defendant’s transmission of goods permits&para;<br>the exercise of jurisdiction only where the defendant can&para;<br>be said to have targeted the forum; as a general rule, it is&para;<br>not enough that the defendant might have predicted that&para;<br>its goods will reach the forum State.&para;<br>In Asahi, an opinion by Justice Brennan for four Jus&para;<br>tices outlined a different approach. It discarded the cen&para;<br>tral concept of sovereign authority in favor of considera&para;<br>tions of fairness and foreseeability. As that concurrence&para;<br>contended, “jurisdiction premised on the placement of a&para;<br>product into the stream of commerce [without more] is&para;<br>consistent with the Due Process Clause,” for “[a]s long as a&para;<br>participant in this process is aware that the final product&para;<br>is being marketed in the forum State, the possibility of a&para;<br>lawsuit there cannot come as a surprise.” 480 U. S., at&para;<br>117 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judg&para;<br>ment). It was the premise of the concurring opinion that&para;<br>the defendant’s ability to anticipate suit renders the asser&para;<br>tion of jurisdiction fair. In this way, the opinion made&para;<br>foreseeability the touchstone of jurisdiction.&para;<br>The standard set forth in Justice Brennan’s concurrence&para;<br>was rejected in an opinion written by Justice O’Connor;&para;<br>but the relevant part of that opinion, too, commanded the&para;<br>assent of only four Justices, not a majority of the Court.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>That opinion stated: “The ‘substantial connection’ between&para;<br>the defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding&para;<br>of minimum contacts must come about by an action of the&para;<br>defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.&para;<br>The placement of a product into the stream of commerce,&para;<br>without more, is not an act of the defendant purposefully&para;<br>directed toward the forum State.” Id., at 112 (emphasis&para;<br>deleted; citations omitted).&para;<br>Since Asahi was decided, the courts have sought to rec&para;<br>oncile the competing opinions. But Justice Brennan’s con&para;<br>currence, advocating a rule based on general notions of&para;<br>fairness and foreseeability, is inconsistent with the prem&para;<br>ises of lawful judicial power. This Court’s precedents&para;<br>make clear that it is the defendant’s actions, not his expec&para;<br>tations, that empower a State’s courts to subject him to&para;<br>judgment.&para;<br>The conclusion that jurisdiction is in the first instance&para;<br>a question of authority rather than fairness explains, for&para;<br>example, why the principal opinion in Burnham “con&para;<br>ducted no independent inquiry into the desirability or&para;<br>fairness” of the rule that service of process within a State&para;<br>suffices to establish jurisdiction over an otherwise foreign&para;<br>defendant. 495 U.

As that opinion explained,&para;<br>“[t]he view developed early that each State had the power&para;<br>to hale before its courts any individual who could be found&para;<br>within its borders.” Id., at 610. Furthermore, were gen&para;<br>eral fairness considerations the touchstone of jurisdiction,&para;<br>a lack of purposeful availment might be excused where&para;<br>carefully crafted judicial procedures could otherwise pro&para;<br>tect the defendant’s interests, or where the plaintiff would&para;<br>suffer substantial hardship if forced to litigate in a foreign&para;<br>forum. That such considerations have not been deemed&para;<br>controlling is instructive. See, e.g., World-Wide Volks&para;<br>wagen, supra, at 294.&para;<br>Two principles are implicit in the foregoing. First, per&para;<br>sonal jurisdiction requires a forum-by-forum, or sovereign&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>by-sovereign, analysis. The question is whether a de&para;<br>fendant has followed a course of conduct directed at the&para;<br>society or economy existing within the jurisdiction of a&para;<br>given sovereign, so that the sovereign has the power to&para;<br>subject the defendant to judgment concerning that con&para;<br>duct. Personal jurisdiction, of course, restricts “judicial&para;<br>power not as a matter of sovereignty, but as a matter of&para;<br>individual liberty,” for due process protects the individ&para;<br>ual’s right to be subject only to lawful power. Insurance&para;<br>Corp., 456 U. S., at 702. But whether a judicial judgment&para;<br>is lawful depends on whether the sovereign has authority&para;<br>to render it.&para;<br>The second principle is a corollary of the first. Because&para;<br>the United States is a distinct sovereign, a defendant may&para;<br>in principle be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of&para;<br>the United States but not of any particular State. This is&para;<br>consistent with the premises and unique genius of our&para;<br>Constitution. Ours is “a legal system unprecedented in&para;<br>form and design, establishing two orders of government,&para;<br>each with its own direct relationship, its own privity, its&para;<br>own set of mutual rights and obligations to the people who&para;<br>sustain it and are governed by it.” U. S. Term Limits,&para;<br>Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 838 (1995) (KENNEDY, J.,&para;<br>concurring). For jurisdiction, a litigant may have the&para;<br>requisite relationship with the United States Government&para;<br>but not with the government of any individual State. That&para;<br>would be an exceptional case, however. If the defendant is&para;<br>a domestic domiciliary, the courts of its home State are&para;<br>available and can exercise general jurisdiction. And if&para;<br>another State were to assert jurisdiction in an inappropri&para;<br>ate case, it would upset the federal balance, which posits&para;<br>that each State has a sovereignty that is not subject to&para;<br>unlawful intrusion by other States. Furthermore, foreign&para;<br>corporations will often target or concentrate on particular&para;<br>States, subjecting them to specific jurisdiction in those&para;<br>forums.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>J. MCINTYRE MACHINERY, LTD. v. NICASTRO&para;<br>Opinion of KENNEDY, J.&para;<br>&para;<br>It must be remembered, however, that although this&para;<br>case and Asahi both involve foreign manufacturers, the&para;<br>undesirable consequences of Justice Brennan’s approach&para;<br>are no less significant for domestic producers. The owner&para;<br>of a small Florida farm might sell crops to a large nearby&para;<br>distributor, for example, who might then distribute them&para;<br>to grocers across the country. If foreseeability were the&para;<br>controlling criterion, the farmer could be sued in Alaska or&para;<br>any number of other States’ courts without ever leaving&para;<br>town. And the issue of foreseeability may itself be con&para;<br>tested so that significant expenses are incurred just on the&para;<br>preliminary issue of jurisdiction. Jurisdictional rules&para;<br>should avoid these costs whenever possible.&para;<br>The conclusion that the authority to subject a defendant&para;<br>to judgment depends on purposeful availment, consistent&para;<br>with Justice O’Connor’s opinion in Asahi, does not by itself&para;<br>resolve many difficult questions of jurisdiction that will&para;<br>arise in particular cases. The defendant’s conduct and&para;<br>the economic realities of the market the defendant seeks&para;<br>to serve will differ across cases, and judicial exposition&para;<br>will, in common-law fashion, clarify the contours of that&para;<br>principle.&para;<br>III&para;<br>In this case, petitioner directed marketing and sales&para;<br>efforts at the United States. It may be that, assuming it&para;<br>were otherwise empowered to legislate on the subject, the&para;<br>Congress could authorize the exercise of jurisdiction in&para;<br>appropriate courts. That circumstance is not presented in&para;<br>this case, however, and it is neither necessary nor appro&para;<br>priate to address here any constitutional concerns that&para;<br>might be attendant to that exercise of power. See Asahi,&para;<br>480 U. S., at 113, n. Nor is it necessary to determine what&para;<br>substantive law might apply were Congress to authorize&para;<br>jurisdiction in a federal court in New Jersey.

A sovereign’s legislative authority to&para;<br>regulate conduct may present considerations different&para;<br>from those presented by its authority to subject a defen&para;<br>dant to judgment in its courts. Here the question concerns&para;<br>the authority of a New Jersey state court to exercise ju&para;<br>risdiction, so it is petitioner’s purposeful contacts with&para;<br>New Jersey, not with the United States, that alone are&para;<br>relevant.&para;<br>Respondent has not established that J. McIntyre en&para;<br>gaged in conduct purposefully directed at New Jersey.&para;<br>Recall that respondent’s claim of jurisdiction centers on&para;<br>three facts: The distributor agreed to sell J. McIntyre’s&para;<br>machines in the United States; J. McIntyre officials at&para;<br>tended trade shows in several States but not in New Jer&para;<br>sey; and up to four machines ended up in New Jersey. The&para;<br>British manufacturer had no office in New Jersey; it nei&para;<br>ther paid taxes nor owned property there; and it neither&para;<br>advertised in, nor sent any employees to, the State. In&para;<br>deed, after discovery the trial court found that the “defen&para;<br>dant does not have a single contact with New Jersey short&para;<br>of the machine in question ending up in this state.” App.&para;<br>to Pet. for Cert. 130a. These facts may reveal an intent to&para;<br>serve the U. S. market, but they do not show that J. McIn&para;<br>tyre purposefully availed itself of the New Jersey market.&para;<br>It is notable that the New Jersey Supreme Court ap&para;<br>pears to agree, for it could “not find that J. McIntyre had a&para;<br>presence or minimum contacts in this State—in any juris&para;<br>prudential sense—that would justify a New Jersey court&para;<br>to exercise jurisdiction in this case.” 201 N. J., at 61, 987&para;<br>A. 2d, at 582. The court nonetheless held that petitioner&para;<br>could be sued in New Jersey based on a “stream-of&para;<br>commerce theory of jurisdiction.” Ibid. As discussed,&para;<br>however, the stream-of-commerce metaphor cannot super&para;<br>sede either the mandate of the Due Process Clause or the&para;<br>limits on judicial authority that Clause ensures.

So I think it unwise to an&para;<br>nounce a rule of broad applicability without full considera&para;<br>tion of the modern-day consequences.&para;<br>In my view, the outcome of this case is determined by&para;<br>our precedents. Based on the facts found by the New&para;<br>Jersey courts, respondent Robert Nicastro failed to meet&para;<br>his burden to demonstrate that it was constitutionally&para;<br>proper to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner J. McIntyre&para;<br>Machinery, Ltd. (British Manufacturer), a British firm&para;<br>that manufactures scrap-metal machines in Great Britain&para;<br>and sells them through an independent distributor in the&para;<br>United States (American Distributor).

NICASTRO&para;<br>BREYER, J., concurring in judgment&para;<br>&para;<br>agree with the plurality that the contrary judgment of the&para;<br>Supreme Court of New Jersey should be reversed.&para;<br>I&para;<br>In asserting jurisdiction over the British Manufacturer,&para;<br>the Supreme Court of New Jersey relied most heavily on&para;<br>three primary facts as providing constitutionally sufficient&para;<br>“contacts” with New Jersey, thereby making it fundamentally fair to hale the British Manufacturer before its&para;<br>courts: (1) The American Distributor on one occasion sold&para;<br>and shipped one machine to a New Jersey customer,&para;<br>namely, Mr. Nicastro’s employer, Mr. Curcio; (2) the Brit&para;<br>ish Manufacturer permitted, indeed wanted, its independ&para;<br>ent American Distributor to sell its machines to anyone in&para;<br>America willing to buy them; and (3) representatives of&para;<br>the British Manufacturer attended trade shows in “such&para;<br>cities as Chicago, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Orlando, San&para;<br>Diego, and San Francisco.” Id., at 54–55, 987 A. 2d, at&para;<br>578–579. In my view, these facts do not provide contacts&para;<br>between the British firm and the State of New Jersey&para;<br>constitutionally sufficient to support New Jersey’s asser&para;<br>tion of jurisdiction in this case.&para;<br>None of our precedents finds that a single isolated sale,&para;<br>even if accompanied by the kind of sales effort indicated&para;<br>here, is sufficient. Rather, this Court’s previous holdings&para;<br>suggest the contrary. The Court has held that a single&para;<br>sale to a customer who takes an accident-causing product&para;<br>to a different State (where the accident takes place) is not&para;<br>a sufficient basis for asserting jurisdiction. See WorldWide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286 (1980).&para;<br>And the Court, in separate opinions, has strongly sug&para;<br>gested that a single sale of a product in a State does not&para;<br>constitute an adequate basis for asserting jurisdiction over&para;<br>an out-of-state defendant, even if that defendant places&para;<br>his goods in the stream of commerce, fully aware (and&para;<br>hoping) that such a sale will take place.

Those&para;<br>issues have serious commercial consequences but are&para;<br>totally absent in this case.&para;<br>B&para;<br>But though I do not agree with the plurality’s seemingly&para;<br>strict no-jurisdiction rule, I am not persuaded by the&para;<br>absolute approach adopted by the New Jersey Supreme&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

Under that&para;<br>view, a producer is subject to jurisdiction for a products&para;<br>liability action so long as it “knows or reasonably should&para;<br>know that its products are distributed through a nation&para;<br>wide distribution system that might lead to those products&para;<br>being sold in any of the fifty states.” 201 N. J., at 76–77,&para;<br>987 A. 2d, at 592 (emphasis added). In the context of this&para;<br>case, I cannot agree.&para;<br>For one thing, to adopt this view would abandon the&para;<br>heretofore accepted inquiry of whether, focusing upon the&para;<br>relationship between “the defendant, the forum, and the&para;<br>litigation,” it is fair, in light of the defendant’s contacts&para;<br>with that forum, to subject the defendant to suit there.&para;<br>Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186, 204 (1977) (emphasis&para;<br>added). It would ordinarily rest jurisdiction instead upon&para;<br>no more than the occurrence of a product-based accident in&para;<br>the forum State. But this Court has rejected the notion&para;<br>that a defendant’s amenability to suit “travel[s] with the&para;<br>chattel.” World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U. S., at 296.&para;<br>For another, I cannot reconcile so automatic a rule&para;<br>with the constitutional demand for “minimum contacts”&para;<br>and “purposefu[l] avail[ment],” each of which rest upon a&para;<br>particular notion of defendant-focused fairness. Id., at&para;<br>291, 297 (internal quotation marks omitted). A rule like&para;<br>the New Jersey Supreme Court’s would permit every State&para;<br>to assert jurisdiction in a products-liability suit against&para;<br>any domestic manufacturer who sells its products (made&para;<br>anywhere in the United States) to a national distributor,&para;<br>no matter how large or small the manufacturer, no matter&para;<br>how distant the forum, and no matter how few the number&para;<br>of items that end up in the particular forum at issue.&para;<br>What might appear fair in the case of a large manufac&para;<br>turer which specifically seeks, or expects, an equal-sized&para;<br>distributor to sell its product in a distant State might&para;<br>seem unfair in the case of a small manufacturer (say, an&para;<br>Appalachian potter) who sells his product (cups and sau&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>J.

I know too little about the range of these or in&para;<br>between possibilities to abandon in favor of the more&para;<br>absolute rule what has previously been this Court’s less&para;<br>absolute approach.&para;<br>Further, the fact that the defendant is a foreign, rather&para;<br>than a domestic, manufacturer makes the basic fairness&para;<br>of an absolute rule yet more uncertain. I am again less&para;<br>certain than is the New Jersey Supreme Court that the&para;<br>nature of international commerce has changed so significantly as to require a new approach to personal&para;<br>jurisdiction.&para;<br>It may be that a larger firm can readily “alleviate the&para;<br>risk of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance,&para;<br>passing the expected costs on to customers, or, if the risks&para;<br>are too great, severing its connection with the State.”&para;<br>World-Wide Volkswagen, supra, at 297. But manufactur&para;<br>ers come in many shapes and sizes. It may be fundamen&para;<br>tally unfair to require a small Egyptian shirt maker, a&para;<br>Brazilian manufacturing cooperative, or a Kenyan coffee&para;<br>farmer, selling its products through international distribu&para;<br>tors, to respond to products-liability tort suits in virtually&para;<br>every State in the United States, even those in respect to&para;<br>which the foreign firm has no connection at all but the sale&para;<br>of a single (allegedly defective) good. And a rule like the&para;<br>New Jersey Supreme Court suggests would require every&para;<br>product manufacturer, large or small, selling to American&para;<br>distributors to understand not only the tort law of every&para;<br>State, but also the wide variance in the way courts within&para;<br>different States apply that law.

App. 43a, 78a.&para;<br>In a November 23, 1999 letter to McIntyre America,&para;<br>McIntyre UK’s president spoke plainly about the manufac&para;<br>turer’s objective in authorizing the exclusive distributor&para;<br>ship: “All we wish to do is sell our products in the [United]&para;<br>States—and get paid!” Id., at 134a. Notably, McIntyre&para;<br>America was concerned about U. S. litigation involving&para;<br>McIntyre UK products, in which the distributor had been&para;<br>named as a defendant. McIntyre UK counseled McIntyre&para;<br>America to respond personally to the litigation, but reas&para;<br>sured its distributor that “the product was built and de&para;<br>signed by McIntyre Machinery in the UK and the buck&para;<br>stops here—if there’s something wrong with the machine.”&para;<br>Id., at 129a–130a. Answering jurisdictional interrogato&para;<br>ries, McIntyre UK stated that it had been named as a&para;<br>defendant in lawsuits in Illinois, Kentucky, Massachu&para;<br>setts, and West Virginia. Id., at 98a, 108a. And in corre&para;<br>spondence with McIntyre America, McIntyre UK noted&para;<br>that the manufacturer had products liability insurance&para;<br>coverage.

To achieve McIntyre&para;<br>UK’s objective, i.e., “to sell [its] machines to customers&para;<br>throughout the United States,” 399 N. J. Super., at 548,&para;<br>945 A. 2d, at 97, “the two companies [were acting] closely&para;<br>in concert with each other,” ibid. McIntyre UK never&para;<br>instructed its distributor to avoid certain States or regions&para;<br>of the country; rather, as just noted, the manufacturer&para;<br>engaged McIntyre America to attract customers “from&para;<br>anywhere in the United States.” App. 161a.&para;<br>In sum, McIntyre UK’s regular attendance and exhibi&para;<br>tions at ISRI conventions was surely a purposeful step to&para;<br>reach customers for its products “anywhere in the United&para;<br>States.” At least as purposeful was McIntyre UK’s en&para;<br>gagement of McIntyre America as the conduit for sales of&para;<br>McIntyre UK’s machines to buyers “throughout the United&para;<br>States.” Given McIntyre UK’s endeavors to reach and&para;<br>profit from the United States market as a whole, Nicas&para;<br>tro’s suit, I would hold, has been brought in a forum en&para;<br>tirely appropriate for the adjudication of his claim. He&para;<br>alleges that McIntyre UK’s shear machine was defectively&para;<br>designed or manufactured and, as a result, caused injury&para;<br>to him at his workplace. The machine arrived in Nicas&para;<br>tro’s New Jersey workplace not randomly or fortuitously,&para;<br>but as a result of the U.

See id., at&para;<br>100a–101a. McIntyre did allow that McIntyre America “may have&para;<br>resold products it purchased from [McIntyre UK] to a buyer in New&para;<br>Jersey,” id., at 117a, but said it kept no record of the ultimate destina&para;<br>tion of machines it shipped to its distributor, ibid. A private investiga&para;<br>tor engaged by Nicastro found at least one McIntyre UK machine, of&para;<br>unspecified type, in use in New Jersey. Id., at 140a–144a. But McIn&para;<br>tyre UK objected that the investigator’s report was “unsworn and based&para;<br>upon hearsay.” Reply Brief 10. Moreover, McIntyre UK maintained, no&para;<br>evidence showed that the machine the investigator found in New Jersey&para;<br>had been “sold into [that State].” Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

First, all agree, McIntyre UK surely is not subject to general (all-purpose)&para;<br>jurisdiction in New Jersey courts, for that foreign-country&para;<br>corporation is hardly “at home” in New Jersey. See Good&para;<br>year Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, post, at 2–3,&para;<br>9–13. The question, rather, is one of specific jurisdiction,&para;<br>which turns on an “affiliatio[n] between the forum and the&para;<br>underlying controversy.” Goodyear Dunlop, post, at 2&para;<br>(quoting von Mehren &amp; Trautman, Jurisdiction to Adjudi&para;<br>cate: A Suggested Analysis, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 1121, 1136&para;<br>(1966) (hereinafter von Mehren &amp; Trautman); internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted); see also Goodyear Dunlop, post,&para;<br>at 7–8.&para;<br>Second, no issue of the fair and reasonable allocation of&para;<br>adjudicatory authority among States of the United States&para;<br>is present in this case. New Jersey’s exercise of personal&para;<br>jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer whose dangerous&para;<br>product caused a workplace injury in New Jersey does not&para;<br>tread on the domain, or diminish the sovereignty, of any&para;<br>sister State. Indeed, among States of the United States,&para;<br>the State in which the injury occurred would seem most&para;<br>suitable for litigation of a products liability tort claim. See&para;<br>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286,&para;<br>297 (1980) (if a manufacturer or distributor endeavors to&para;<br>develop a market for a product in several States, it is&para;<br>reasonable “to subject it to suit in one of those States if its&para;<br>allegedly defective [product] has there been the source of&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>J.

As the Court clarified in Insurance&para;<br>Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456&para;<br>U. S. 694 (1982):&para;<br>“The restriction on state sovereign power described in&para;<br>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. . . . must be seen as ul&para;<br>timately a function of the individual liberty interest&para;<br>preserved by the Due Process Clause. That Clause is&para;<br>the only source of the personal jurisdiction require&para;<br>ment and the Clause itself makes no mention of fed&para;<br>eralism concerns. Furthermore, if the federalism con&para;<br>cept operated as an independent restriction on the&para;<br>sovereign power of the court, it would not be possible&para;<br>to waive the personal jurisdiction requirement: Indi&para;<br>vidual actions cannot change the powers of sover&para;<br>eignty, although the individual can subject himself to&para;<br>powers from which he may otherwise be protected.”&para;<br>Id., at 703, n. 10.&para;<br>See also Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186, 204, and n. 20&para;<br>(1977) (recognizing that “the mutually exclusive sover&para;<br>eignty of the States [is not] the central concern of the&para;<br>inquiry into personal jurisdiction”). But see ante, at 7&para;<br>(plurality opinion) (asserting that “sovereign authority,”&para;<br>not “fairness,” is the “central concept” in determining&para;<br>personal jurisdiction).&para;<br>Finally, in International Shoe itself, and decisions there&para;<br>after, the Court has made plain that legal fictions, notably&para;<br>“presence” and “implied consent,” should be discarded, for&para;<br>they conceal the actual bases on which jurisdiction rests.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

(“nothing is&para;<br>gained by [resort to words that] concea[l] what we do”).&para;<br>“[T]he relationship among the defendant, the forum, and&para;<br>the litigation” determines whether due process permits the&para;<br>exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant, Shaffer, 433 U.

On the road in&para;<br>Oklahoma, another car struck the Audi in the rear, caus&para;<br>ing a fire which severely burned the Audi’s occupants. Id.,&para;<br>at 288. Rejecting the Oklahoma courts’ assertion of juris&para;<br>diction over the New York dealer and distributor, this&para;<br>Court observed that the defendants had done nothing to&para;<br>serve the market for cars in Oklahoma. Id., at 295–298.&para;<br>Jurisdiction, the Court held, could not be based on the&para;<br>customer’s unilateral act of driving the vehicle to Okla&para;<br>homa. Id., at 298; see Asahi, 480 U.

(World-Wide Volkswagen “rejected the assertion that a consumer’s unilateral act of bringing the&para;<br>defendant’s product into the forum State was a sufficient&para;<br>constitutional basis for personal jurisdiction over the&para;<br>defendant”).&para;<br>Notably, the foreign manufacturer of the Audi in WorldWide Volkswagen did not object to the jurisdiction of the&para;<br>Oklahoma courts and the U.

The tube manufacturer cross-claimed against&para;<br>Asahi, the Japanese maker of the valve assembly, and&para;<br>Asahi contested the California courts’ jurisdiction. By the&para;<br>time the case reached this Court, the injured plaintiff&para;<br>had settled his case and only the indemnity claim by the&para;<br>Taiwanese company against the Japanese valve-assembly&para;<br>manufacturer remained.&para;<br>The decision was not a close call. The Court had before&para;<br>it a foreign plaintiff, the Taiwanese manufacturer, and&para;<br>a foreign defendant, the Japanese valve-assembly maker,&para;<br>and the indemnification dispute concerned a transaction&para;<br>between those parties that occurred abroad. All agreed on&para;<br>the bottom line: The Japanese valve-assembly manufac&para;<br>turer was not reasonably brought into the California&para;<br>courts to litigate a dispute with another foreign party over&para;<br>a transaction that took place outside the United States.&para;<br>Given the confines of the controversy, the dueling opin&para;<br>ions of Justice Brennan and Justice O’Connor were hardly&para;<br>necessary.
