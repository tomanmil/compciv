NEW HAMPSHIRE&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE&para;<br>No. 10–8974. Argued November 2, 2011—Decided January 11, 2012&para;<br>Around 3 a.m. on August 15, 2008, the Nashua, New Hampshire Police&para;<br>Department received a call reporting that an African-American male&para;<br>was trying to break into cars parked in the lot of the caller’s apartment building. When an officer responding to the call asked eyewitness Nubia Blandon to describe the man, Blandon pointed to her&para;<br>kitchen window and said the man she saw breaking into the car was&para;<br>standing in the parking lot, next to a police officer. Petitioner Barion&para;<br>Perry’s arrest followed this identification.&para;<br>Before trial, Perry moved to suppress Blandon’s identification on&para;<br>the ground that admitting it at trial would violate due process. The&para;<br>New Hampshire trial court denied the motion. To determine whether&para;<br>due process prohibits the introduction of an out-of-court identification&para;<br>at trial, the Superior Court said, this Court’s decisions instruct a twostep inquiry: The trial court must first decide whether the police used&para;<br>an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure; if they did, the&para;<br>court must next consider whether that procedure so tainted the resulting identification as to render it unreliable and thus inadmissible. Perry’s challenge, the court found, failed at step one, for Blandon’s identification did not result from an unnecessarily suggestive&para;<br>procedure employed by the police. A jury subsequently convicted&para;<br>Perry of theft by unauthorized taking.&para;<br>On appeal, Perry argued that the trial court erred in requiring an&para;<br>initial showing that police arranged a suggestive identification procedure. Suggestive circumstances alone, Perry contended, suffice to&para;<br>require court evaluation of the reliability of an eyewitness identification before allowing it to be presented to the jury. The New Hampshire Supreme Court rejected Perry’s argument and affirmed his&para;<br>conviction.&para;<br>Held: The Due Process Clause does not require a preliminary judicial&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>inquiry into the reliability of an eyewitness identification when the&para;<br>identification was not procured under unnecessarily suggestive circumstances arranged by law enforcement. Pp. 6–19.&para;<br>(a) The Constitution protects a defendant against a conviction&para;<br>based on evidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting introduction of the evidence, but by affording the defendant means to&para;<br>persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as unworthy of credit. Only when evidence “is so extremely unfair that its&para;<br>admission violates fundamental conceptions of justice,” Dowling v.&para;<br>United States, 493 U. S. 342, 352 (internal quotation marks omitted),&para;<br>does the Due Process Clause preclude its admission.&para;<br>Contending that the Due Process Clause is implicated here, Perry&para;<br>relies on a series of decisions involving police-arranged identification&para;<br>procedures. See Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293; Simmons v. United&para;<br>States, 390 U. S. 377; Foster v. California, 394 U. S. 440; Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188; and Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98. These&para;<br>cases detail the approach appropriately used to determine whether&para;<br>due process requires suppression of an eyewitness identification&para;<br>tainted by police arrangement. First, due process concerns arise only&para;<br>when law enforcement officers use an identification procedure that is&para;<br>both suggestive and unnecessary. Id., at 107, 109; Biggers, 409 U. S.,&para;<br>at 198. Even when the police use such a procedure, however, suppression of the resulting identification is not the inevitable consequence. Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 112–113; Biggers, 409 U. S., at&para;<br>198–199. Instead, due process requires courts to assess, on a case-bycase basis, whether improper police conduct created a “substantial&para;<br>likelihood of misidentification.” Id., at 201. “[R]eliability [of the eyewitness identification] is the linchpin” of that evaluation.&para;<br>Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 114. Where the “indicators of [a witness’]&para;<br>ability to make an accurate identification” are “outweighed by the&para;<br>corrupting effect” of law enforcement suggestion, the identification&para;<br>should be suppressed. Id., at 114, 116. Otherwise, the identification,&para;<br>assuming no other barrier to its admission, should be submitted to&para;<br>the jury. Pp. 6–10.&para;<br>(b) Perry argues that it was mere happenstance that all of the cases in the Stovall line involved improper police action. The rationale&para;<br>underlying this Court’s decisions, Perry asserts, calls for a rule requiring trial judges to prescreen eyewitness evidence for reliability&para;<br>any time an identification is made under suggestive circumstances.&para;<br>This Court disagrees.&para;<br>If “reliability is the linchpin” of admissibility under the Due Process Clause, Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 114, Perry contends, it should&para;<br>not matter whether law enforcement was responsible for creating the&para;<br>suggestive circumstances that marred the identification. This argu-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ment removes Brathwaite’s statement from its mooring, attributing&para;<br>to it a meaning that a fair reading of the opinion does not bear. The&para;<br>due process check for reliability, Brathwaite made plain, comes into&para;<br>play only after the defendant establishes improper police conduct.&para;<br>Perry’s contention also ignores a key premise of Brathwaite: A primary aim of excluding identification evidence obtained under unnecessarily suggestive circumstances is to deter law enforcement use of&para;<br>improper procedures in the first place. This deterrence rationale is&para;<br>inapposite in cases, like Perry’s, where there is no improper police&para;<br>conduct. Perry also places significant weight on United States v.&para;<br>Wade, 388 U. S. 218, describing it as a decision not anchored to improper police conduct. But the risk of police rigging was the very&para;<br>danger that prompted the Court in Wade to extend a defendant’s&para;<br>right to counsel to cover postindictment lineups and showups.&para;<br>Perry’s position would also open the door to judicial preview, under&para;<br>the banner of due process, of most, if not all, eyewitness identifications. There is no reason why an identification made by an eyewitness with poor vision or one who harbors a grudge against the defendant, for example, should be regarded as inherently more reliable&para;<br>than Blandon’s identification here. Even if this Court could, as Perry&para;<br>contends, distinguish “suggestive circumstances” from other factors&para;<br>bearing on the reliability of eyewitness evidence, Perry’s limitation&para;<br>would still involve trial courts, routinely, in preliminary examinations, for most eyewitness identifications involve some element of&para;<br>suggestion. Pp. 10–14.&para;<br>(c) In urging a broadly applicable rule, Perry maintains that eyewitness identifications are uniquely unreliable. The fallibility of&para;<br>eyewitness evidence does not, without the taint of improper state&para;<br>conduct, warrant a due process rule requiring a trial court to screen&para;<br>the evidence for reliability before allowing the jury to assess its creditworthiness. The Court’s unwillingness to adopt such a rule rests,&para;<br>in large part, on its recognition that the jury, not the judge, traditionally determines the reliability of evidence. It also takes account&para;<br>of other safeguards built into the adversary system that caution juries against placing undue weight on eyewitness testimony of questionable reliability. These protections include the defendant’s Sixth&para;<br>Amendment rights to counsel and to confront and cross-examine the&para;<br>eyewitness, eyewitness-specific instructions warning juries to take&para;<br>care in appraising identification evidence, and state and federal rules&para;<br>of evidence permitting trial judges to exclude relevant evidence if its&para;<br>probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact&para;<br>or potential for misleading the jury. Many of these safeguards were&para;<br>availed of by Perry’s defense. Given the safeguards generally applicable in criminal trials, the introduction of Blandon’s eyewitness tes-&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>timony, without a preliminary judicial assessment of its reliability,&para;<br>did not render Perry’s trial fundamentally unfair.

NEW HAMPSHIRE&para;<br>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF&para;<br>&para;<br>NEW HAMPSHIRE&para;<br>&para;<br>[January 11, 2012]&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.&para;<br>In our system of justice, fair trial for persons charged&para;<br>with criminal offenses is secured by the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees to defendants the right to counsel,&para;<br>compulsory process to obtain defense witnesses, and the&para;<br>opportunity to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution. Those safeguards apart, admission of evidence in&para;<br>state trials is ordinarily governed by state law, and the&para;<br>reliability of relevant testimony typically falls within the&para;<br>province of the jury to determine. This Court has recognized, in addition, a due process check on the admission of&para;<br>eyewitness identification, applicable when the police have&para;<br>arranged suggestive circumstances leading the witness to&para;<br>identify a particular person as the perpetrator of a crime.&para;<br>An identification infected by improper police influence,&para;<br>our case law holds, is not automatically excluded. Instead,&para;<br>the trial judge must screen the evidence for reliability&para;<br>pretrial. If there is “a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,” Simmons v. United States, 390&para;<br>U. S. 377, 384 (1968), the judge must disallow presentation of the evidence at trial. But if the indicia of reliability&para;<br>are strong enough to outweigh the corrupting effect of the&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>police-arranged suggestive circumstances, the identification evidence ordinarily will be admitted, and the jury will&para;<br>ultimately determine its worth.&para;<br>We have not extended pretrial screening for reliability&para;<br>to cases in which the suggestive circumstances were not&para;<br>arranged by law enforcement officers. Petitioner requests&para;<br>that we do so because of the grave risk that mistaken&para;<br>identification will yield a miscarriage of justice.1 Our&para;<br>decisions, however, turn on the presence of state action&para;<br>and aim to deter police from rigging identification procedures, for example, at a lineup, showup, or photograph&para;<br>array. When no improper law enforcement activity is&para;<br>involved, we hold, it suffices to test reliability through the&para;<br>rights and opportunities generally designed for that purpose, notably, the presence of counsel at postindictment&para;<br>lineups, vigorous cross-examination, protective rules of evidence, and jury instructions on both the fallibility of&para;<br>eyewitness identification and the requirement that guilt&para;<br>be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.&para;<br>I&para;<br>A&para;<br>Around 3 a.m. on August 15, 2008, Joffre Ullon called&para;<br>the Nashua, New Hampshire, Police Department and&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 The dissent, too, appears to urge that all suggestive circumstances&para;<br>raise due process concerns warranting a pretrial ruling. See post, at 6,&para;<br>9, 14–17. Neither Perry nor the dissent, however, points to a single&para;<br>case in which we have required pretrial screening absent a policearranged identification procedure. Understandably so, for there are no&para;<br>such cases. Instead, the dissent surveys our decisions, heedless of the&para;<br>police arrangement that underlies every one of them, and inventing a&para;<br>“longstanding rule,” post, at 6, that never existed. Nor are we, as the&para;<br>dissent suggests, imposing a mens rea requirement, post, at 1, 7, or&para;<br>otherwise altering our precedent in any way. As our case law makes&para;<br>clear, what triggers due process concerns is police use of an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure, whether or not they intended&para;<br>the arranged procedure to be suggestive.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>reported that an African-American male was trying to&para;<br>break into cars parked in the lot of Ullon’s apartment&para;<br>building. Officer Nicole Clay responded to the call. Upon&para;<br>arriving at the parking lot, Clay heard what “sounded like&para;<br>a metal bat hitting the ground.” App. 37a–38a. She then&para;<br>saw petitioner Barion Perry standing between two cars.&para;<br>Perry walked toward Clay, holding two car-stereo amplifiers in his hands. A metal bat lay on the ground behind&para;<br>him. Clay asked Perry where the amplifiers came from.&para;<br>“[I] found them on the ground,” Perry responded. Id.,&para;<br>at 39a.&para;<br>Meanwhile, Ullon’s wife, Nubia Blandon, woke her&para;<br>neighbor, Alex Clavijo, and told him she had just seen&para;<br>someone break into his car. Clavijo immediately went&para;<br>downstairs to the parking lot to inspect the car. He first&para;<br>observed that one of the rear windows had been shattered.&para;<br>On further inspection, he discovered that the speakers&para;<br>and amplifiers from his car stereo were missing, as were&para;<br>his bat and wrench. Clavijo then approached Clay and&para;<br>told her about Blandon’s alert and his own subsequent&para;<br>observations.&para;<br>By this time, another officer had arrived at the scene.&para;<br>Clay asked Perry to stay in the parking lot with that&para;<br>officer, while she and Clavijo went to talk to Blandon.&para;<br>Clay and Clavijo then entered the apartment building&para;<br>and took the stairs to the fourth floor, where Blandon’s and&para;<br>Clavijo’s apartments were located. They met Blandon in&para;<br>the hallway just outside the open door to her apartment.&para;<br>Asked to describe what she had seen, Blandon stated&para;<br>that, around 2:30 a.m., she saw from her kitchen window a&para;<br>tall, African-American man roaming the parking lot and&para;<br>looking into cars. Eventually, the man circled Clavijo’s&para;<br>car, opened the trunk, and removed a large box.2&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 The box, which Clay found on the ground near where she first encountered Perry, contained car-stereo speakers.

Blandon pointed to her kitchen window and said the&para;<br>person she saw breaking into Clavijo’s car was standing in&para;<br>the parking lot, next to the police officer. Perry’s arrest&para;<br>followed this identification.&para;<br>About a month later, the police showed Blandon a photographic array that included a picture of Perry and asked&para;<br>her to point out the man who had broken into Clavijo’s car.&para;<br>Blandon was unable to identify Perry.&para;<br>B&para;<br>Perry was charged in New Hampshire state court with&para;<br>one count of theft by unauthorized taking and one count of&para;<br>criminal mischief.3 Before trial, he moved to suppress&para;<br>Blandon’s identification on the ground that admitting it at&para;<br>trial would violate due process. Blandon witnessed what&para;<br>amounted to a one-person showup in the parking lot,&para;<br>Perry asserted, which all but guaranteed that she would&para;<br>identify him as the culprit. Id., at 15a–16a.&para;<br>The New Hampshire Superior Court denied the motion.&para;<br>Id., at 82a–88a. To determine whether due process prohibits the introduction of an out-of-court identification at&para;<br>trial, the Superior Court said, this Court’s decisions instruct a two-step inquiry. First, the trial court must decide whether the police used an unnecessarily suggestive&para;<br>identification procedure. Id., at 85a.

Blandon pointed to Perry “spontaneously,” the&para;<br>court noted, “without any inducement from the police.”&para;<br>Id., at 85a–86a. Clay did not ask Blandon whether the&para;<br>man standing in the parking lot was the man Blandon had&para;<br>seen breaking into Clavijo’s car. Ibid. Nor did Clay ask&para;<br>Blandon to move to the window from which she had observed the break-in. Id., at 86a.&para;<br>The Superior Court recognized that there were reasons&para;<br>to question the accuracy of Blandon’s identification: the&para;<br>parking lot was dark in some locations; Perry was standing next to a police officer; Perry was the only AfricanAmerican man in the vicinity; and Blandon was unable,&para;<br>later, to pick Perry out of a photographic array. Id., at&para;<br>86a–87a. But “[b]ecause the police procedures were not&para;<br>unnecessarily suggestive,” the court ruled that the reliability of Blandon’s testimony was for the jury to consider.&para;<br>Id., at 87a.&para;<br>At the ensuing trial, Blandon and Clay testified to&para;<br>Blandon’s out-of-court identification. The jury found Perry&para;<br>guilty of theft and not guilty of criminal mischief.&para;<br>On appeal, Perry repeated his challenge to the admissibility of Blandon’s out-of-court identification. The trial&para;<br>court erred, Perry contended, in requiring an initial showing that the police arranged the suggestive identification&para;<br>procedure. Suggestive circumstances alone, Perry argued,&para;<br>suffice to trigger the court’s duty to evaluate the reliability&para;<br>of the resulting identification before allowing presentation&para;<br>of the evidence to the jury.&para;<br>The New Hampshire Supreme Court rejected Perry’s&para;<br>argument and affirmed his conviction. Id., at 9a–11a.&para;<br>Only where the police employ suggestive identification&para;<br>techniques, that court held, does the Due Process Clause&para;<br>require a trial court to assess the reliability of identification evidence before permitting a jury to consider it.

See Kansas v. Ventris, 556 U. S. 586, 594, n. (2009)&para;<br>(“Our legal system . . . is built on the premise that it is the&para;<br>province of the jury to weigh the credibility of competing&para;<br>witnesses.”). Only when evidence “is so extremely unfair&para;<br>that its admission violates fundamental conceptions of&para;<br>justice,” Dowling v. United States, 493 U. S. 342, 352&para;<br>(1990) (internal quotation marks omitted), have we imposed a constraint tied to the Due Process Clause. See,&para;<br>e.g., Napue v. Illinois, 360 U. S. 264, 269 (1959) (Due&para;<br>process prohibits the State’s “knowin[g] use [of] false&para;<br>evidence,” because such use violates “any concept of ordered liberty.”).&para;<br>Contending that the Due Process Clause is implicated&para;<br>here, Perry relies on a series of decisions involving policearranged identification procedures. In Stovall v. Denno,&para;<br>388 U. S. 293 (1967), first of those decisions, a witness&para;<br>identified the defendant as her assailant after police officers brought the defendant to the witness’ hospital room.&para;<br>Id., at 295. At the time the witness made the identification, the defendant—the only African-American in the&para;<br>room—was handcuffed and surrounded by police officers.&para;<br>Ibid. Although the police-arranged showup was undeniably suggestive, the Court held that no due process violation occurred. Id., at 302. Crucial to the Court’s decision&para;<br>was the procedure’s necessity: The witness was the only&para;<br>person who could identify or exonerate the defendant; the&para;<br>witness could not leave her hospital room; and it was&para;<br>uncertain whether she would live to identify the defendant&para;<br>in more neutral circumstances. Ibid.&para;<br>A year later, in Simmons v. United States, 390 U. S. 377&para;<br>(1968), the Court addressed a due process challenge to&para;<br>police use of a photographic array. When a witness identi-&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>fies the defendant in a police-organized photo lineup, the&para;<br>Court ruled, the identification should be suppressed only&para;<br>where “the photographic identification procedure was so&para;<br>[unnecessarily] suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.” Id., at&para;<br>384–385. Satisfied that the photo array used by Federal&para;<br>Bureau of Investigation agents in Simmons was both&para;<br>necessary and unlikely to have led to a mistaken identification, the Court rejected the defendant’s due process&para;<br>challenge to admission of the identification. Id., at 385–&para;<br>386. In contrast, the Court held in Foster v. California,&para;<br>394 U. S. 440 (1969), that due process required the exclusion of an eyewitness identification obtained through&para;<br>police-arranged procedures that “made it all but inevitable&para;<br>that [the witness] would identify [the defendant].” Id., at&para;<br>443.&para;<br>Synthesizing previous decisions, we set forth in Neil v.&para;<br>Biggers, 409 U. S. 188 (1972), and reiterated in Manson v.&para;<br>Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98 (1977), the approach appropriately used to determine whether the Due Process Clause&para;<br>requires suppression of an eyewitness identification tainted by police arrangement. The Court emphasized, first,&para;<br>that due process concerns arise only when law enforcement officers use an identification procedure that is both&para;<br>suggestive and unnecessary. Id., at 107, 109; Biggers, 409&para;<br>U. S., at 198.

Notwithstanding the&para;<br>improper procedure, the victim’s identification was reliable: She saw her assailant for a considerable period of time&para;<br>under adequate light, provided police with a detailed description of her attacker long before the showup, and&para;<br>had “no doubt” that the defendant was the person she had&para;<br>seen.

He contends,&para;<br>however, that it was mere happenstance that each of&para;<br>the Stovall cases involved improper police action. The&para;<br>rationale underlying our decisions, Perry asserts, supports&para;<br>a rule requiring trial judges to prescreen eyewitness evidence for reliability any time an identification is made&para;<br>under suggestive circumstances.

The due process check for reliability,&para;<br>Brathwaite made plain, comes into play only after the&para;<br>defendant establishes improper police conduct. The very&para;<br>purpose of the check, the Court noted, was to avoid depriving the jury of identification evidence that is reliable,&para;<br>notwithstanding improper police conduct. 432 U.

Both ignore a key&para;<br>premise of the Brathwaite decision: A primary aim of excluding identification evidence obtained under unnecessarily suggestive circumstances, the Court said, is to deter&para;<br>law enforcement use of improper lineups, showups, and&para;<br>photo arrays in the first place.

The defendants in Coleman contended that a&para;<br>witness’ in-court identifications violated due process,&para;<br>because a pretrial stationhouse lineup was “so unduly&para;<br>prejudicial and conducive to irreparable misidentification&para;<br>as fatally to taint [the later identifications].” 399 U.

J., dissenting), 28, n. 2 (Stewart,&para;<br>J., dissenting). No due process violation occurred, the&para;<br>plurality explained, because nothing “the police said or did&para;<br>prompted [the witness’] virtually spontaneous identification of [the defendants].” Id., at 6. True, Coleman was the&para;<br>only person in the lineup wearing a hat, the plurality&para;<br>noted, but “nothing in the record show[ed] that he was&para;<br>required to do so.” Ibid. See also Colorado v. Connelly,&para;<br>479 U.

To illustrate the improper suggestion it&para;<br>was concerned about, the Court pointed to police-designed&para;<br>lineups where “all in the lineup but the suspect were&para;<br>known to the identifying witness, . . . the other participants in [the] lineup were grossly dissimilar in appearance&para;<br>to the suspect, . . . only the suspect was required to wear&para;<br>distinctive clothing which the culprit allegedly wore, . . .&para;<br>the witness is told by the police that they have caught the&para;<br>culprit after which the defendant is brought before the&para;<br>witness alone or is viewed in jail, . . . the suspect is pointed out before or during a lineup, . . . the participants in the&para;<br>lineup are asked to try on an article of clothing which fits&para;<br>only the suspect.” Id., at 233 (footnotes omitted). Beyond&para;<br>genuine debate, then, prevention of unfair police practices&para;<br>prompted the Court to extend a defendant’s right to counsel to cover postindictment lineups and showups. Id., at&para;<br>235.&para;<br>Perry’s argument, reiterated by the dissent, thus lacks&para;<br>support in the case law he cites. Moreover, his position&para;<br>would open the door to judicial preview, under the banner&para;<br>of due process, of most, if not all, eyewitness identifications. External suggestion is hardly the only factor that&para;<br>casts doubt on the trustworthiness of an eyewitness’ testimony. As one of Perry’s amici points out, many other&para;<br>factors bear on “the likelihood of misidentification,” post,&para;<br>at 9—for example, the passage of time between exposure&para;<br>to and identification of the defendant, whether the witness&para;<br>was under stress when he first encountered the suspect,&para;<br>how much time the witness had to observe the suspect,&para;<br>how far the witness was from the suspect, whether the&para;<br>suspect carried a weapon, and the race of the suspect and&para;<br>the witness.

To embrace&para;<br>Perry’s view would thus entail a vast enlargement of the&para;<br>reach of due process as a constraint on the admission of&para;<br>evidence.&para;<br>Perry maintains that the Court can limit the due process check he proposes to identifications made under&para;<br>“suggestive circumstances.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 11–14. Even&para;<br>if we could rationally distinguish suggestiveness from&para;<br>other factors bearing on the reliability of eyewitness evidence, Perry’s limitation would still involve trial courts,&para;<br>routinely, in preliminary examinations. Most eyewitness&para;<br>identifications involve some element of suggestion. Indeed, all in-court identifications do. Out-of-court identifications volunteered by witnesses are also likely to involve&para;<br>suggestive circumstances. For example, suppose a witness&para;<br>identifies the defendant to police officers after seeing a&para;<br>photograph of the defendant in the press captioned “theft&para;<br>suspect,” or hearing a radio report implicating the defendant in the crime. Or suppose the witness knew that the&para;<br>defendant ran with the wrong crowd and saw him on the&para;<br>day and in the vicinity of the crime. Any of these circumstances might have “suggested” to the witness that the&para;<br>defendant was the person the witness observed committing the crime.&para;<br>C&para;<br>In urging a broadly applicable due process check on&para;<br>eyewitness identifications, Perry maintains that eyewitness identifications are a uniquely unreliable form of&para;<br>evidence.

S., at 228.&para;<br>We have concluded in other contexts, however, that the&para;<br>potential unreliability of a type of evidence does not alone&para;<br>render its introduction at the defendant’s trial fundamentally unfair.

S., at 353 (rejecting argument that the introduction of evidence concerning&para;<br>acquitted conduct is fundamentally unfair because such&para;<br>evidence is “inherently unreliable”). We reach a similar&para;<br>conclusion here: The fallibility of eyewitness evidence does&para;<br>not, without the taint of improper state conduct, warrant a&para;<br>due process rule requiring a trial court to screen such&para;<br>evidence for reliability before allowing the jury to assess&para;<br>its creditworthiness.&para;<br>Our unwillingness to enlarge the domain of due process&para;<br>as Perry and the dissent urge rests, in large part, on our&para;<br>recognition that the jury, not the judge, traditionally determines the reliability of evidence. See supra, at 7. We&para;<br>also take account of other safeguards built into our adversary system that caution juries against placing undue&para;<br>weight on eyewitness testimony of questionable reliability.&para;<br>These protections include the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to confront the eyewitness. See Maryland v.&para;<br>Craig, 497 U.

The&para;<br>Court’s holding enshrines a murky distinction—between&para;<br>suggestive confrontations intentionally orchestrated by&para;<br>the police and, as here, those inadvertently caused by&para;<br>police actions—that will sow confusion.

Brathwaite, 432 U. S. 98,&para;<br>111–112 (1977). We have pointed to the “ ‘formidable’ ”&para;<br>number of “miscarriage[s] of justice from mistaken identification” in the annals of criminal law. Wade, 388 U. S., at&para;<br>228. We have warned of the “vagaries” and “ ‘proverbially untrustworthy’ ” nature of eyewitness identifications.&para;<br>Ibid. And we have singled out a “major factor contributing” to that proverbial unreliability: “the suggestibility&para;<br>inherent in the context of the pretrial identification.” Id.,&para;<br>at 228, 235.&para;<br>Our precedents make no distinction between intentional&para;<br>and unintentional suggestion. To the contrary, they explicitly state that “[s]uggestion can be created intentionally or unintentionally in many subtle ways.” Id., at 229.&para;<br>Rather than equate suggestive conduct with misconduct,&para;<br>we specifically have disavowed the assumption that suggestive influences may only be “the result of police procedures intentionally designed to prejudice an accused.” Id.,&para;<br>at 235; see also id., at 236 (noting “grave potential for&para;<br>prejudice, intentional or not, in the pretrial lineup”); id., at&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Because the facts of this case involve police action, I do not reach the&para;<br>question whether due process is triggered in situations involving no&para;<br>police action whatsoever.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

Illinois, 434&para;<br>U. S. 220, 224 (1977). The implication is that even police&para;<br>acting with the best of intentions can inadvertently signal&para;<br>“ ‘that’s the man.’ ” Wade, 388 U.

[i]n the present case.” 388 U. S., at&para;<br>233–234. We then highlighted not the lineup procedure,&para;<br>but rather a preprocedure encounter: The two witnesses&para;<br>who later identified Wade in the lineup had seen Wade&para;<br>outside while “await[ing] assembly of the lineup.” Id., at&para;<br>234. Wade had been standing in the hallway, which happened to be “observable to the witnesses through an open&para;<br>door.” Ibid. One witness saw Wade “within sight of&para;<br>an FBI agent”; the other saw him “in the custody of the&para;<br>agent.” Ibid. In underscoring the hazards of these circumstances, we made no mention of whether the encounter had been arranged; indeed, the facts suggest that it&para;<br>was not.&para;<br>More generally, our precedents focus not on the act of&para;<br>suggestion, but on suggestion’s “corrupting effect” on&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Wade held that the dangers of pretrial identification procedures&para;<br>necessitated a right to counsel; that same day, Stovall held that a&para;<br>defendant ineligible for the Wade rule was still entitled to challenge the&para;<br>confrontation as a due process violation. Because the two were companion cases advancing interrelated rules to avoid unfairness at trial&para;<br>resulting from suggestive pretrial confrontations, Wade’s exposition of&para;<br>the dangers of suggestiveness informs both contexts. See Manson v.&para;<br>Brathwaite, 432 U.

Eyewitness&para;<br>evidence derived from suggestive circumstances, we have&para;<br>explained, is uniquely resistant to the ordinary tests of the&para;<br>adversary process. An eyewitness who has made an identification often becomes convinced of its accuracy. “Regardless of how the initial misidentification comes about,&para;<br>the witness thereafter is apt to retain in his memory the&para;<br>image of the photograph rather than of the person actually&para;<br>seen, reducing the trustworthiness of subsequent . . .&para;<br>courtroom identification.” Simmons v. United States, 390&para;<br>U. S. 377, 383–384 (1968) (emphasis added); see also&para;<br>Wade, 388 U. S., at 229 (witness is “not likely” to recant).&para;<br>Suggestion bolsters that confidence.&para;<br>At trial, an eyewitness’ artificially inflated confidence in&para;<br>an identification’s accuracy complicates the jury’s task of&para;<br>assessing witness credibility and reliability. It also impairs the defendant’s ability to attack the eyewitness’&para;<br>credibility. Stovall, 388 U. S., at 298. That in turn jeopardizes the defendant’s basic right to subject his accuser&para;<br>to meaningful cross-examination. See Wade, 388 U. S.,&para;<br>at 235 (“[C]ross-examination . . . cannot be viewed as an&para;<br>absolute assurance of accuracy and reliability . . . where so&para;<br>many variables and pitfalls exist”). The end result of&para;<br>suggestion, whether intentional or unintentional, is to&para;<br>fortify testimony bearing directly on guilt that juries find&para;<br>extremely convincing and are hesitant to discredit. See&para;<br>id., at 224 (“[A]t pretrial proceedings . . . the results might&para;<br>well settle the accused’s fate and reduce the trial itself to a&para;<br>mere formality”); Gilbert, 388 U. S., at 273 (“[T]he witness’&para;<br>testimony of his lineup identification will enhance the&para;<br>impact of his in-court identification on the jury”).&para;<br>Consistent with our focus on reliability, we have declined to adopt a per se rule excluding all suggestive identifications. Instead, “reliability is the linchpin” in deciding&para;<br>admissibility. Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 114. We have&para;<br>explained that a suggestive identification procedure “does&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>not in itself intrude upon a constitutionally protected interest.” Id., at 113, n. 13; see also Neil v. Biggers, 409&para;<br>U. S. 188, 198–199 (1972) (rejecting the proposition that&para;<br>“unnecessary suggestiveness alone requires the exclusion&para;<br>of evidence”). “Suggestive confrontations are disapproved&para;<br>because they increase the likelihood of misidentification”—and “[i]t is the likelihood of misidentification which&para;<br>violates a defendant’s right to due process.” Id., at 198;&para;<br>see also United States ex rel. Kirby v. Sturges, 510 F. 2d&para;<br>397, 406 (CA7 1975) (Stevens, J.) (“The due process clause&para;<br>applies only to proceedings which result in a deprivation of&para;<br>life, liberty or property. . . . [I]f a constitutional violation&para;<br>results from a showup, it occurs in the courtroom, not in&para;<br>the police station”). In short, “ ‘what the Stovall due process right protects is an evidentiary interest.’ ” Brathwaite,&para;<br>432 U. S., at 113, n. 14.&para;<br>To protect that evidentiary interest, we have applied a&para;<br>two-step inquiry: First, the defendant has the burden of&para;<br>showing that the eyewitness identification was derived&para;<br>through “impermissibly suggestive” means.3 Simmons,&para;<br>390 U. S., at 384. Second, if the defendant meets that&para;<br>burden, courts consider whether the identification was&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Our precedents refer to “impermissibly,” “unnecessarily,” and “unduly” suggestive circumstances interchangeably. See, e.g., Brathwaite,&para;<br>432 U. S., at 105, n. 8, 107–108, 110, 112–113 (“impermissibly” and&para;<br>“unnecessarily”); Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 196–199 (1972) (“impermissibly” and “unnecessarily”); Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U. S. 1, 3–&para;<br>5 (1970) (“unduly” and “impermissibly”); Simmons v. United States, 390&para;<br>U. S. 377, 383–384 (1968) (“unduly” and “impermissibly”). The Circuits&para;<br>have followed suit. E.g., Thigpen v. Cory, 804 F. 2d 893, 895 (CA6&para;<br>1986) (“unduly”); Green v. Loggins, 614 F. 2d 219, 223 (CA9 1980)&para;<br>(“unnecessarily or impermissibly”). All reinforce our focus not on the&para;<br>act of suggestion, but on whether the suggestiveness rises to such a&para;<br>level that it undermines reliability. Police machinations can heighten&para;<br>the likelihood of misidentification, but they are no prerequisite to&para;<br>finding a confrontation “so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a&para;<br>very substantial likelihood of . . . misidentification.” Simmons, 390&para;<br>U.

That step&para;<br>entails considering the witness’ opportunity to view the&para;<br>perpetrator, degree of attention, accuracy of description,&para;<br>level of certainty, and the time between the crime and&para;<br>pretrial confrontation, then weighing such factors against&para;<br>the “corrupting effect of the suggestive identification.”&para;<br>Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 108, 114. Most identifications&para;<br>will be admissible. The standard of “fairness as required&para;<br>by the Due Process Clause,” id., at 113, however, demands&para;<br>that a subset of the most unreliable identifications—those&para;<br>carrying a “ ‘very substantial likelihood of . . . misidentification’ ”—will be excluded. Biggers, 409 U. S., at 198.&para;<br>II&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>The majority today creates a novel and significant limitation on our longstanding rule: Eyewitness identifications&para;<br>so impermissibly suggestive that they pose a very substantial likelihood of an unreliable identification will be&para;<br>deemed inadmissible at trial only if the suggestive circumstances were “police-arranged.” Ante, at 2. Absent “improper police arrangement,” “improper police conduct,” or&para;<br>“rigging,” the majority holds, our two-step inquiry does not&para;<br>even “com[e] into play.” Ante, at 2, 11. I cannot agree.&para;<br>The majority does not simply hold that an eyewitness&para;<br>identification must be the product of police action to trigger our ordinary two-step inquiry. Rather, the majority&para;<br>maintains that the suggestive circumstances giving rise&para;<br>to the identification must be “police-arranged,” “police&para;<br>rigg[ed],” “police-designed,” or “police-organized.” Ante, at&para;<br>2, 12–13. Those terms connote a degree of intentional&para;<br>orchestration or manipulation. See Brief for Respondent&para;<br>19 (no indication that police “deliberately tried to manipulate any evidence”); Brief for United States as Amicus&para;<br>Curiae 18 (“[N]o one deliberately arranged the circumstances to obtain an identification”). The majority cate-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>gorically exempts all eyewitness identifications derived&para;<br>from suggestive circumstances that were not policemanipulated—however suggestive, and however unreliable—from our due process check. The majority thus&para;<br>appears to graft a mens rea requirement onto our existing&para;<br>rule.4&para;<br>As this case illustrates, police intent is now paramount.&para;<br>As the Court acknowledges, Perry alleges an “accidental&para;<br>showup.” Brief for Petitioner 34 (emphasis added); see&para;<br>ante, at 4. He was the only African-American at the scene&para;<br>of the crime standing next to a police officer. For the&para;<br>majority, the fact that the police did not intend that&para;<br>showup, even if they inadvertently caused it in the course&para;<br>of a police procedure, ends the inquiry. The police were&para;<br>questioning the eyewitness, Blandon, about the perpetrator’s identity, and were intentionally detaining Perry in&para;<br>the parking lot—but had not intended for Blandon to&para;<br>identify the perpetrator from her window. Presumably, in&para;<br>the majority’s view, had the police asked Blandon to move&para;<br>to the window to identify the perpetrator, that could have&para;<br>made all the difference. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32, 37.&para;<br>I note, however, that the majority leaves what is required by its arrangement-focused inquiry less than clear.&para;<br>In parts, the opinion suggests that the police must arrange&para;<br>an identification “procedure,” regardless of whether they&para;<br>“inten[d] the arranged procedure to be suggestive.” Ante,&para;<br>at 2, n. 1; see also ante, at 7–8. Elsewhere, it indicates&para;<br>that the police must arrange the “suggestive circumstances” that lead the witness to identify the accused. See&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 The majority denies that it has imposed a mens rea requirement, see&para;<br>ante, at 2, n. 1, but by confining our due process concerns to policearranged identification procedures, that is just what it has done. The&para;<br>majority acknowledges that “whether or not [the police] intended the&para;<br>arranged procedure to be suggestive” is irrelevant under our precedents, ibid., but still places dispositive weight on whether or not the&para;<br>police intended the procedure itself.&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>ante, at 1–2, 10–11, 18–19. Still elsewhere it refers to “improper” police conduct, ante, at 1–2, 9–12, connoting bad&para;<br>faith. Does police “arrangement” relate to the procedure, the&para;<br>suggestiveness, or both? If it relates to the procedure, do&para;<br>suggestive preprocedure encounters no longer raise the&para;<br>same concerns? If the police need not “inten[d] the arranged procedure to be suggestive,” ante, at 2, n. 1, what&para;<br>makes the police action “improper”? And does that mean&para;<br>that good-faith, unintentional police suggestiveness in a&para;<br>police-arranged lineup can be “impermissibly suggestive”? If no, the majority runs headlong into Wade. If&para;<br>yes, on what basis—if not deterrence—does it distinguish&para;<br>unintentional police suggestiveness in an accidental&para;<br>confrontation?&para;<br>The arrangement-focused inquiry will sow needless confusion. If the police had called Perry and Blandon to&para;<br>the police station for interviews, and Blandon saw Perry&para;<br>being questioned, would that be sufficiently “improper&para;<br>police arrangement”? If Perry had voluntarily come to the&para;<br>police station, would that change the result? Today’s&para;<br>opinion renders the applicability of our ordinary inquiry&para;<br>contingent on a murky line-drawing exercise. Whereas&para;<br>our two-step inquiry focuses on overall reliability—and&para;<br>could account for the spontaneity of the witness’ identification and degree of police manipulation under the totality of the circumstances—today’s opinion forecloses that&para;<br>assessment by establishing a new and inflexible step zero.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The majority regards its limitation on our two-step rule&para;<br>as compelled by precedent. Its chief rationale, ante, at 7–&para;<br>13, is that none of our prior cases involved situations&para;<br>where the police “did not arrange the suggestive circumstances.” Ante, at 10; see also ante, at 2, n. 1. That is not&para;<br>necessarily true, given the seemingly unintentional encounter highlighted in Wade. But even if it were true, it is&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>unsurprising. The vast majority of eyewitness identifications that the State uses in criminal prosecutions are&para;<br>obtained in lineup, showup, and photograph displays&para;<br>arranged by the police. Our precedents reflect that practical reality.&para;<br>It is also beside the point. Our due process concerns&para;<br>were not predicated on the source of suggestiveness.&para;<br>Rather, “[i]t is the likelihood of misidentification which&para;<br>violates a defendant’s right to due process,” Biggers, 409&para;<br>U. S., at 198, and we are concerned with suggestion insofar as it has “corrupting effect[s]” on the identification’s&para;<br>reliability. Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 114. Accordingly,&para;<br>whether the police have created the suggestive circumstances intentionally or inadvertently, the resulting identification raises the same due process concerns. It is no&para;<br>more or less likely to misidentify the perpetrator. It is&para;<br>no more or less powerful to the jury. And the defendant&para;<br>is no more or less equipped to challenge the identification through cross-examination or prejudiced at trial. The&para;<br>arrangement-focused inquiry thus untethers our doctrine&para;<br>from the very “ ‘evidentiary interest’ ” it was designed to&para;<br>protect, inviting arbitrary results. Id., at 113, n. 14.&para;<br>Indeed, it is the majority’s approach that lies in tension&para;<br>with our precedents. Whereas we previously disclaimed&para;<br>the crabbed view of suggestiveness as “the result of police procedures intentionally designed to prejudice an accused,” Wade, 388 U. S., at 235, the majority’s focus on&para;<br>police rigging and improper conduct will revive it. Whereas our precedents were sensitive to intentional and unintentional suggestiveness alike, see supra, at 2–3, today’s&para;<br>decision narrows our concern to intentionally orchestrated&para;<br>suggestive confrontations. We once described the “primary evil to be avoided” as the likelihood of misidentification.&para;<br>Biggers, 409 U. S., at 198. Today’s decision, however,&para;<br>means that even if that primary evil is at its apex, we&para;<br>need not avoid it at all so long as the suggestive circum-&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>stances do not stem from improper police arrangement.&para;<br>C&para;<br>The majority gives several additional reasons for why&para;<br>applying our due process rule beyond improperly policearranged circumstances is unwarranted. In my view, none&para;<br>withstands close inspection.&para;<br>First, the majority insists that our precedents “aim to&para;<br>deter police from rigging identification procedures,” so our&para;<br>rule should be limited to applications that advance that&para;<br>“primary aim” and “key premise.” Ante, at 2, 11 (citing&para;<br>Brathwaite, 432 U. S., at 112). That mischaracterizes our&para;<br>cases. We discussed deterrence in Brathwaite because&para;<br>Brathwaite challenged our two-step inquiry as lacking&para;<br>deterrence value. Brathwaite argued that deterrence demanded a per se rule excluding all suggestive identifications. He said that our rule, which probes the reliability of&para;<br>suggestive identifications under the totality of the circumstances, “cannot be expected to have a significant deterrent impact.” Id., at 111.&para;<br>We rebutted Brathwaite’s criticism in language the&para;<br>majority now wrenches from context: Upon summarizing&para;<br>Brathwaite’s argument, we acknowledged “several interests to be considered.” Ibid. We then compared the two&para;<br>rules under each interest: First, we noted the “driving&para;<br>force” behind Wade and its companion cases—“the concern&para;<br>that the jury not hear eyewitness testimony unless that&para;<br>evidence has aspects of reliability”—and found both approaches “responsive to this concern,” but the per se rule&para;<br>to go “too far” in suppressing reliable evidence. 432 U. S.,&para;<br>at 111–112. We noted a “second factor”—deterrence—&para;<br>conceding that the per se rule had “more significant deterrent effect,” but noting that our rule “also has an influence&para;<br>on police behavior.” Id., at 112. Finally, we noted a “third&para;<br>factor”—“the effect on the administration of justice”—&para;<br>describing the per se rule as having serious drawbacks on&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>this front. Ibid. That was no list of “primary aim[s].” Nor&para;<br>was it a ringing endorsement of the primacy of deterrence.&para;<br>We simply underscored, in responding to Brathwaite,&para;<br>that our rule was not without deterrence benefits. To&para;<br>the contrary, we clarified that deterrence was a subsidiary&para;<br>concern to reliability, the “driving force” of our doctrine. It&para;<br>is a stretch to claim that our rule cannot apply wherever&para;<br>“[t]his deterrence rationale is inapposite.” Ante, at 11.&para;<br>Second, the majority states that Coleman v. Alabama,&para;<br>399 U. S. 1 (1970), held that “[n]o due process violation&para;<br>occurred . . . because nothing ‘the police said or did&para;<br>prompted’ ” the identification and shows that our rule is&para;<br>linked “only to improper police arrangement.” Ante, at&para;<br>11–12. That misreads the decision. In Coleman, the&para;<br>petitioners challenged a witness’ in-court identification of&para;<br>them at trial on grounds that it had been tainted by a&para;<br>suggestive pretrial lineup. We held that no due process&para;<br>violation occurred because the in-court identification appeared to be “entirely based upon observations at the&para;<br>time of the assault and not at all induced by the conduct of&para;<br>the lineup,” and thus could not be said to stem from an&para;<br>identification procedure “ ‘so impermissibly suggestive as&para;<br>to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable&para;<br>misidentification.’ ” 399 U. S., at 5–6 (plurality opinion).&para;<br>We then dismissed each of the asserted suggestive influences as having had no bearing on the identification at all:&para;<br>The petitioners claimed that the police intimated to the&para;<br>witness that his attackers were in the lineup; we found the&para;<br>record “devoid of evidence that anything the police said or&para;<br>did” induced the identification. Id., at 6. The petitioners&para;<br>claimed that they alone were made to say certain words;&para;<br>we found that the witness identified petitioners before&para;<br>either said anything. One petitioner claimed he was&para;<br>singled out to wear a hat; we found that the witness’&para;<br>identification “d[id] not appear . . . based on the fact that&para;<br>he remembered that [the attacker] had worn a hat.” Ibid.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Thus, far from indicating that improper police conduct is a&para;<br>prerequisite, Coleman merely held that there had been no&para;<br>influence on the witness. In fact, in concluding that the&para;<br>lineup was not “ ‘so impermissibly suggestive as to give&para;<br>rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,’ ” Coleman indicates that the two-step inquiry is not truncated at the threshold by the absence of&para;<br>police misconduct.&para;<br>Third, the majority emphasizes that we should rely on&para;<br>the jury to determine the reliability of evidence. See ante,&para;<br>at 15–16. But our cases are rooted in the assumption that&para;<br>eyewitness identifications upend the ordinary expectation&para;<br>that it is “the province of the jury to weigh the credibility&para;<br>of competing witnesses.” Kansas v. Ventris, 556 U. S. 586,&para;<br>594, n. (2009). As noted, jurors find eyewitness evidence&para;<br>unusually powerful and their ability to assess credibility&para;<br>is hindered by a witness’ false confidence in the accuracy&para;<br>of his or her identification. That disability in no way depends on the intent behind the suggestive circumstances.&para;<br>The majority’s appeals to protecting the jury’s domain,&para;<br>moreover, appeared in dissent after dissent from our decisions. See Foster v. California, 394 U. S. 440, 447&para;<br>(1969) (Black, J., dissenting) (“[T]he jury is the sole tribunal to weigh and determine facts” and “must . . . be allowed to hear eyewitnesses and decide for itself whether it&para;<br>can recognize the truth”); Simmons, 390 U. S., at 395&para;<br>(Black, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“The&para;<br>weight of the evidence . . . is not a question for the Court&para;<br>but for the jury”). So too does the majority’s assurance&para;<br>that other constitutional protections like the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment rights to compulsory process and confrontation can suffice to expose unreliable identifications. Compare ante, at 6, with Foster, 394 U. S., at 448–449 (Black,&para;<br>J., dissenting) (“The Constitution sets up its own standards of unfairness in criminal trials,” including the Sixth&para;<br>Amendment “right to compulsory process” and “right to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>confront . . . witnesses”). So too does the majority’s appeal&para;<br>to leave reliability to the rules of evidence. Compare ante,&para;<br>at 17, with Foster, 394 U. S., at 448 (Black, J., dissenting)&para;<br>(“ ‘Rules of evidence are designed in the interests of fair&para;<br>trials’ ”), and Stovall, 388 U. S., at 306 (Black, J., dissenting) (“[T]he result . . . is to put into a constitutional mould&para;<br>a rule of evidence”). Those arguments did not prevail&para;<br>then; they should not prevail here.&para;<br>Fourth, the majority suggests that applying our rule&para;<br>beyond police-arranged suggestive circumstances would&para;<br>entail a heavy practical burden, requiring courts to engage&para;<br>in “preliminary judicial inquiry” into “most, if not all,&para;<br>eyewitness identifications.” Ante, at 13, 18. But that is&para;<br>inaccurate. The burden of showing “impermissibly suggestive” circumstances is the defendant’s, so the objection&para;<br>falls to the defendant to raise. And as is implicit in the&para;<br>majority’s reassurance that Perry may resort to the rules&para;<br>of evidence in lieu of our due process precedents, trial&para;<br>courts will be entertaining defendants’ objections, pretrial&para;<br>or at trial, to unreliable eyewitness evidence in any event.&para;<br>The relevant question, then, is what the standard of admissibility governing such objections should be. I see no&para;<br>reason to water down the standard for an equally suggestive and unreliable identification simply because the&para;<br>suggestive confrontation was unplanned.&para;<br>It bears reminding, moreover, that we set a high bar for&para;<br>suppression. The vast majority of eyewitnesses proceed to&para;<br>testify before a jury. To date, Foster is the only case in&para;<br>which we have found a due process violation. 394 U. S., at&para;<br>443. There has been no flood of claims in the four Federal&para;<br>Circuits that, having seen no basis for an arrangementbased distinction in our precedents, have long indicated&para;<br>that due process scrutiny applies to all suggestive identification procedures. See Dunnigan v. Keane, 137 F. 3d 117,&para;<br>128 (CA2 1998); United States v. Bouthot, 878 F. 2d 1506,&para;<br>1516 (CA1 1989); Thigpen v. Cory, 804 F. 2d 893, 895 (CA6&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>PERRY v. NEW HAMPSHIRE&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>1986); see also Green v. Loggins, 614 F. 2d 219, 223 (CA9&para;<br>1980). Today’s decision nonetheless precludes even the&para;<br>possibility that an unintended confrontation will meet&para;<br>that bar, mandating summary dismissal of every such&para;<br>claim at the threshold.&para;<br>Finally, the majority questions how to “rationally distinguish suggestiveness from other factors bearing on the&para;<br>reliability of eyewitness evidence,” such as “poor vision” or&para;<br>a prior “grudge,” ante, at 13–14, and more broadly, how to&para;<br>distinguish eyewitness evidence from other kinds of arguably unreliable evidence. Ante, at 14–15. Our precedents,&para;<br>however, did just that. We emphasized the “ ‘formidable&para;<br>number of instances in the records of English and American trials’ ” of “miscarriage[s] of justice from mistaken&para;<br>identification.” Wade, 388 U. S., at 228. We then observed&para;<br>that “ ‘the influence of improper suggestion upon identifying witnesses probably accounts for more miscarriages of&para;<br>justice than any other single factor.’ ” Id., at 229. Moreover, the majority points to no other type of evidence that&para;<br>shares the rare confluence of characteristics that makes&para;<br>eyewitness evidence a unique threat to the fairness of&para;<br>trial. Jailhouse informants, cf. ante, at 15, unreliable as&para;<br>they may be, are not similarly resistant to the traditional&para;<br>tools of the adversarial process and, if anything, are met&para;<br>with particular skepticism by juries.&para;<br>It would be one thing if the passage of time had cast&para;<br>doubt on the empirical premises of our precedents. But&para;<br>just the opposite has happened. A vast body of scientific&para;<br>literature has reinforced every concern our precedents&para;<br>articulated nearly a half-century ago, though it merits&para;<br>barely a parenthetical mention in the majority opinion.&para;<br>Ante, at 14. Over the past three decades, more than two&para;<br>thousand studies related to eyewitness identification have&para;<br>been published. One state supreme court recently appointed a special master to conduct an exhaustive survey&para;<br>of the current state of the scientific evidence and conclud-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 565 U.

Henderson, 208&para;<br>N. J. 208, 283, 27 A. 3d 872, 916 (2011). “Experimental&para;<br>methods and findings have been tested and retested,&para;<br>subjected to scientific scrutiny through peer-reviewed&para;<br>journals, evaluated through the lens of meta-analyses, and&para;<br>replicated at times in real-world settings.” Ibid.; see also&para;<br>Schmechel, O’Toole, Easterly, &amp; Loftus, Beyond the Ken?&para;<br>Testing Jurors’ Understanding of Eyewitness Reliability&para;<br>Evidence, 46 Jurimetrics 177, 180 (2006) (noting “nearly&para;<br>unanimous consensus among researchers about the [eyewitness reliability] field’s core findings”).&para;<br>The empirical evidence demonstrates that eyewitness&para;<br>misidentification is “ ‘the single greatest cause of wrongful&para;<br>convictions in this country.’ ”5 Researchers have found&para;<br>that a staggering 76% of the first 250 convictions overturned due to DNA evidence since 1989 involved eyewitness misidentification.6 Study after study demonstrates&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 State v.
