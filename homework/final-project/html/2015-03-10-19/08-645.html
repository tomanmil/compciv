ABBOTT&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE FIFTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 08–645.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued January 12, 2010—Decided May 17, 2010&para;<br>&para;<br>After the Abbotts, a married couple, moved to Chile and separated, the&para;<br>Chilean courts granted respondent wife daily care and control of their&para;<br>minor son, A. J. A., while awarding petitioner husband visitation&para;<br>rights. Mr. Abbott also had a ne exeat right to consent before Ms. Ab&para;<br>bott could take A. J. A. out of the country under Chile Minors Law&para;<br>16,618 (Minors Law 16,618), art. 49. When Ms. Abbott brought&para;<br>A. J. A. to Texas without permission from Mr. Abbott or the Chilean&para;<br>family court, Mr. Abbott filed this suit in the Federal District Court,&para;<br>seeking an order requiring his son’s return to Chile under the Hague&para;<br>Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction&para;<br>(Convention) and the implementing statute, the International Child&para;<br>Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 42 U. S. C. §11601 et seq. Among&para;<br>its provisions, the Convention seeks “to secure the prompt return of&para;<br>children wrongfully removed or retained in any Contracting State,”&para;<br>Art. 1; provides that such “removal or retention . . . is to be consid&para;<br>ered wrongful where” “it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to&para;<br>a person . . . under the law of the State in which the child was [there&para;<br>tofore] habitually resident,” Art. 3(a), and where “those rights [had&para;<br>been] actually exercised . . . or would have been so exercised but for&para;<br>the removal or retention,” Art. 3(b); and defines “rights of custody” to&para;<br>“include . . . the right to determine the child’s place of residence,” Art.&para;<br>5(a). The District Court denied relief, holding that the father’s ne&para;<br>exeat right did not constitute a “righ[t] of custody” under the Conven&para;<br>tion and, thus, that the return remedy was not authorized. The Fifth&para;<br>Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>Held: A parent has a right of custody under the Convention by reason of&para;<br>that parent’s ne exeat right. Pp. 4–17.&para;<br>(a) The Convention applies because A. J. A. is under 16; he was a&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. ABBOTT&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>habitual resident of Chile; and both Chile and the United States are&para;<br>contracting states. The ICARA instructs the state or federal court in&para;<br>which a petition alleging international child abduction has been filed&para;<br>to “decide the case in accordance with the Convention.” §§11603(b),&para;<br>(d). P. 5.&para;<br>(b) That A. J. A. was wrongfully removed from Chile in violation of&para;<br>a “righ[t] of custody” is shown by the Convention’s text, by the U. S.&para;<br>State Department’s views, by contracting states’ court decisions, and&para;<br>by the Convention’s purposes. Pp. 5–18.&para;<br>(1) Chilean law determines the content of Mr. Abbott’s right,&para;<br>while the Convention’s text and structure resolve whether that right&para;<br>is a “righ[t] of custody.” Minors Law 16,618, art. 49, provides that&para;<br>“[o]nce the court has decreed” that one of the parents has visitation&para;<br>rights, that parent’s “authorization” generally “shall also be required”&para;<br>before the child may be taken out of the country. Because Mr. Abbott&para;<br>has direct and regular visitation rights, it follows that he has a&para;<br>ne exeat right under article 49. The Convention recognizes that cus&para;<br>tody rights can be decreed jointly or alone, see Art. 3(a), and Mr. Ab&para;<br>bott’s ne exeat right is best classified as a “joint right of custody,”&para;<br>which the Convention defines to “include rights relating to the care of&para;<br>the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the&para;<br>child’s place of residence,” Art. 5(a). Mr. Abbott’s right to decide&para;<br>A. J. A.’s country of residence allows him to “determine the child’s&para;<br>place of residence,” especially given the Convention’s purpose to pre&para;<br>vent wrongful removal across international borders. It also gives him&para;<br>“rights relating to the care of the person of the child,” in that choos&para;<br>ing A. J. A.’s residence country can determine the shape of his early&para;<br>and adolescent years and his language, identity, and culture and tra&para;<br>ditions. That a ne exeat right does not fit within traditional physical&para;<br>custody notions is beside the point because the Convention’s defini&para;<br>tion of “rights of custody” controls. This uniform, text-based ap&para;<br>proach ensures international consistency in interpreting the Conven&para;<br>tion, foreclosing courts from relying on local usage to undermine&para;<br>recognition of custodial arrangements in other countries and under&para;<br>other legal traditions. In any case, this country has adopted modern&para;<br>conceptions of custody e.g., joint legal custody, that accord with the&para;<br>Convention’s broad definition. Ms. Abbott mistakenly claims that a&para;<br>ne exeat right cannot qualify as a right of custody because the Con&para;<br>vention requires that any such right be capable of “exercis[e].” When&para;<br>one parent removes a child without seeking the ne exeat holder’s con&para;<br>sent, it is an instance where the right would have been “exercised but&para;<br>for the removal or retention,” Art. 3(b). The Fifth Circuit’s conclusion&para;<br>that a breach of a ne exeat right does not give rise to a return remedy&para;<br>would render the Convention meaningless in many cases where it is&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>most needed. Any suggestion that a ne exeat right is a right of access&para;<br>is atexual, as a ne exeat right is not even arguably a “right to take a&para;<br>child for a limited period of time.” Art. 5(b). Ms. Abbott’s argument&para;<br>that the ne exeat order in this case cannot create a right of custody is&para;<br>not dispositive because Mr. Abbott asserts rights under Minors Law&para;<br>16,618, which do not derive from the order. Pp. 6–11.&para;<br>(2) This Court’s conclusion is strongly supported and informed by&para;<br>the longstanding view of the State Department’s Office of Children’s&para;<br>Issues, this country’s Convention enforcement entity, that ne exeat&para;<br>rights are rights of custody. The Court owes deference to the Execu&para;<br>tive Branch’s treaty interpretations. See Sumitomo Shoji America,&para;<br>Inc. v. Avagliano, 457 U. S. 176, 185. There is no reason to doubt this&para;<br>well-established canon here. The Executive, when dealing with deli&para;<br>cate foreign relations matters like international child abductions,&para;<br>possesses a great store of information on practical realities such as&para;<br>the reactions from treaty partners to a particular treaty interpreta&para;<br>tion and the impact that interpretation may have on the State De&para;<br>partment’s ability to reclaim children abducted from this country.&para;<br>Pp. 11–12.&para;<br>(3) The Court’s view is also substantially informed by the views&para;<br>of sister contracting states on the issue, see El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd.&para;<br>v. Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U. S. 155, 176, particularly because the&para;<br>ICARA directs that “uniform international interpretation” of the&para;<br>Convention is part of its framework, see §11601(b)(3)(B). While the&para;<br>Supreme Court of Canada has reached an arguably contrary view,&para;<br>and French courts are divided, a review of the international law con&para;<br>firms that courts and other legal authorities in England, Israel, Aus&para;<br>tria, South Africa, Germany, Australia, and Scotland have accepted&para;<br>the rule that ne exeat rights are rights of custody within the Conven&para;<br>tion’s meaning. Scholars agree that there is an emerging interna&para;<br>tional consensus on the matter. And the Convention’s history is fully&para;<br>consistent with the conclusion that ne exeat rights are just one of the&para;<br>many ways in which custody of children can be exercised. Pp. 12–16.&para;<br>(4) The Court’s holding also accords with the Convention’s objects&para;<br>and purposes. There is no reason to doubt the ability of other con&para;<br>tracting states to carry out their duty to make decisions in the best&para;<br>interests of the children. To interpret the Convention to permit an&para;<br>abducting parent to avoid a return remedy, even when the other par&para;<br>ent holds a ne exeat right, runs counter to the Convention’s purpose of&para;<br>deterring child abductions to a country that provides a friendlier fo&para;<br>rum. Denying such a remedy would legitimize the very action, re&para;<br>moval of the child, that the Convention was designed to prevent,&para;<br>while requiring return of the child in cases like this one helps deter&para;<br>abductions and respects the Convention’s purpose to prevent harms&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. ABBOTT&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>to the child resulting from abductions. Pp. 16–18.&para;<br>(c) While a parent possessing a ne exeat right has a right of custody&para;<br>and may seek a return remedy, return will not automatically be or&para;<br>dered if the abducting parent can establish the applicability of a Con&para;<br>vention exception, such as “a grave risk that . . . return would expose&para;<br>the child to . . . harm or [an] otherwise . . . intolerable situation,” or&para;<br>the objection to removal by a child who has reached a sufficient “age&para;<br>and degree of maturity” to state a preference, Art. 13(b). The proper&para;<br>interpretation and application of exceptions may be addressed on re&para;<br>mand.

I. A. S. No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99–11. The&para;<br>United States is a contracting state to the Convention; and&para;<br>Congress has implemented its provisions through the&para;<br>International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 102&para;<br>Stat. 437, 42 U. S. C. §11601 et seq. The Convention&para;<br>provides that a child abducted in violation of “rights of&para;<br>custody” must be returned to the child’s country of habit­&para;<br>ual residence, unless certain exceptions apply. Art. 1, S.&para;<br>Treaty Doc. No. 99–11, at 7 (Treaty Doc.). The question is&para;<br>whether a parent has a “righ[t] of custody” by reason of&para;<br>that parent’s ne exeat right: the authority to consent before&para;<br>the other parent may take the child to another country.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Timothy Abbott and Jacquelyn Vaye Abbott married in&para;<br>England in 1992. He is a British citizen, and she is a&para;<br>citizen of the United States. Mr. Abbott’s astronomy&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. ABBOTT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>profession took the couple to Hawaii, where their son&para;<br>A. J. A. was born in 1995. The Abbotts moved to La&para;<br>Serena, Chile, in 2002. There was marital discord, and&para;<br>the parents separated in March 2003. The Chilean courts&para;<br>granted the mother daily care and control of the child,&para;<br>while awarding the father “direct and regular” visitation&para;<br>rights, including visitation every other weekend and for&para;<br>the whole month of February each year. App. 9.&para;<br>Chilean law conferred upon Mr. Abbott what is com­&para;<br>monly known as a ne exeat right: a right to consent before&para;<br>Ms. Abbott could take A. J. A. out of Chile. See Minors&para;<br>Law 16,618, art. 49 (Chile), App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a&para;<br>(granting a ne exeat right to any parent with visitation&para;<br>rights). In effect a ne exeat right imposes a duty on one&para;<br>parent that is a right in the other. After Mr. Abbott ob­&para;<br>tained a British passport for A. J. A., Ms. Abbott grew&para;<br>concerned that Mr. Abbott would take the boy to Britain.&para;<br>She sought and obtained a “ne exeat of the minor” order&para;<br>from the Chilean family court, prohibiting the boy from&para;<br>being taken out of Chile.&para;<br>In August 2005, while proceedings before the Chilean&para;<br>court were pending, the mother removed the boy from&para;<br>Chile without permission from either the father or the&para;<br>court. A private investigator located the mother and the&para;<br>child in Texas. In February 2006, the mother filed for&para;<br>divorce in Texas state court. Part of the relief she sought&para;<br>was a modification of the father’s rights, including full&para;<br>power in her to determine the boy’s place of residence and&para;<br>an order limiting the father to supervised visitation in&para;<br>Texas. This litigation remains pending.&para;<br>Mr. Abbott brought an action in Texas state court,&para;<br>asking for visitation rights and an order requiring Ms.&para;<br>Abbott to show cause why the court should not allow Mr.&para;<br>Abbott to return to Chile with A. J. A. In February 2006,&para;<br>the court denied Mr. Abbott’s requested relief but granted&para;<br>him “liberal periods of possession” of A. J. A. throughout&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

He sought an order requiring his son’s return to&para;<br>Chile pursuant to the Convention and enforcement provi­&para;<br>sions of the ICARA. In July 2007, after holding a bench&para;<br>trial during which only Mr. Abbott testified, the District&para;<br>Court denied relief. The court held that the father’s ne&para;<br>exeat right did not constitute a right of custody under the&para;<br>Convention and, as a result, that the return remedy was&para;<br>not authorized. 495 F. Supp. 2d 635, 640.&para;<br>The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit&para;<br>affirmed on the same rationale. The court held the father&para;<br>possessed no rights of custody under the Convention be­&para;<br>cause his ne exeat right was only “a veto right over his&para;<br>son’s departure from Chile.” 542 F. 3d 1081, 1087 (2008).&para;<br>The court expressed substantial agreement with the Court&para;<br>of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Croll v. Croll, 229&para;<br>F. 3d 133 (2000). Relying on American dictionary defini­&para;<br>tions of “custody” and noting that ne exeat rights cannot be&para;<br>“ ‘actually exercised’ ” within the meaning of the Conven­&para;<br>tion, Croll held that ne exeat rights are not rights of cus­&para;<br>tody. Id., at 138–141 (quoting Art. 3(b), Treaty Doc., at 7).&para;<br>A dissenting opinion in Croll was filed by then-Judge&para;<br>Sotomayor. The dissent maintained that a ne exeat right&para;<br>is a right of custody because it “provides a parent with&para;<br>decisionmaking authority regarding a child’s international&para;<br>relocation.” 229 F. 3d, at 146.&para;<br>The Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth Circuits&para;<br>adopted the conclusion of the Croll majority. See Fawcett&para;<br>v. McRoberts, 326 F. 3d 491, 500 (CA4 2003); Gonzalez v.&para;<br>Gutierrez, 311 F. 3d 942, 949 (CA9 2002).

S. ___ (2009).&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Convention was adopted in 1980 in response to the&para;<br>problem of international child abductions during domestic&para;<br>disputes. The Convention seeks “to secure the prompt&para;<br>return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in&para;<br>any Contracting State,” and “to ensure that rights of&para;<br>custody and of access under the law of one Contracting&para;<br>State are effectively respected in the other Contracting&para;<br>States.” Art. 1, Treaty Doc., at 7.&para;<br>The provisions of the Convention of most relevance at&para;<br>the outset of this discussion are as follows:&para;<br>“Article 3: The removal or the retention of the child is&para;<br>to be considered wrongful where—&para;<br>“a it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a&para;<br>person, an institution or any other body, either jointly&para;<br>or alone, under the law of the State in which the child&para;<br>was habitually resident immediately before the re­&para;<br>moval or retention; and&para;<br>“b at the time of removal or retention those rights&para;<br>were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or&para;<br>would have been so exercised but for the removal or&para;<br>retention.&para;<br>.&para;<br>&para;<br>.&para;<br>&para;<br>.&para;<br>&para;<br>.&para;<br>&para;<br>.&para;<br>&para;<br>“Article 5: For the purposes of this Convention—&para;<br>“a ‘rights of custody’ shall include rights relating to&para;<br>the care of the person of the child and, in particular,&para;<br>the right to determine the child’s place of residence;&para;<br>“b ‘rights of access’ shall include the right to take a&para;<br>child for a limited period of time to a place other than&para;<br>the child’s habitual residence.&para;<br>.&para;<br>&para;<br>.&para;<br>&para;<br>.&para;<br>&para;<br>.&para;<br>&para;<br>.&para;<br>&para;<br>“Article 12: Where a child has been wrongfully re­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>moved or retained in terms of Article 3 . . . the author­&para;<br>ity concerned shall order the return of the child&para;<br>forthwith.” Id., at 7, 9.&para;<br>The Convention’s central operating feature is the return&para;<br>remedy. When a child under the age of 16 has been&para;<br>wrongfully removed or retained, the country to which the&para;<br>child has been brought must “order the return of the child&para;<br>forthwith,” unless certain exceptions apply. See, e.g., Arts.&para;<br>4, 12, ibid. A removal is “wrongful” where the child was&para;<br>removed in violation of “rights of custody.” The Conven­&para;<br>tion defines “rights of custody” to “include rights relating&para;<br>to the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the&para;<br>right to determine the child’s place of residence.” Art.&para;<br>5(a), id., at 7. A return remedy does not alter the pre-ab­&para;<br>duction allocation of custody rights but leaves custodial&para;<br>decisions to the courts of the country of habitual residence.&para;<br>Art. 19, id., at 11. The Convention also recognizes “rights&para;<br>of access,” but offers no return remedy for a breach of&para;<br>those rights. Arts. 5(b), 21, id., at 7, 11.&para;<br>The United States has implemented the Convention&para;<br>through the ICARA. The statute authorizes a person who&para;<br>seeks a child’s return to file a petition in state or federal&para;<br>court and instructs that the court “shall decide the case in&para;<br>accordance with the Convention.” 42 U. S. C. §§11603(a),&para;<br>(b), (d). If the child in question has been “wrongfully&para;<br>removed or retained within the meaning of the Conven­&para;<br>tion,” the child shall be “promptly returned,” unless an&para;<br>exception is applicable. §11601(a)(4).&para;<br>III&para;<br>As the parties agree, the Convention applies to this&para;<br>dispute. A. J. A. is under 16 years old; he was a habitual&para;<br>resident of Chile; and both Chile and the United States&para;<br>are contracting states. The question is whether A. J. A.&para;<br>was “wrongfully removed” from Chile, in other words,&para;<br>whether he was removed in violation of a right of custody.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. ABBOTT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>This Court’s inquiry is shaped by the text of the Conven­&para;<br>tion; the views of the United States Department of State;&para;<br>decisions addressing the meaning of “rights of custody” in&para;<br>courts of other contracting states; and the purposes of the&para;<br>Convention. After considering these sources, the Court&para;<br>determines that Mr. Abbott’s ne exeat right is a right of&para;<br>custody under the Convention.&para;<br>A&para;<br>“The interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of&para;<br>a statute, begins with its text.” Medellín v. Texas, 552&para;<br>U. S. 491, 506 (2008). This Court consults Chilean law to&para;<br>determine the content of Mr. Abbott’s right, while follow­&para;<br>ing the Convention’s text and structure to decide whether&para;<br>the right at issue is a “righ[t] of custody.”&para;<br>Chilean law granted Mr. Abbott a joint right to decide&para;<br>his child’s country of residence, otherwise known as a&para;<br>ne exeat right. Minors Law 16,618, art. 49 (Chile), App. to&para;<br>Pet. for Cert. 61a, 62a, provides that “[o]nce the court has&para;<br>decreed” that one of the parents has visitation rights, that&para;<br>parent’s “authorization . . . shall also be required” before&para;<br>the child may be taken out of the country, subject to court&para;<br>override only where authorization “cannot be granted or is&para;<br>denied without good reason.” Mr. Abbott has “direct and&para;<br>regular” visitation rights and it follows from Chilean law,&para;<br>that he has a shared right to determine his son’s country&para;<br>of residence under this provision. App. 9. To support the&para;<br>conclusion that Mr. Abbott’s right under Chilean law gives&para;<br>him a joint right to decide his son’s country of residence, it&para;<br>is notable that a Chilean agency has explained that Mi­&para;<br>nors Law 16,618 is a “right to authorize the minors’ exit”&para;<br>from Chile and that this provision means that neither&para;<br>parent can “unilaterally” “establish the [child’s] place of&para;<br>residence.” Letter from Paula Strap Camus, Director&para;<br>General, Corporation of Judicial Assistance of the Region&para;<br>Metropolitana, to National Center for Missing and Ex­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

Arribada Beaumont, No. 08–775, pp.&para;<br>35a–37a, cert. pending.&para;<br>The Convention recognizes that custody rights can be&para;<br>decreed jointly or alone, see Art. 3(a), Treaty Doc., at 7;&para;<br>and Mr. Abbott’s joint right to determine his son’s country&para;<br>of residence is best classified as a joint right of custody, as&para;<br>the Convention defines that term. The Convention defines&para;<br>“rights of custody” to “include rights relating to the care of&para;<br>the person of the child and, in particular, the right to&para;<br>determine the child’s place of residence.” Art. 5(a), ibid.&para;<br>Mr. Abbott’s ne exeat right gives him both the joint “right&para;<br>to determine the child’s place of residence” and joint&para;<br>“rights relating to the care of the person of the child.”&para;<br>Mr. Abbott’s joint right to decide A. J. A.’s country of&para;<br>residence allows him to “determine the child’s place of&para;<br>residence.” The phrase “place of residence” encompasses&para;<br>the child’s country of residence, especially in light of the&para;<br>Convention’s explicit purpose to prevent wrongful removal&para;<br>across international borders. See Convention Preamble,&para;<br>Treaty Doc., at 7. And even if “place of residence” refers&para;<br>only to the child’s street address within a country, a&para;<br>ne exeat right still entitles Mr. Abbott to “determine” that&para;<br>place. “[D]etermine” can mean “[t]o fix conclusively or&para;<br>authoritatively,” Webster’s New International Dictionary&para;<br>711 (2d ed. 1954) (2d definition), but it can also mean “[t]o&para;<br>set bounds or limits to,” ibid. (1st definition), which is&para;<br>what Mr. Abbott’s ne exeat right allows by ensuring that&para;<br>A. J. A. cannot live at any street addresses outside of&para;<br>Chile. It follows that the Convention’s protection of a&para;<br>parent’s custodial “right to determine the child’s place of&para;<br>residence” includes a ne exeat right.&para;<br>Mr. Abbott’s joint right to determine A. J. A.’s country of&para;<br>residence also gives him “rights relating to the care of the&para;<br>person of the child.” Art. 5(a), Treaty Doc., at 7. Few&para;<br>decisions are as significant as the language the child&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. ABBOTT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>speaks, the identity he finds, or the culture and traditions&para;<br>she will come to absorb. These factors, so essential to self­&para;<br>definition, are linked in an inextricable way to the child’s&para;<br>country of residence. One need only consider the different&para;<br>childhoods an adolescent will experience if he or she grows&para;<br>up in the United States, Chile, Germany, or North Korea,&para;<br>to understand how choosing a child’s country of residence&para;<br>is a right “relating to the care of the person of the child.”&para;<br>The Court of Appeals described Mr. Abbott’s right to take&para;<br>part in making this decision as a mere “veto,” 542 F. 3d, at&para;<br>1087; but even by that truncated description, the father&para;<br>has an essential role in deciding the boy’s country of resi­&para;<br>dence. For example, Mr. Abbott could condition his con­&para;<br>sent to a change in country on A. J. A.’s moving to a city&para;<br>outside Chile where Mr. Abbott could obtain an astronomy&para;<br>position, thus allowing the father to have continued con­&para;<br>tact with the boy.&para;<br>That a ne exeat right does not fit within traditional&para;<br>notions of physical custody is beside the point. The Con­&para;<br>vention defines “rights of custody,” and it is that definition&para;<br>that a court must consult. This uniform, text-based ap­&para;<br>proach ensures international consistency in interpreting&para;<br>the Convention. It forecloses courts from relying on defi­&para;<br>nitions of custody confined by local law usage, definitions&para;<br>that may undermine recognition of custodial arrange­&para;<br>ments in other countries or in different legal traditions,&para;<br>including the civil-law tradition. And, in any case, our&para;<br>own legal system has adopted conceptions of custody that&para;<br>accord with the Convention’s broad definition. Joint legal&para;<br>custody, in which one parent cares for the child while the&para;<br>other has joint decisionmaking authority concerning the&para;<br>child’s welfare, has become increasingly common. See&para;<br>Singer, Dispute Resolution and the Postdivorce Family:&para;<br>Implications of a Paradigm Shift, 47 Family Ct. Rev. 363,&para;<br>366 (2009) (“[A] recent study of child custody outcomes in&para;<br>North Carolina indicated that almost 70% of all custody&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>resolutions included joint legal custody, as did over 90% of&para;<br>all mediated custody agreements”); E.

Rev. 495, 505–508 (2001).&para;<br>Ms. Abbott gets the analysis backwards in claiming that&para;<br>a ne exeat right is not a right of custody because the Con­&para;<br>vention requires that any right of custody must be capable&para;<br>of exercise. The Convention protects rights of custody&para;<br>when “at the time of removal or retention those rights&para;<br>were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would&para;<br>have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.”&para;<br>Art. 3(b), Treaty Doc., at 7. In cases like this one, a&para;<br>ne exeat right is by its nature inchoate and so has no&para;<br>operative force except when the other parent seeks to&para;<br>remove the child from the country. If that occurs, the&para;<br>parent can exercise the ne exeat right by declining consent&para;<br>to the exit or placing conditions to ensure the move will be&para;<br>in the child’s best interests. When one parent removes the&para;<br>child without seeking the ne exeat holder’s consent, it is an&para;<br>instance where the right would have been “exercised but&para;<br>for the removal or retention.” Ibid.&para;<br>The Court of Appeals’ conclusion that a breach of a ne&para;<br>exeat right does not give rise to a return remedy would&para;<br>render the Convention meaningless in many cases where&para;<br>it is most needed. The Convention provides a return&para;<br>remedy when a parent takes a child across international&para;<br>borders in violation of a right of custody. The Convention&para;<br>provides no return remedy when a parent removes a child&para;<br>in violation of a right of access but requires contracting&para;<br>states “to promote the peaceful enjoyment of access&para;<br>rights.” Art. 21, id., at 11. For example, a court may force&para;<br>the custodial parent to pay the travel costs of visitation,&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. ABBOTT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>see, e.g., Viragh v. Foldes, 415 Mass. 96, 109–111, 612&para;<br>N. E. 2d 241, 249–250 (1993), or make other provisions for&para;<br>the noncustodial parent to visit his or her child, see&para;<br>§11603(b) (authorizing petitions to “secur[e] the effective&para;<br>exercise of rights of access to a child”). But unlike rights&para;<br>of access, ne exeat rights can only be honored with a return&para;<br>remedy because these rights depend on the child’s location&para;<br>being the country of habitual residence.&para;<br>Any suggestion that a ne exeat right is a “righ[t] of&para;<br>access” is illogical and atextual. The Convention defines&para;<br>“rights of access” as “includ[ing] the right to take a child&para;<br>for a limited period of time to a place other than the child’s&para;<br>habitual residence,” Art. 5(b), Treaty Doc., at 7, and&para;<br>ICARA defines that same term as “visitation rights,”&para;<br>§11602(7). The joint right to decide a child’s country of&para;<br>residence is not even arguably a “right to take a child for a&para;<br>limited period of time” or a “visitation righ[t].” Reaching&para;<br>the commonsense conclusion that a ne exeat right does not&para;<br>fit these definitions of “rights of access” honors the Con­&para;<br>vention’s distinction between rights of access and rights of&para;<br>custody.&para;<br>Ms. Abbott argues that the ne exeat order in this case&para;<br>cannot create a right of custody because it merely protects&para;<br>a court’s jurisdiction over the child. Even if this argument&para;<br>were correct, it would not be dispositive. Ms. Abbott&para;<br>contends the Chilean court’s ne exeat order contains no&para;<br>parental consent provision and so awards the father no&para;<br>rights, custodial or otherwise. See Brief for Respondent&para;<br>22; but see 495 F. Supp. 2d, at 638, n. 3 (the District Court&para;<br>treating the order as containing a consent provision); 542&para;<br>F. 3d, at 1084 (same for the Court of Appeals). Even a&para;<br>ne exeat order issued to protect a court’s jurisdiction pend­&para;<br>ing issuance of further decrees is consistent with allowing&para;<br>a parent to object to the child’s removal from the country.&para;<br>This Court need not decide the status of ne exeat orders&para;<br>lacking parental consent provisions, however; for here the&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>father relies on his rights under Minors Law 16,618. Mr.&para;<br>Abbott’s rights derive not from the order but from Minors&para;<br>Law 16,618. That law requires the father’s consent before&para;<br>the mother can remove the boy from Chile, subject only to&para;<br>the equitable power family courts retain to override any&para;<br>joint custodial arrangements in times of disagreement.&para;<br>Minors Law 16,618; see 1 J. Atkinson, Modern Child&para;<br>Custody Practice §6–11 (2d ed. 2009) (“[T]he court remains&para;<br>the final arbiter and may resolve the [dispute between&para;<br>joint custodians] itself or designate one parent as having&para;<br>final authority on certain issues affecting the child”);&para;<br>Lombardo v.

The consent provision in&para;<br>Minors Law 16,618 confers upon the father the joint right&para;<br>to determine his child’s country of residence. This is a&para;<br>right of custody under the Convention.&para;<br>B&para;<br>This Court’s conclusion that Mr. Abbott possesses a&para;<br>right of custody under the Convention is supported and&para;<br>informed by the State Department’s view on the issue.&para;<br>The United States has endorsed the view that ne exeat&para;<br>rights are rights of custody. In its brief before this Court&para;<br>the United States advises that “the Department of State,&para;<br>whose Office of Children’s Issues serves as the Central&para;<br>Authority for the United States under the Convention, has&para;<br>long understood the Convention as including ne exeat&para;<br>rights among the protected ‘rights of custody.’ ” Brief for&para;<br>United States as Amicus Curiae 21; see Sumitomo Shoji&para;<br>America, Inc. v.

The principle applies with special&para;<br>force here, for Congress has directed that “uniform inter­&para;<br>national interpretation of the Convention” is part of the&para;<br>Convention’s framework. See §11601(b)(3)(B).&para;<br>A review of the international case law confirms broad&para;<br>acceptance of the rule that ne exeat rights are rights of&para;<br>custody.

ABBOTT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>rights of custody. The Report explains that rather than&para;<br>defining custody in precise terms or referring to the laws&para;<br>of different nations pertaining to parental rights, the&para;<br>Convention uses the unadorned term “rights of custody” to&para;<br>recognize “all the ways in which custody of children can be&para;<br>exercised” through “a flexible interpretation of the terms&para;<br>used, which allows the greatest possible number of cases&para;<br>to be brought into consideration.” Id., ¶¶67, 71, at 446,&para;<br>447–448. Thus the Report rejects the notion that because&para;<br>ne exeat rights do not encompass the right to make medi­&para;<br>cal or some other important decisions about a child’s life&para;<br>they cannot be rights of custody. Indeed, the Report is&para;<br>fully consistent with the conclusion that ne exeat rights&para;<br>are just one of the many “ways in which custody of chil­&para;<br>dren can be exercised.” Id., ¶ 71, at 447.&para;<br>D&para;<br>Adopting the view that the Convention provides a re­&para;<br>turn remedy for violations of ne exeat rights accords with&para;<br>its objects and purposes. The Convention is based on the&para;<br>principle that the best interests of the child are well&para;<br>served when decisions regarding custody rights are made&para;<br>in the country of habitual residence. See Convention&para;<br>Preamble, Treaty Doc., at 7. Ordering a return remedy&para;<br>does not alter the existing allocation of custody rights, Art.&para;<br>19, id., at 11, but does allow the courts of the home coun­&para;<br>try to decide what is in the child’s best interests. It is the&para;<br>Convention’s premise that courts in contracting states will&para;<br>make this determination in a responsible manner.&para;<br>Custody decisions are often difficult. Judges must strive&para;<br>always to avoid a common tendency to prefer their own&para;<br>society and culture, a tendency that ought not interfere&para;<br>with objective consideration of all the factors that should&para;<br>be weighed in determining the best interests of the child.&para;<br>This judicial neutrality is presumed from the mandate of&para;<br>the Convention, which affirms that the contracting states&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>are “[f]irmly convinced that the interests of children are of&para;<br>paramount importance in matters relating to their cus­&para;<br>tody.” Convention Preamble, Treaty Doc., at 7. Interna­&para;<br>tional law serves a high purpose when it underwrites&para;<br>the determination by nations to rely upon their domes­&para;<br>tic courts to enforce just laws by legitimate and fair&para;<br>proceedings.&para;<br>To interpret the Convention to permit an abducting&para;<br>parent to avoid a return remedy, even when the other&para;<br>parent holds a ne exeat right, would run counter to the&para;<br>Convention’s purpose of deterring child abductions by&para;<br>parents who attempt to find a friendlier forum for deciding&para;<br>custodial disputes. Ms. Abbott removed A. J. A. from&para;<br>Chile while Mr. Abbott’s request to enhance his relation­&para;<br>ship with his son was still pending before Chilean courts.&para;<br>After she landed in Texas, the mother asked the state&para;<br>court to diminish or eliminate the father’s custodial and&para;<br>visitation rights. The Convention should not be inter­&para;<br>preted to permit a parent to select which country will&para;<br>adjudicate these questions by bringing the child to a dif­&para;<br>ferent country, in violation of a ne exeat right. Denying a&para;<br>return remedy for the violation of such rights would “le­&para;<br>gitimize the very action—removal of the child—that the&para;<br>home country, through its custody order [or other provi­&para;<br>sion of law], sought to prevent” and would allow “parents&para;<br>to undermine the very purpose of the Convention.” Croll,&para;<br>229 F. 3d, at 147 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). This Court&para;<br>should be most reluctant to adopt an interpretation that&para;<br>gives an abducting parent an advantage by coming here to&para;<br>avoid a return remedy that is granted, for instance, in the&para;<br>United Kingdom, Israel, Germany, and South Africa. See&para;<br>supra, at 12–13.&para;<br>Requiring a return remedy in cases like this one helps&para;<br>deter child abductions and respects the Convention’s&para;<br>purpose to prevent harms resulting from abductions. An&para;<br>abduction can have devastating consequences for a child.&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. ABBOTT&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“Some child psychologists believe that the trauma children&para;<br>suffer from these abductions is one of the worst forms of&para;<br>child abuse.” H. R. Rep. No. 103–390, p. 2 (1993). A child&para;<br>abducted by one parent is separated from the second&para;<br>parent and the child’s support system. Studies have&para;<br>shown that separation by abduction can cause psychologi­&para;<br>cal problems ranging from depression and acute stress&para;<br>disorder to posttraumatic stress disorder and identity­&para;<br>formation issues.

ABBOTT&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Article 3 of the Convention provides that the removal or&para;<br>retention of a child is “wrongful,” and thus in violation of&para;<br>the Convention, only when the removal “is in breach of the&para;<br>rights of custody.” Art. 3(a), ibid. The fact that a removal&para;<br>may be “wrongful” in the sense that it violates domestic&para;<br>law or violates only “rights of access” does not make it&para;<br>“wrongful” within the meaning of the Convention.&para;<br>Only when a removal is “wrongful” under Article 3 may&para;<br>the parent who possesses custody rights force the child’s&para;<br>return to the country of habitual residence under the&para;<br>Convention’s remedial procedures, pursuant to Articles 8&para;<br>through 20. For those removals that frustrate a noncusto­&para;<br>dial parent’s “rights of access,” the Convention provides&para;<br>that the noncustodial parent may file an application “to&para;<br>make arrangements for organizing or securing the effec­&para;<br>tive exercise of rights of access”; but he may not force the&para;<br>child’s return. Art. 21, id., at 11. A parent without “rights&para;<br>of custody,” therefore, does not have the power granted by&para;<br>Article 3 to compel the child’s return to his or her country&para;<br>of habitual residence. His rights are limited to those set&para;<br>forth in Article 21.&para;<br>II&para;<br>Mr. Abbott, claiming “rights of custody” by virtue of the&para;<br>travel restriction Chilean law places on Ms. Abbott, seeks&para;<br>the return of A.

A.’s removal was “wrongful” within the mean­&para;<br>ing of the Convention; as such, it must have been “in&para;<br>breach of [Mr. Abbott’s] rights of custody.”2 Art. 3, id., at&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Indisputably,&para;<br>&para;<br>Ms. Abbott’s removal of A.

Putting aside the effect of the travel restriction, it is&para;<br>undisputed that Ms. Abbott possesses “rights of custody”&para;<br>over A. J.

The only issue in&para;<br>this case, therefore, is whether Mr. Abbott also possesses&para;<br>“rights of custody” within the meaning of the Convention&para;<br>by virtue of the travel restriction, or ne exeat clause,3 that&para;<br>Chilean law imposes on Ms. Abbott. In other words, the&para;<br>question is whether the “right” of one parent to veto the&para;<br>other parent’s decision to remove a child from the country,&para;<br>subject to judicial override, belongs in the category of&para;<br>“rights relating to the care of the person of the child and,&para;<br>in particular, the right to determine the child’s place of&para;<br>residence.” Art. 5(a), Treaty Doc., at 7. In my judgment,&para;<br>it clearly does not, and I need look no further than to the&para;<br>Convention’s text to explain why. See Medellín v. Texas,&para;<br>552 U.

The Court con­&para;<br>cludes that the veto power Mr. Abbott has over Ms. Ab­&para;<br>bott’s travel plans is equivalent to those rights “ ‘relating&para;<br>to the care of the person of the child.’ ” Ante, at 7–8. This&para;<br>is so, the Court tells us, because Mr. Abbott has a limited&para;<br>power to keep A. J. A. within Chile’s bounds and, there­&para;<br>fore, indirectly to influence “the language the child speaks,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>was only wrongful within the meaning of the Convention if it was in&para;<br>breach of Mr. Abbott’s rights of custody. Unfortunately, I fear the&para;<br>Court’s preoccupation with deterring parental misconduct—even,&para;<br>potentially, at the sake of the best interests of the child—has caused it&para;<br>to minimize this important distinction.&para;<br>3 The Court repeatedly refers to “ne exeat rights,” ante, at 3, 10, 11,&para;<br>12, 14, 15, and 16, as if the single travel restriction at issue in this case&para;<br>were on a par with the multiple rights commonly exercised by custodial&para;<br>parents. Chile’s statutory ne exeat provision is better characterized as&para;<br>a restriction on the travel of both the minor and the custodial parent&para;<br>than as a bundle of “rights” possessed by the noncustodial parent.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. ABBOTT&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the identity he finds, or the culture and traditions she will&para;<br>come to absorb.” Ante, at 7. It is not nearly as self-evident&para;<br>as the Court assumes that Mr. Abbott’s veto power carries&para;<br>with it any ability to decide the language A. J. A. speaks&para;<br>or the cultural experiences he will have, ante, at 7–8. A. J.&para;<br>A.’s mere presence in Chile does not determine any num­&para;<br>ber of issues, including: whether A. J. A. learns Spanish&para;<br>while there; whether he attends an American school or a&para;<br>British school or a local school; whether he participates in&para;<br>sports; whether he is raised Catholic or Jewish or Bud­&para;<br>dhist or atheist; whether he eats a vegetarian diet; and on&para;<br>and on. The travel restriction does not confer upon Mr.&para;<br>Abbott affirmative power to make any number of decisions&para;<br>that are vital to A. J. A.’s physical, psychological, and&para;<br>cultural development. To say that a limited power to veto&para;<br>a child’s travel plans confers, also, a right “relating to the&para;<br>care” of that child devalues the great wealth of decisions a&para;<br>custodial parent makes on a daily basis to attend to a&para;<br>child’s needs and development.&para;<br>The Court’s interpretation depends entirely on a broad&para;<br>reading of the phrase “relating to” in the Convention’s&para;<br>definition of “rights of custody.” It is, undeniably, broad&para;<br>language. But, as the Court reads the term, it is so broad&para;<br>as to be utterly unhelpful in interpreting what “rights of&para;<br>custody” means. We “cannot forget that we ultimately are&para;<br>determining the meaning of the term” rights of custody in&para;<br>this case, and we should not lose sight of the import of this&para;<br>term in construing the broad words that follow in its wake.&para;<br>Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11 (2004). I suppose it&para;<br>could be said that Mr. Abbott’s ability to decide whether&para;<br>A. J. A. spends the night with one of his friends during a&para;<br>Saturday visit is also a “right relating to the care of the&para;<br>child.” Taken in the abstract—and to its most absurd—&para;<br>any decision on behalf of a child could be construed as a&para;<br>right “relating to” the care of a child.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Such a view of the text obliterates the careful distinction&para;<br>the drafters drew between the rights of custody and the&para;<br>rights of access. Undoubtedly, they were aware of the&para;<br>concept of joint custody. See Pérez-Vera Report ¶71, at&para;<br>457 (“[C]ustody rights may have been awarded . . . to that&para;<br>person in his own right or jointly. It cannot be otherwise&para;<br>in an era when types of joint custody, regarded as best&para;<br>suited to the general principle of sexual non­&para;<br>discrimination, are gradually being introduced into inter­&para;<br>nal law”). But just because rights of custody can be shared&para;<br>by two parents, it does not follow that the drafters in­&para;<br>tended this limited veto power to be a right of custody.&para;<br>And yet this, it seems, is how the Court understands the&para;<br>case: Because the drafters intended to account for joint&para;<br>custodial arrangements, they intended for this travel&para;<br>restriction to be joint custody because it could be said, in&para;<br>some abstract sense, to relate to care of the child. I fail to&para;<br>understand how the Court’s reading is faithful to the&para;<br>Convention’s text and purpose, given that the text ex­&para;<br>pressly contemplates two distinct classes of parental&para;<br>rights. Today’s decision converts every noncustodial par­&para;<br>ent with access rights—at least in Chile—into a custodial&para;<br>parent for purposes of the Convention.&para;<br>On this point, it is important to observe the effect of the&para;<br>Court’s decision to classify the travel restriction as a right&para;<br>“relating to” A. J. A.’s care. Mr. Abbott possesses no legal&para;<br>authority presently to exercise care or control of A. J. A.,&para;<br>or to make decisions on his behalf. The Court would nev­&para;<br>ertheless read the Convention to require A. J. A.’s return&para;<br>to a parent without such rights merely because the travel&para;<br>restriction, in an abstract sense, could be said to relate to&para;<br>A. J. A.’s care. The Court fails to explain how a parent&para;<br>who otherwise possesses no legal authority to exercise&para;<br>“charge,” “supervision,” or “management” over a child, see&para;<br>Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 338 (1986)&para;<br>(hereinafter Webster’s) (5th definition of “care”), can be­&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. ABBOTT&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>come a joint custodian of a child merely because he can&para;<br>attempt to veto one of the countless decisions the child’s&para;<br>other parent has sole legal authority to make on the&para;<br>child’s behalf.&para;<br>The right to determine the child’s place of residence. The&para;<br>Court also concludes that Mr. Abbott’s veto power satisfies&para;<br>the Convention’s definition of custodial rights because it&para;<br>is, in the Court’s view, a “right to determine the child’s&para;<br>place of residence.” Art. 5(a), Treaty Doc., at 7. I disagree&para;<br>with the Court’s assessment of the significance and mean­&para;<br>ing of this phrase, both on its face and within the context&para;<br>of the Convention’s other provisions.&para;<br>As an initial matter, the Court’s reading of the Conven­&para;<br>tion depends on isolating the phrase “and, in particular,&para;<br>the right to determine the child’s place of residence” to&para;<br>refer to a freestanding right separate and apart from the&para;<br>rights related to the care of the child. I do not agree with&para;<br>this view of the text, nor did the Convention’s drafters:&para;<br>“The Convention seeks to be more precise by empha­&para;<br>sizing, as an example of the ‘care’ referred to [in the&para;<br>“ ‘rights of custody’ ” clause, Art. 5(a)], the right to de­&para;<br>termine the child’s place of residence. However, if the&para;<br>child, although still a minor at law, has the right itself&para;<br>to determine its own place of residence, the substance&para;<br>of the custody rights will have to be determined in the&para;<br>context of other rights concerning the person of the&para;<br>child.” Pérez-Vera Report ¶84, at 452 (emphasis&para;<br>added).&para;<br>The drafters thus intended the “right to determine the&para;<br>child’s place of residence” to be an “example” of what the&para;<br>Convention means by “care of the person of the child.” It&para;<br>is indicative of the “substance” of what it means to be a&para;<br>custodial parent. The definition is not, as the Court would&para;<br>have it, one stick in the bundle that may be parsed as a&para;<br>singular “ ‘righ[t] of custody,’ ” ante, at 1; rather, it is a&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

The parent responsible for determining where&para;<br>and with whom a child resides, the drafters assumed,&para;<br>would likely also be the parent who has the responsibility&para;<br>to “care” for the child.&para;<br>Yet even assuming, as the Court does, that the “right to&para;<br>determine the child’s place of residence,” Art. 5(a), Treaty&para;<br>Doc., at 7, is divisible from the “care” of the child, ibid., I&para;<br>still fail to understand how a travel restriction on one&para;<br>parent’s exercise of her custodial rights is equivalent to an&para;<br>affirmative “right to determine the child’s place of resi­&para;<br>dence.” Analyzing its text, in the context of the Conven­&para;<br>tion’s focus on distinguishing custodial parents from non­&para;<br>custodial ones, leads me to conclude that the “right to&para;<br>determine the child’s place of residence” means the power&para;<br>to set or fix the location of the child’s home. It does not&para;<br>refer to the more abstract power to keep a child within one&para;<br>nation’s borders.&para;<br>“To determine” means “to fix conclusively or authorita­&para;<br>tively” or “to settle a question or controversy.”4 Webster’s&para;<br>616. A “place” is a “physical environment” or “a building&para;<br>or locality used for a special purpose.” Id., at 1727. “Resi­&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 “To determine” can also mean, as the Court observes, “ ‘to set&para;<br>bounds or limits to,’ ” ante, at 7 (quoting Webster’s New International&para;<br>Dictionary 711 (2d ed. 1954) (1st definition) (hereinafter Webster’s 2d)).&para;<br>However, this definition of “to determine” makes little functional sense&para;<br>as applied to this treaty. In the context of understanding the meaning&para;<br>of rights of custody, the phrase “to determine” cannot be so indetermi­&para;<br>nate as to merely set “limits to” a child’s place of residence.&para;<br>Although the Court emphasizes that the definition of “to deter­&para;<br>mine” on which it relies is the first such entry in Webster’s, ante, at 7, it&para;<br>is worth noting that surely the Court would not rely on the first such&para;<br>definition of the word “care” in that source (“suffering of mind; grief;&para;<br>sorrow”) to understand the Convention’s use of that word. See Web­&para;<br>ster’s 2d, at 405. Instead, the fifth definition of that word—“charge,&para;<br>supervision, management”—is clearly the relevant one. The point is&para;<br>only that context, as well as common sense, matters when selecting&para;<br>among possible definitions.&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. ABBOTT&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>dence,” even standing alone, refers to a particular loca­&para;<br>tion—and not, more generally, to a nation or country. In&para;<br>the law, “residence” can mean: “[t]he act or fact of living in&para;<br>a given place for some time”; “[t]he place where one actu­&para;<br>ally lives”; or, “[a] house or other fixed abode; a dwelling.”&para;<br>Black’s Law Dictionary 1423 (9th ed. 2009).5 Lay defini­&para;<br>tions of “residence” similarly describe a specific location:&para;<br>“the act or fact of abiding or dwelling in a place for some&para;<br>time”; “the place where one actually lives or has his&para;<br>home”; or, “a temporary or permanent dwelling place,&para;<br>abode, or habitation.” Webster’s 1931. It follows that a&para;<br>“place of residence” describes a “physical” location in&para;<br>which a child “actually lives.”&para;<br>The Court’s reading of this text depends on its substitu­&para;<br>tion of the word “country” for the word “place.” Such a&para;<br>substitution is not illogical, of course, in light of the Con­&para;<br>vention’s international focus. See Croll v. Croll, 229 F. 3d&para;<br>133, 147, 148 (CA2 2000) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (read­&para;<br>ing “place of residence” to mean “authority over the child’s&para;<br>more specific living arrangements” “ignores the basic&para;<br>international character of the Hague Convention”). But it&para;<br>is inconsistent with the Convention’s text and purpose.&para;<br>When the drafters wanted to refer to country, they did.&para;<br>For example, in Article 3, the drafters explained that&para;<br>rights of custody should be defined by looking to “the law&para;<br>of the State in which the child was habitually resident.”&para;<br>Art. 3(a), Treaty Doc., at 7.

The point is: When the drafters&para;<br>wanted to refer to a particular geographic unit, they&para;<br>did so.&para;<br>Instead, the drafters elected the formulation “place of&para;<br>residence,” which is also utilized similarly in the definition&para;<br>of “rights of access.” See Art. 5(b), id., at 7 (defining&para;<br>“ ‘rights of access’ ” to include “the right to take a child for&para;<br>a limited period of time to a place other than the child’s&para;<br>habitual residence” (emphasis added)). And they utilized&para;<br>this phrase only within one particular Article, as opposed&para;<br>to their more frequent use of “State of habitual residence”&para;<br>throughout the Convention. In interpreting statutory&para;<br>text, we ordinarily presume that the use of different words&para;<br>is purposeful and evinces an intention to convey a differ­&para;<br>ent meaning.

There&para;<br>is no reason we should presume otherwise in the context of&para;<br>treaties.&para;<br>Accordingly, I would give “place of residence” the loca­&para;<br>tion-specific meaning its plain text connotes, irrespective&para;<br>of the fact that this Convention concerns international&para;<br>abduction. The right described by the Convention is the&para;<br>right to decide, conclusively, where a child’s home will be.&para;<br>And this makes a good deal of sense. The child lives with&para;<br>the parent who has custodial rights or, in the language of&para;<br>the Convention, “care of the person of the child,” Art. 5(a),&para;<br>Treaty Doc., at 7. The child’s home—his or her “place of&para;<br>residence”—is fixed by the custody arrangement.7 This&para;<br>comports too with the Convention’s decision to privilege&para;<br>the rights of custodians over the rights of those parents&para;<br>with only visitation rights.&para;<br>Understanding the effect of a travel restriction. So, the&para;<br>question we confront is whether a travel restriction on one&para;<br>parent’s right to embark on international travel with his&para;<br>or her child creates in the other parent a “right to deter­&para;<br>mine the child’s place of residence” or the ability “to fix&para;<br>conclusively” the child’s “physical” “home.” Before answer­&para;<br>ing this question, it is important to understand the nature&para;<br>of the travel restriction we must classify.&para;<br>The departure of a minor from Chile—including when&para;<br>that child lives in a married, two-parent household—is&para;<br>governed by Article 49 of §16,618 of that country’s Minors&para;<br>Law.

ABBOTT&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>the restriction Chilean law places on Ms. Abbott’s move­&para;<br>ment, Mr. Abbott has no “right to determine [A. J. A.’s]&para;<br>place of residence.” He cannot “conclusively” “fix,” “settle,”&para;<br>or “determine” the place where A. J. A. “actually lives or&para;<br>has his home.” See supra, at 9–10. True, the travel re­&para;<br>striction bestows upon the noncustodial parent a limited&para;<br>power to prevent his child from leaving the country with­&para;<br>out his permission, but it does not grant an affirmative&para;<br>power to fix or set the location of the child’s home. Mr.&para;<br>Abbott has no power whatever to determine where A. J. A.&para;<br>actually lives within the nearly 300,000 square miles that&para;<br>compose Chile. Even more important, Mr. Abbott has no&para;<br>power whatever to select another country in which A. J. A.&para;<br>would live, were Mr. Abbott’s work to take him to another&para;<br>country altogether. In sum, a right to object to a proposed&para;<br>departure gives a parent far less authority than a right to&para;<br>determine where the child shall reside. Moreover, the&para;<br>right to determine where to live within a country, as well&para;<br>as what country to live in, is far broader than the limited&para;<br>right to object to a child’s travel abroad.&para;<br>In my view, the “right” Mr. Abbott has by virtue of the&para;<br>travel restriction is therefore best understood as relating&para;<br>to his “rights of access,” as the Convention defines that&para;<br>term—and not as a standalone “ ‘righ[t] of custody,’ ” as the&para;<br>Court defines it, ante, at 1. Chile’s statutory travel re­&para;<br>striction provision is plainly ancillary to the access rights&para;<br>the Chilean family court granted to him as the noncusto­&para;<br>dial parent. By its terms, the obligation on the custodial&para;<br>parent to seek the other parent’s permission before remov­&para;<br>ing the child from Chile only operates upon the award of&para;<br>visitation rights; it has nothing to do with custody rights.&para;<br>And it operates automatically to facilitate the noncusto­&para;<br>dial parent’s ability to access the child and to exercise his&para;<br>visitation rights. In the best of all possible circumstances,&para;<br>Mr. Abbott’s limited veto power assures him relatively&para;<br>easy access to A. J.

But this power, standing&para;<br>alone, does not transform him into a custodian for pur­&para;<br>poses of the Convention’s return remedy. Instead, it au­&para;<br>thorizes him, pursuant to Article 21, to seek assistance&para;<br>from this country in carrying out the Chilean family&para;<br>court’s visitation order.&para;<br>III&para;<br>Although the Court recognizes, as it must, that “ ‘[t]he&para;<br>interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of a&para;<br>statute, begins with its text,’ ” ante, at 6 (quoting Medellín,&para;<br>552 U. S., at 506), the Court’s analysis is atextual—at&para;<br>least as far as the Convention’s text goes. The Court first&para;<br>relies on the text of the Chilean law at issue and a single&para;<br>Chilean administrator’s alleged interpretation thereof.9&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 Because&para;<br>&para;<br>differences in statutory provisions, as well as cultural&para;<br>differences and personal predilections, may affect the opinions of local&para;<br>officials, I would attach no weight to the letter from Paula Strap&para;<br>Camus, describing Article 49 of Chile’s Minors Law 16,618 as establish­&para;<br>ing a shared right to determine the place of residence of a child.&para;<br>Moreover, we have no obligation to defer, on questions of treaty inter­&para;<br>pretation, to the nonjudicial decisions of another signatory state, let&para;<br>alone a return request—a piece of advocacy—filed on behalf of Chile in&para;<br>another case.&para;<br>In any event, the letter cited offers much less support for the Court’s&para;<br>position than meets the eye. Unlike in this case, in which a Chilean&para;<br>court has already decreed Ms. Abbott to be A. J. A.’s sole custodian, in&para;<br>Villegas Duran v. Beaumont, “no Judge of the Republic of Chile has&para;<br>granted the custody of the child to her mother . . . .” Letter from Paula&para;<br>Strap Camus, Director General, Corporation of Judicial Assistance of&para;<br>the Region Metropolitana to National Center for Missing and Exploited&para;<br>Children (Jan. 17, 2006), App. to Pet. for Cert. in Villegas Duran v.&para;<br>Beaumont, O. T. 2008, No. 08–775, p. 36a. In other words, Ms. Camus’&para;<br>letter request for the child’s return in that case depends on a provision&para;<br>of Article 49 not at issue in this case: “If the custody of a legitimate&para;<br>child has not been entrusted by the judge to any of his parents or to a&para;<br>third party, the child may not leave without authorization of both&para;<br>parents.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. The travel restriction that bound&para;<br>Ms. Abbott in this case, however, arose “[o]nce the court . . . decreed the&para;<br>obligation to allow visits” by Mr. Abbott. Ibid. Although not before us,&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. ABBOTT&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>See ante, at 6. While it is true that the meaning of Chile’s&para;<br>statute matters to our determining whether a parent has&para;<br>taken a child in “breach of rights of custody . . . under the&para;<br>law of the State in which the child was habitually resident&para;<br>immediately before the removal or retention,” Art. 3(a),&para;<br>Treaty Doc., at 7, it does not and should not inform what&para;<br>the Convention’s definition of “rights of custody” means in&para;<br>the first place.&para;<br>The Court also reminds us that the Convention’s terms&para;<br>are to be broadly construed. See ante, at 15–16. To be&para;<br>sure, the Convention’s leading interpretive authority&para;<br>informs us that the Convention’s understanding of what&para;<br>constitutes “rights of custody” is broad and flexible. See&para;<br>Pérez-Vera Report ¶¶67, 71, 84, at 446, 447, 451–452.&para;<br>And we are to apply its terms to “allo[w] the greatest&para;<br>possible number of cases to be brought into consideration.”&para;<br>Id., ¶67, at 446. But such breadth should not circumvent&para;<br>the Convention’s text in order to sweep a travel restriction&para;<br>under the umbrella of rights of custody.&para;<br>A reading as broad and flexible as the Court’s eviscer­&para;<br>ates the distinction the Convention draws between rights&para;<br>of custody and rights of access. Indeed, the Court’s read­&para;<br>ing essentially voids the Convention’s Article 21, which&para;<br>provides a separate remedy for breaches of rights of ac­&para;<br>cess. If a violation of this type of provision were not a&para;<br>breach of the rights of access, I find it quite difficult to&para;<br>imagine what the Convention’s drafters had in mind when&para;<br>——————&para;<br>there may be a sound basis for distinguishing the legal effect and&para;<br>significance of a travel restriction in effect prior to an award of custody&para;<br>to either or both parents, from one that occurs ancillary to the award of&para;<br>visitation rights to a parent who has no custodial rights. Moreover, the&para;<br>U. S. Department of State, at the time the Convention was ratified,&para;<br>believed that the Convention would require return in these circum­&para;<br>stances: “Children who are wrongfully removed or retained prior to the&para;<br>entry of a custody order are protected by the Convention. There need&para;<br>not be a custody order in effect in order to invoke the Convention’s&para;<br>return provisions.” Convention Analysis 10505.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

The drafters obviously contemplated that&para;<br>some removals might be in violation of the law of the&para;<br>child’s home nation, but not “wrongful” within the mean­&para;<br>ing of the Convention—i.e., not in breach of “rights of&para;<br>custody.” This is precisely why Article 5 carefully deline­&para;<br>ates between the two types of parental rights in the first&para;<br>place. And this is precisely why Article 21 exists.&para;<br>Nevertheless, the Court has now decreed that whenever&para;<br>an award of visitation rights triggers a statutory default&para;<br>travel restriction provision, or is accompanied by a travel&para;<br>restriction by judicial order, a parent possess a right of&para;<br>custody within the meaning of the Convention. Such a&para;<br>bright-line rule surely will not serve the best interests of&para;<br>the child in many cases. See Pérez-Vera Report ¶25, at&para;<br>432. It will also have surprising results. In Chile, for&para;<br>example, as a result of this Court’s decision, all parents—&para;<br>so long as they have the barest of visitation rights—now&para;<br>also have joint custody within the meaning of the Conven­&para;<br>tion and the right to utilize the return remedy.10&para;<br>It bears emphasis that such a result—treating the type&para;<br>——————&para;<br>10 In 2003, the latest year for which statistics appear available,&para;<br>Chile’s Central Authority, which is the entity responsible for adminis­&para;<br>tering its obligations under the Hague Convention, made five outgoing&para;<br>“access applications” under Article 21.

I find it quite&para;<br>unlikely, in light of its framing of the “fundamental purpose” of the&para;<br>Convention, that the State Department would have agreed at the time&para;<br>that a removal was “wrongful” within the meaning of the Convention&para;<br>when a parent with physical custody of a child took that child to an­&para;<br>other country, even when that removal was in violation of a restriction&para;<br>on the custodial parent’s travel rights. See also Brief for Eleven Law&para;<br>Professors as Amici Curiae 4–5, n. 7. Even more telling, however, is&para;<br>the fact that, in a response to a questionnaire used by the Convention’s&para;<br>drafters in preparing the treaty, the United States characterized a&para;<br>ne exeat right as one with “the purpose of preserving the jurisdiction of&para;<br>the state in the custody matter and of safeguarding the visitation rights&para;<br>of the other parent.” 1980 Conférence de La Haye de droit interna­&para;<br>tional privé, Enlèvement d’enfants, Replies of the Governments to the&para;<br>Questionnaire, in 3 Actes et Documents de la Quatorzième session, pp.&para;<br>85, 88 (1982).

S. 447, 468&para;<br>(1913) (affording “much weight” to the fact that the&para;<br>“United States has always construed its obligation” under&para;<br>a treaty in a particular way and had acted in accord).&para;<br>Instead, the Department offers us little more than its&para;<br>——————&para;<br>13 This only underscores what seems quite clear: Whatever contempo­&para;<br>rary international consensus the Court claims has now emerged, “that&para;<br>view was not generally formulated when the Convention was drafted in&para;<br>1980.” Ante, at 14. I understand the Court’s reference to contemporary&para;<br>consensus to depend on the views of contemporary scholars and indi­&para;<br>vidual signatory states developed postratification, including the views&para;<br>of the Special Commission, a voluntary post hac collective body with no&para;<br>treaty-making authority, see ibid. Even assuming that the Court is&para;<br>correct that consensus has emerged after the Convention was written&para;<br>and ratified that ne exeat rights should be “rights of custody,” in my&para;<br>view this provides no support at all for the position that the Conven­&para;<br>tion’s drafters had these types of rights in mind and intended for the&para;<br>Convention to treat them as rights of custody. To the contrary, I think&para;<br>it tends to prove the opposite point.&para;<br>14 This is somewhat surprising given that in 1999 the Department&para;<br>made 212 outgoing applications for return of children to the United&para;<br>States and made 85 such requests in 2003. Lowe Analysis 479.&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. ABBOTT&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>own reading of the treaty’s text. Its view is informed by no&para;<br>unique vantage it has, whether as the entity responsible&para;<br>for enforcing the Convention in this country or as a par­&para;<br>ticipating drafter. The Court’s perfunctory, one-paragraph&para;<br>treatment of the Department’s judgment of this matter&para;<br>only underscores this point. Ante, at 11–12. I see no&para;<br>reason, therefore, to replace our understanding of the&para;<br>Convention’s text with that of the Executive Branch.&para;<br>Views of foreign jurisdictions. The Court believes that&para;<br>the views of our sister signatories to the Convention de­&para;<br>serve special attention when, in a case like this, “Congress&para;<br>has directed that ‘uniform international interpretation’ of&para;<br>the Convention is part of the Convention’s framework.”&para;<br>Ante, at 12 (quoting 42 U. S. C. §11601(b)(3)(B)). This&para;<br>may well be correct, but we should not substitute the&para;<br>judgment of other courts for our own. See Olympic Air­&para;<br>ways v. Husain, 540 U. S. 644, 655, n. 9 (2004). And the&para;<br>handful of foreign decisions the Court cites, see ante, at&para;<br>12–13, provide insufficient reason to depart from my&para;<br>understanding of the meaning of the Convention, an un­&para;<br>derstanding shared by many U. S. Courts of Appeals. See,&para;<br>e.g., 542 F. 3d 1081 (CA5 2008) (case below); Gonzalez v.&para;<br>Gutierrez, 311 F. 3d 942, 949 (CA9 2002) (parent’s right to&para;<br>“refuse permission for his children to leave Mexico”&para;<br>“hardly amounts to a right of custody, in the plainest&para;<br>sense of the term”); Croll, 229 F. 3d, at 140 (“If we were to&para;<br>enforce rights held pursuant to a ne exeat clause by the&para;<br>remedy of mandatory return, the Convention would be­&para;<br>come unworkable. . . . It does not contemplate return of a&para;<br>child to a parent whose sole right—to visit or veto—impose&para;<br>no duty to give care”); Fawcett v. McRoberts, 326 F. 3d 491&para;<br>(CA4 2003). Indeed, the interest in having our courts&para;<br>correctly interpret the Convention may outweigh the&para;<br>interest in having the ne exeat clause issue resolved in the&para;<br>same way that it is resolved in other countries. Cf. Breard&para;<br>v. Greene, 523 U. S. 371, 375 (1998) (per curiam) (“[W]hile&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 560 U.

The various&para;<br>decisions of the international courts are, at best, in equi­&para;<br>poise. Indeed, the Court recognizes that courts in Canada&para;<br>and France have concluded that travel restrictions are not&para;<br>“rights of custody” within the meaning of the Convention.&para;<br>Ante, at 13–14.&para;<br>And those decisions supportive of the Court’s position do&para;<br>not offer nearly as much support as first meets the eye.&para;<br>For example, the English High Court of Justice decision&para;<br>on which the Court primarily relies, ante, at 12, appears to&para;<br>have decided a different issue. True, that court considered&para;<br>the effect of a similar travel restriction on both parents&para;<br>following the award of “custody” to the child’s mother. C.&para;<br>v. C., [1989] 1 W. L. R. 654, 656 (C. A.). But the family&para;<br>court had also decreed, at the time it awarded “custody” to&para;<br>the mother, that both parents would remain “ ‘joint guardi­&para;<br>ans’ ” of the child. Ibid. Moreover, in the time between&para;<br>the mother’s removal of the child and the father’s petition­&para;<br>ing for his return, the father had returned to the Family&para;<br>Court in Sydney, obtained an order for the child’s return,&para;<br>and received immediate custody of the child. Ibid. Com­&para;<br>parable facts do not exist in this case. Cf. Olympic Air­&para;<br>ways, 540 U. S., at 655, n. 9 (noting that “we are hesitant”&para;<br>to follow decisions of sister signatory courts when “there&para;<br>are substantial factual distinctions between” the cases).&para;<br>&para;<br>24&para;<br>&para;<br>ABBOTT v. ABBOTT&para;<br>STEVENS, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>Similar factual distinctions—involving, typically, joint&para;<br>guardianship rights or shared decisionmaking rights—are&para;<br>present in other of the foreign cases relied upon by the&para;<br>Court and Mr. Abbott.15&para;<br>Those foreign courts that have reached a position con­&para;<br>sistent with my own, the Court is right to point out, have&para;<br>also done so in slightly different factual scenarios. Ante,&para;<br>at 13–14. The Supreme Court of Canada, for example,&para;<br>first encountered a ne exeat provision as part of an interim&para;<br>custody order in Thomson v. Thomson, [1994] 3 S. C. R.&para;<br>551, 589–590, 119 D. L. R. (4th) 253, 281. Although the&para;<br>Canadian high court concluded that a removal in breach of&para;<br>the temporary travel restriction was wrongful, it empha­&para;<br>sized the interim nature of the provision, see n. 9, supra,&para;<br>and explained that the case would be different with a&para;<br>permanent order.
