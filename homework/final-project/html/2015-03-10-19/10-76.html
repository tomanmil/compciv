BROWN ET UX., CO-ADMINISTRATORS OF&para;<br>&para;<br>THE ESTATE OF BROWN, ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF NORTH CAROLINA&para;<br>No. 10–76. Argued January 11, 2011 —Decided June 27, 2011&para;<br>Respondents, North Carolina residents whose sons died in a bus acci&para;<br>dent outside Paris, France, filed a suit for wrongful-death damages in&para;<br>North Carolina state court. Alleging that the accident was caused by&para;<br>tire failure, they named as defendants Goodyear USA, an Ohio corpo&para;<br>ration, and petitioners, three Goodyear USA subsidiaries, organized&para;<br>and operating, respectively, in Luxembourg, Turkey, and France. Pe&para;<br>titioners’ tires are manufactured primarily for European and Asian&para;<br>markets and differ in size and construction from tires ordinarily sold&para;<br>in the United States. Petitioners are not registered to do business in&para;<br>North Carolina; have no place of business, employees, or bank ac&para;<br>counts in the State; do not design, manufacture, or advertise their&para;<br>products in the State; and do not solicit business in the State or sell&para;<br>or ship tires to North Carolina customers. Even so, a small percent&para;<br>age of their tires were distributed in North Carolina by other Good&para;<br>year USA affiliates. The trial court denied petitioners’ motion to&para;<br>dismiss the claims against them for want of personal jurisdiction.&para;<br>The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the&para;<br>North Carolina courts had general jurisdiction over petitioners,&para;<br>whose tires had reached the State through “the stream of commerce.”&para;<br>Held: Petitioners were not amenable to suit in North Carolina on&para;<br>claims unrelated to any activity of petitioners in the forum State.&para;<br>Pp. 6–14.&para;<br>(a) The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause sets the&para;<br>outer boundaries of a state tribunal’s authority to proceed against a&para;<br>defendant. The pathmarking decision of International Shoe Co. v.&para;<br>Washington, 326 U. S. 310, provides that state courts may exercise&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S. A.&para;<br>v. BROWN&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant who has “certain&para;<br>minimum contacts with [the State] such that the maintenance of the&para;<br>suit does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial&para;<br>justice.’ ” Id., at 316. Endeavoring to give specific content to the “fair&para;<br>play and substantial justice” concept, the Court in International Shoe&para;<br>classified cases involving out-of-state corporate defendants. First,&para;<br>the Court recognized that jurisdiction could be asserted where the&para;<br>corporation’s in-state activity is “continuous and systematic” and&para;<br>gave rise to the episode-in-suit. Id., at 317. It also observed that the&para;<br>commission of “single or occasional acts” in a State may be sufficient&para;<br>to render a corporation answerable in that State with respect to those&para;<br>acts, though not with respect to matters unrelated to the forum con&para;<br>nections. Id., at 318. These two categories compose what is now&para;<br>known as “specific jurisdiction.” Helicopteros Nacionales de Colom&para;<br>bia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408, 414, n. 8. International Shoe distin&para;<br>guished from cases that fit within the “specific jurisdiction” catego&para;<br>ries, “instances in which the continuous corporate operations within a&para;<br>state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit&para;<br>against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct&para;<br>from those activities.” 326 U. S., at 318. Adjudicatory authority so&para;<br>grounded is now called “general jurisdiction.” Helicopteros, 466 U. S.,&para;<br>at 414, n. 9. Since International Shoe, this Court’s decisions have&para;<br>elaborated primarily on circumstances that warrant the exercise of&para;<br>specific jurisdiction. In only two decisions postdating International&para;<br>Shoe has this Court considered whether an out-of-state corporate de&para;<br>fendant’s in-state contacts were sufficiently “continuous and system&para;<br>atic” to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over claims unre&para;<br>lated to those contacts: Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342&para;<br>U. S. 437; and Helicopteros, 466 U. S. 408. Pp. 6–9.&para;<br>(b) Petitioners lack “the kind of continuous and systematic general&para;<br>business contacts” necessary to allow North Carolina to entertain a&para;<br>suit against them unrelated to anything that connects them to the&para;<br>State. Helicopteros, 466 U. S., at 416. The stream-of-commerce cases&para;<br>on which the North Carolina court relied relate to exercises of specific&para;<br>jurisdiction in products liability actions, in which a nonresident de&para;<br>fendant, acting outside the forum, places in the stream of commerce a&para;<br>product that ultimately causes harm inside the forum. Many state&para;<br>long-arm statutes authorize courts to exercise specific jurisdiction&para;<br>over manufacturers when the events in suit, or some of them, oc&para;<br>curred within the forum State. The North Carolina court’s stream-of&para;<br>commerce analysis elided the essential difference between case&para;<br>specific and general jurisdiction. Flow of a manufacturer’s products&para;<br>into the forum may bolster an affiliation germane to specific jurisdic&para;<br>tion, see, e.g., World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>286, 297; but ties serving to bolster the exercise of specific jurisdic&para;<br>tion do not warrant a determination that, based on those ties, the fo&para;<br>rum has general jurisdiction over a defendant. A corporation’s “con&para;<br>tinuous activity of some sorts within a state,” International Shoe&para;<br>instructed, “is not enough to support the demand that the corporation&para;<br>be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity.” 326 U. S., at 318.&para;<br>Measured against Helicopteros and Perkins, North Carolina is not&para;<br>a forum in which it would be permissible to subject petitioners to&para;<br>general jurisdiction. In the 1952 Perkins case, general jurisdiction&para;<br>was appropriately exercised over a Philippine corporation sued in&para;<br>Ohio, where the company’s affairs were overseen during World War&para;<br>II. In Helicopteros, however, the survivors of U. S. citizens killed&para;<br>when a helicopter owned by a Colombian corporation crashed in Peru&para;<br>could not maintain wrongful-death actions against that corporation&para;<br>in Texas, where the company’s contacts “consisted of sending its chief&para;<br>executive officer to Houston for a contract-negotiation session; accept&para;<br>ing into its New York bank account checks drawn on a Houston bank;&para;<br>purchasing helicopters, equipment, and training services from [a&para;<br>Texas enterprise]; and sending personnel to [Texas] for training.”&para;<br>466 U. S., at 416. These links to Texas did not “constitute the kind of&para;<br>continuous and systematic general business contacts . . . found to ex&para;<br>ist in Perkins,” and were insufficient to support the exercise of juris&para;<br>diction over a claim that neither “ ‘ar[o]se out of’ . . . no[r] related to”&para;<br>the defendant’s activities in Texas. Id., at 415–416. This Court sees&para;<br>no reason to differentiate from the ties to Texas held insufficient in&para;<br>Helicopteros, the sales of petitioners’ tires sporadically made in North&para;<br>Carolina through intermediaries. Pp. 9–13.&para;<br>(c) Neither below nor in their brief in opposition to the petition for&para;<br>certiorari did respondents urge disregard of petitioners’ discrete&para;<br>status as subsidiaries and treatment of all Goodyear entities as a&para;<br>“unitary business,” so that jurisdiction over the parent would draw in&para;<br>the subsidiaries as well. Respondents have therefore forfeited this&para;<br>contention. Pp. 13–14.&para;<br>199 N. C. App. 50, 681 S.

International Shoe&para;<br>Co. v. Washington, 326 U.

Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall,&para;<br>466 U.

See Interna&para;<br>tional Shoe, 326 U. S., at 317. Specific jurisdiction, on the&para;<br>other hand, depends on an “affiliatio[n] between the forum&para;<br>and the underlying controversy,” principally, activity or an&para;<br>occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is&para;<br>therefore subject to the State’s regulation. von Mehren &amp;&para;<br>Trautman, Jurisdiction to Adjudicate: A Suggested Analy&para;<br>sis, 79 Harv.

Were the foreign subsidiaries nonetheless&para;<br>amenable to general jurisdiction in North Carolina courts?&para;<br>Confusing or blending general and specific jurisdictional&para;<br>inquiries, the North Carolina courts answered yes. Some&para;<br>of the tires made abroad by Goodyear’s foreign subsidiar&para;<br>ies, the North Carolina Court of Appeals stressed, had&para;<br>reached North Carolina through “the stream of com&para;<br>merce”; that connection, the Court of Appeals believed,&para;<br>gave North Carolina courts the handle needed for the&para;<br>exercise of general jurisdiction over the foreign corpora&para;<br>tions. Id., at 67–68, 681 S.

(Goodyear Turkey),&para;<br>and Goodyear Dunlop Tires France, SA (Goodyear&para;<br>France), petitioners here, were named as defendants.&para;<br>Incorporated in Luxembourg, Turkey, and France, respec&para;<br>tively, petitioners are indirect subsidiaries of Goodyear&para;<br>USA, an Ohio corporation also named as a defendant in&para;<br>the suit. Petitioners manufacture tires primarily for sale&para;<br>in European and Asian markets. Their tires differ in size&para;<br>and construction from tires ordinarily sold in the United&para;<br>States. They are designed to carry significantly heavier&para;<br>loads, and to serve under road conditions and speed limits&para;<br>in the manufacturers’ primary markets.1&para;<br>In contrast to the parent company, Goodyear USA,&para;<br>which does not contest the North Carolina courts’ personal&para;<br>jurisdiction over it, petitioners are not registered to do&para;<br>business in North Carolina. They have no place of busi&para;<br>ness, employees, or bank accounts in North Carolina.&para;<br>They do not design, manufacture, or advertise their prod&para;<br>ucts in North Carolina. And they do not solicit business in&para;<br>North Carolina or themselves sell or ship tires to North&para;<br>Carolina customers. Even so, a small percentage of peti&para;<br>tioners’ tires (tens of thousands out of tens of millions&para;<br>manufactured between 2004 and 2007) were distributed&para;<br>within North Carolina by other Goodyear USA affiliates.&para;<br>These tires were typically custom ordered to equip special&para;<br>ized vehicles such as cement mixers, waste haulers, and&para;<br>boat and horse trailers. Petitioners state, and respondents&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Respondents portray Goodyear USA’s structure as a reprehensible&para;<br>effort to “outsource” all manufacturing, and correspondingly, tort&para;<br>litigation, to foreign jurisdictions. See Brief for Respondents 51–53.&para;<br>Yet Turkey, where the tire alleged to have caused the accident-in-suit&para;<br>was made, is hardly a strange location for a facility that primarily&para;<br>supplies markets in Europe and Asia.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

The trial court denied&para;<br>the motion, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals af&para;<br>firmed. Acknowledging that the claims neither “related&para;<br>to, nor . . . ar[o]se from, [petitioners’] contacts with North&para;<br>Carolina,” the Court of Appeals confined its analysis to&para;<br>“general rather than specific jurisdiction,” which the court&para;<br>recognized required a “higher threshold” showing: A de&para;<br>fendant must have “continuous and systematic contacts”&para;<br>with the forum. Id., at 58, 681 S. E. 2d, at 388 (internal&para;<br>quotation marks omitted). That threshold was crossed,&para;<br>the court determined, when petitioners placed their tires&para;<br>“in the stream of interstate commerce without any limita&para;<br>tion on the extent to which those tires could be sold in&para;<br>North Carolina.” Id., at 67, 681 S. E. 2d, at 394.&para;<br>Nothing in the record, the court observed, indicated&para;<br>that petitioners “took any affirmative action to cause tires&para;<br>which they had manufactured to be shipped into North&para;<br>Carolina.” Id., at 64, 681 S. E. 2d, at 392. The court&para;<br>found, however, that tires made by petitioners reached&para;<br>North Carolina as a consequence of a “highly-organized&para;<br>distribution process” involving other Goodyear USA sub&para;<br>sidiaries. Id., at 67, 681 S. E. 2d, at 394. Petitioners, the&para;<br>court noted, made “no attempt to keep these tires from&para;<br>reaching the North Carolina market.” Id., at 66, 681 S. E.&para;<br>2d, at 393. Indeed, the very tire involved in the accident,&para;<br>the court observed, conformed to tire standards estab&para;<br>lished by the U. S. Department of Transportation and bore&para;<br>markings required for sale in the United States. Ibid.2 As&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 Such markings do not necessarily show that any of the tires were&para;<br>destined for sale in the United States.

S., at 463).&para;<br>Endeavoring to give specific content to the “fair play and&para;<br>substantial justice” concept, the Court in International&para;<br>Shoe classified cases involving out-of-state corporate&para;<br>defendants. First, as in International Shoe itself, jurisdic&para;<br>tion unquestionably could be asserted where the corpora&para;<br>——————&para;<br>General explained, the United States encourages other countries to&para;<br>“treat compliance with [Department of Transportation] standards, in&para;<br>cluding through use of DOT markings, as evidence that the products&para;<br>are safely manufactured.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 32.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

Further, the Court observed, the commission of&para;<br>certain “single or occasional acts” in a State may be suffi&para;<br>cient to render a corporation answerable in that State&para;<br>with respect to those acts, though not with respect to&para;<br>matters unrelated to the forum connections. Id., at 318.&para;<br>The heading courts today use to encompass these two&para;<br>International Shoe categories is “specific jurisdiction.” See&para;<br>von Mehren &amp; Trautman 1144–1163. Adjudicatory au&para;<br>thority is “specific” when the suit “aris[es] out of or relate[s]&para;<br>to the defendant’s contacts with the forum.” Helicopteros,&para;<br>466 U. S., at 414, n. 8.&para;<br>International Shoe distinguished from cases that fit&para;<br>within the “specific jurisdiction” categories, “instances in&para;<br>which the continuous corporate operations within a state&para;<br>[are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit&para;<br>against it on causes of action arising from dealings en&para;<br>tirely distinct from those activities.” 326 U. S., at 318.&para;<br>Adjudicatory authority so grounded is today called “gen&para;<br>eral jurisdiction.” Helicopteros, 466 U. S., at 414, n. 9. For&para;<br>an individual, the paradigm forum for the exercise of&para;<br>general jurisdiction is the individual’s domicile; for a&para;<br>corporation, it is an equivalent place, one in which the&para;<br>corporation is fairly regarded as at home. See Brilmayer&para;<br>728 (identifying domicile, place of incorporation, and&para;<br>principal place of business as “paradig[m]” bases for the&para;<br>exercise of general jurisdiction).&para;<br>Since International Shoe, this Court’s decisions have&para;<br>elaborated primarily on circumstances that warrant the&para;<br>exercise of specific jurisdiction, particularly in cases in&para;<br>volving “single or occasional acts” occurring or having&para;<br>their impact within the forum State. As a rule in these&para;<br>cases, this Court has inquired whether there was “some&para;<br>act by which the defendant purposefully avail[ed] itself of&para;<br>the privilege of conducting activities within the forum&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S.

The stream-of-commerce metaphor has&para;<br>been invoked frequently in lower court decisions permit&para;<br>ting “jurisdiction in products liability cases in which the&para;<br>product has traveled through an extensive chain of distri&para;<br>bution before reaching the ultimate consumer.” 18 W.&para;<br>Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations §8640.40,&para;<br>p. 133 (rev. ed. 2007). Typically, in such cases, a nonresi&para;<br>dent defendant, acting outside the forum, places in the&para;<br>stream of commerce a product that ultimately causes&para;<br>harm inside the forum. See generally Dayton, Personal&para;<br>Jurisdiction and the Stream of Commerce, 7 Rev. Litiga&para;<br>tion 239, 262–268 (1988) (discussing origins and evolution&para;<br>of the stream-of-commerce doctrine).&para;<br>Many States have enacted long-arm statutes authoriz&para;<br>ing courts to exercise specific jurisdiction over manufac&para;<br>turers when the events in suit, or some of them, occurred&para;<br>within the forum state. For example, the “Local Injury;&para;<br>Foreign Act” subsection of North Carolina’s long-arm&para;<br>statute authorizes North Carolina courts to exercise per&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S. A.&para;<br>v. BROWN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>sonal jurisdiction in “any action claiming injury to person&para;<br>or property within this State arising out of [the defen&para;<br>dant’s] act or omission outside this State,” if, “in addi&para;<br>tion[,] at or about the time of the injury,” ”[p]roducts . . .&para;<br>manufactured by the defendant were used or consumed,&para;<br>within this State in the ordinary course of trade.” N. C.&para;<br>Gen. Stat. Ann. §1–75.4(4)(b) (Lexis 2009).3 As the North&para;<br>Carolina Court of Appeals recognized, this provision of the&para;<br>State’s long-arm statute “does not apply to this case,” for&para;<br>both the act alleged to have caused injury (the fabrication&para;<br>of the allegedly defective tire) and its impact (the accident)&para;<br>occurred outside the forum. See 199 N. C. App., at 61,&para;<br>n. 6, 681 S. E. 2d, at 390, n. 6.4&para;<br>The North Carolina court’s stream-of-commerce analysis&para;<br>elided the essential difference between case-specific and&para;<br>all-purpose (general) jurisdiction. Flow of a manufac&para;<br>turer’s products into the forum, we have explained, may&para;<br>bolster an affiliation germane to specific jurisdiction. See,&para;<br>e.g., World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U. S., at 297 (where “the&para;<br>sale of a product . . . is not simply an isolated occurrence,&para;<br>but arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distribu&para;<br>tor to serve . . . the market for its product in [several]&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Cf. D. C. Code §13–423(a)(4) (2001) (providing for specific jurisdic&para;<br>tion over defendant who “caus[es] tortious injury in the [forum] by an&para;<br>act or omission outside the [forum]” when, in addition, the defendant&para;<br>“derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed . . . in the&para;<br>[forum]”).&para;<br>4 The court instead relied on N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §1–75.4(1)(d), see&para;<br>199 N. C. App., at 57, 681 S. E. 2d, at 388, which provides for jurisdic&para;<br>tion, “whether the claim arises within or without [the] State,” when the&para;<br>defendant “[i]s engaged in substantial activity within this State,&para;<br>whether such activity is wholly interstate, intrastate, or otherwise.”&para;<br>This provision, the North Carolina Supreme Court has held, was “in&para;<br>tended to make available to the North Carolina courts the full juris&para;<br>dictional powers permissible under federal due process.” Dillon v.&para;<br>Numismatic Funding Corp., 291 N. C. 674, 676, 231 S. E. 2d 629, 630&para;<br>(1977).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

But ties serving to bolster the exercise&para;<br>of specific jurisdiction do not warrant a determination&para;<br>that, based on those ties, the forum has general jurisdic&para;<br>tion over a defendant. See, e.g., Stabilisierungsfonds Fur&para;<br>Wein v. Kaiser Stuhl Wine Distributors Pty. Ltd., 647 F. 2d&para;<br>200, 203, n. 5 (CADC 1981) (defendants’ marketing ar&para;<br>rangements, although “adequate to permit litigation of&para;<br>claims relating to [their] introduction of . . . wine into&para;<br>the United States stream of commerce, . . . would not be&para;<br>adequate to support general, ‘all purpose’ adjudicatory&para;<br>authority”).&para;<br>A corporation’s “continuous activity of some sorts within&para;<br>a state,” International Shoe instructed, “is not enough to&para;<br>support the demand that the corporation be amenable to&para;<br>suits unrelated to that activity.” 326 U. S., at 318. Our&para;<br>1952 decision in Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co.&para;<br>remains “[t]he textbook case of general jurisdiction appro&para;<br>priately exercised over a foreign corporation that has not&para;<br>consented to suit in the forum.” Donahue v. Far Eastern&para;<br>Air Transport Corp., 652 F. 2d 1032, 1037 (CADC 1981).&para;<br>Sued in Ohio, the defendant in Perkins was a Philippine&para;<br>mining corporation that had ceased activities in the Phil&para;<br>ippines during World War II. To the extent that the com&para;<br>pany was conducting any business during and immedi&para;<br>ately after the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, it&para;<br>was doing so in Ohio: the corporation’s president main&para;<br>tained his office there, kept the company files in that&para;<br>office, and supervised from the Ohio office “the necessarily&para;<br>limited wartime activities of the company.” Perkins, 342&para;<br>U. S., at 447–448. Although the claim-in-suit did not arise&para;<br>in Ohio, this Court ruled that it would not violate due&para;<br>process for Ohio to adjudicate the controversy. Ibid.; see&para;<br>Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U. S. 770, 779–780,&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S. A.&para;<br>v. BROWN&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>n. 11 (1984) (Ohio’s exercise of general jurisdiction was&para;<br>permissible in Perkins because “Ohio was the corporation’s&para;<br>principal, if temporary, place of business”).&para;<br>We next addressed the exercise of general jurisdiction&para;<br>over an out-of-state corporation over three decades later,&para;<br>in Helicopteros. In that case, survivors of United States&para;<br>citizens who died in a helicopter crash in Peru instituted&para;<br>wrongful-death actions in a Texas state court against the&para;<br>owner and operator of the helicopter, a Colombian corpo&para;<br>ration. The Colombian corporation had no place of busi&para;<br>ness in Texas and was not licensed to do business there.&para;<br>“Basically, [the company’s] contacts with Texas consisted&para;<br>of sending its chief executive officer to Houston for a&para;<br>contract-negotiation session; accepting into its New York&para;<br>bank account checks drawn on a Houston bank; purchas&para;<br>ing helicopters, equipment, and training services from [a&para;<br>Texas enterprise] for substantial sums; and sending per&para;<br>sonnel to [Texas] for training.” 466 U. S., at 416. These&para;<br>links to Texas, we determined, did not “constitute the kind&para;<br>of continuous and systematic general business contacts . . .&para;<br>found to exist in Perkins,” and were insufficient to support&para;<br>the exercise of jurisdiction over a claim that neither&para;<br>“ar[o]se out of . . . no[r] related to” the defendant’s activi&para;<br>ties in Texas. Id., at 415–416 (internal quotation marks&para;<br>omitted).&para;<br>Helicopteros concluded that “mere purchases [made in&para;<br>the forum State], even if occurring at regular intervals,&para;<br>are not enough to warrant a State’s assertion of [general]&para;<br>jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation in a cause of&para;<br>action not related to those purchase transactions.” Id., at&para;<br>418. We see no reason to differentiate from the ties to&para;<br>Texas held insufficient in Helicopteros, the sales of peti&para;<br>tioners’ tires sporadically made in North Carolina through&para;<br>intermediaries. Under the sprawling view of general&para;<br>jurisdiction urged by respondents and embraced by the&para;<br>North Carolina Court of Appeals, any substantial manu&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 564 U.

World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U. S., at 296 (every&para;<br>seller of chattels does not, by virtue of the sale, “appoint&para;<br>the chattel his agent for service of process”).&para;<br>Measured against Helicopteros and Perkins, North Caro&para;<br>lina is not a forum in which it would be permissible to&para;<br>subject petitioners to general jurisdiction. Unlike the&para;<br>defendant in Perkins, whose sole wartime business activ&para;<br>ity was conducted in Ohio, petitioners are in no sense at&para;<br>home in North Carolina. Their attenuated connections to&para;<br>the State, see supra, at 4–5, fall far short of the “the con&para;<br>tinuous and systematic general business contacts” neces&para;<br>sary to empower North Carolina to entertain suit against&para;<br>them on claims unrelated to anything that connects them&para;<br>to the State. Helicopteros, 466 U. S., at 416.5&para;<br>C&para;<br>Respondents belatedly assert a “single enterprise” the&para;<br>ory, asking us to consolidate petitioners’ ties to North&para;<br>Carolina with those of Goodyear USA and other Goodyear&para;<br>entities. See Brief for Respondents 44–50. In effect,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 As earlier noted, see supra, at 6, the North Carolina Court of Ap&para;<br>peals invoked the State’s “well-recognized interest in providing a forum&para;<br>in which its citizens are able to seek redress for injuries that they have&para;<br>sustained.” 199 N. C. App., at 68, 681 S. E. 2d, at 394. But “[g]eneral&para;<br>jurisdiction to adjudicate has in [United States] practice never been&para;<br>based on the plaintiff’s relationship to the forum. There is nothing in&para;<br>[our] law comparable to . . . article 14 of the Civil Code of France (1804)&para;<br>under which the French nationality of the plaintiff is a sufficient&para;<br>ground for jurisdiction.” von Mehren &amp; Trautman 1137; see Clermont&para;<br>&amp; Palmer, Exorbitant Jurisdiction, 58 Me. L. Rev. 474, 492–495 (2006)&para;<br>(French law permitting plaintiff-based jurisdiction is rarely invoked&para;<br>in the absence of other supporting factors). When a defendant’s act&para;<br>outside the forum causes injury in the forum, by contrast, a plaintiff’s&para;<br>residence in the forum may strengthen the case for the exercise of&para;<br>specific jurisdiction. See Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S. 783, 788 (1984); von&para;<br>Mehren &amp; Trautman 1167–1173.&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>GOODYEAR DUNLOP TIRES OPERATIONS, S. A.&para;<br>v.

But see 199 N. C. App., at 64, 681 S.
