S. C. §207(a), but this requirement&para;<br>does not apply with respect to workers employed “in the capacity of&para;<br>outside salesman,” §213(a)(1). Congress did not elaborate on the&para;<br>meaning of “outside salesman,” but it delegated authority to the Department of Labor (DOL) to issue regulations to define the term.&para;<br>Three of the DOL’s regulations are relevant to this case. First, 29&para;<br>CFR §541.500 defines “outside salesman” to mean “any employee . . .&para;<br>[w]hose primary duty is . . . making sales within the meaning of [29&para;<br>U. S. C. §203(k)].” §§541.500(a)(1)(2). Section 203(k), in turn, states&para;<br>that “ ‘[s]ale’ or ‘sell’ includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell,&para;<br>consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.” Second, §541.501 clarifies that “[s]ales within the meaning of [§203(k)]&para;<br>include the transfer of title to tangible property.” §541.501(b). Third,&para;<br>§541.503 provides that promotion work that is “performed incidental&para;<br>to and in conjunction with an employee’s own outside sales or solicitations is exempt work,” whereas promotion work that is “incidental&para;<br>to sales made, or to be made, by someone else is not.” §541.503(a).&para;<br>The DOL provided additional guidance in connection with its promulgation of these regulations, stressing that an employee is an “outside salesman” when the employee “in some sense, has made sales.”&para;<br>69 Fed. Reg. 22162.&para;<br>The prescription drug industry is subject to extensive federal regulation, including the requirement that prescription drugs be dispensed only upon a physician’s prescription. In light of this requirement, pharmaceutical companies have long focused their direct&para;<br>marketing efforts on physicians. Pharmaceutical companies promote&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>their products to physicians through a process called “detailing,”&para;<br>whereby employees known as “detailers” or “pharmaceutical sales&para;<br>representatives” try to persuade physicians to write prescriptions for&para;<br>the products in appropriate cases.&para;<br>Petitioners were employed by respondent as pharmaceutical sales&para;<br>representatives for roughly four years, and during that time their&para;<br>primary objective was to obtain a nonbinding commitment from physicians to prescribe respondent’s products in appropriate cases. Each&para;<br>week, petitioners spent about 40 hours in the field calling on physicians during normal business hours and an additional 10 to 20 hours&para;<br>attending events and performing other miscellaneous tasks. Petitioners were not required to punch a clock or report their hours, and&para;<br>they were subject to only minimal supervision. Petitioners were well&para;<br>compensated for their efforts, and their gross pay included both a&para;<br>base salary and incentive pay. The amount of incentive pay was determined based on the performance of petitioners’ assigned portfolio&para;<br>of drugs in their assigned sales territories. It is undisputed that petitioners were not paid time-and-a-half wages when they worked more&para;<br>than 40 hours per week.&para;<br>Petitioners filed suit, alleging that respondent violated the FLSA&para;<br>by failing to compensate them for overtime. Respondent moved for&para;<br>summary judgment, arguing that petitioners were “employed in the&para;<br>capacity of outside salesman,” §213(a)(1), and therefore were exempt&para;<br>from the FLSA’s overtime compensation requirement. The District&para;<br>Court agreed and granted summary judgment to respondent. Petitioners filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, contending&para;<br>that the District Court had erred in failing to accord controlling deference to the DOL’s interpretation of the pertinent regulations, which&para;<br>the DOL had announced in an amicus brief filed in a similar action.&para;<br>The District Court rejected this argument and denied the motion.&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit, agreeing that the DOL’s interpretation was not&para;<br>entitled to controlling deference, affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: Petitioners qualify as outside salesmen under the most reasonable interpretation of the DOL’s regulations. Pp. 8–25.&para;<br>(a) The DOL filed amicus briefs in the Second Circuit and the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit in which it took the view that “a ‘sale’ for the purposes&para;<br>of the outside sales exemption requires a consummated transaction&para;<br>directly involving the employee for whom the exemption is sought.”&para;<br>Brief for Secretary of Labor as Amicus Curiae in In re Novartis Wage&para;<br>and Hour Litigation, No. 09–0437 (CA2), p. 11. The DOL changed&para;<br>course after the Court granted certiorari in this case, however, and&para;<br>now maintains that “[a]n employee does not make a ‘sale’ . . . unless&para;<br>he actually transfers title to the property at issue.” Brief for United&para;<br>States as Amicus Curiae 1213. The DOL’s current interpretation of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>its regulations is not entitled to deference under Auer v. Robbins, 519&para;<br>U. S. 452. Although Auer ordinarily calls for deference to an agency’s&para;<br>interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation, even when that interpretation is advanced in a legal brief, see, id., at 461462, this&para;<br>general rule does not apply in all cases. Deference is inappropriate,&para;<br>for example, when the agency’s interpretation is “ ‘plainly erroneous&para;<br>or inconsistent with the regulation,’ ” id., at 461, or when there is&para;<br>reason to suspect that the interpretation “does not reflect the agency’s fair and considered judgment on the matter,” id., at 462. There&para;<br>are strong reasons for withholding Auer deference in this case. Petitioners invoke the DOL’s interpretation to impose potentially massive liability on respondent for conduct that occurred well before the&para;<br>interpretation was announced. To defer to the DOL’s interpretation&para;<br>would result in precisely the kind of “unfair surprise” against which&para;<br>this Court has long warned. See, e.g., Long Island Care at Home,&para;<br>Ltd. v. Coke, 551 U. S. 158, 170171. Until 2009, the pharmaceutical&para;<br>industry had little reason to suspect that its longstanding practice of&para;<br>treating detailers as exempt outside salesmen transgressed the&para;<br>FLSA. The statute and regulations do not provide clear notice. Even&para;<br>more important, despite the industry’s decades-long practice, the&para;<br>DOL never initiated any enforcement actions with respect to detailers or otherwise suggested that it thought the industry was acting&para;<br>unlawfully. The only plausible explanation for the DOL’s inaction is&para;<br>acquiescence. Whatever the general merits of Auer deference, it is&para;<br>unwarranted here. The DOL’s interpretation should instead be given&para;<br>a measure of deference proportional to its power to persuade. See&para;<br>United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 228. Pp. 8–14.&para;<br>(b) The DOL’s current interpretation—that a sale demands a transfer of title—is quite unpersuasive. It plainly lacks the hallmarks of&para;<br>thorough consideration. Because the DOL first announced its view&para;<br>that pharmaceutical sales representatives are not outside salesmen&para;<br>in a series of amicus briefs, there was no opportunity for public comment, and the interpretation that initially emerged from the DOL’s&para;<br>internal decisionmaking process proved to be untenable. The interpretation is also flatly inconsistent with the FLSA. The statute defines “sale” to mean, inter alia, a “consignment for sale,” and a “consignment for sale” does not involve the transfer of title. The DOL&para;<br>relies heavily on 29 CFR §541.501, which provides that “[s]ales . . .&para;<br>include the transfer of title to tangible property,” §541.501(b), but it&para;<br>is apparent that this regulation does not mean that a sale must include a transfer of title, only that transactions involving a transfer of&para;<br>title are included within the term “sale.” The DOL’s “explanation&para;<br>that obtaining a non-binding commitment to prescribe a drug constitutes promotion, and not sales,” Reply Brief for Petitioners 17, is also&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>unconvincing. Since promotion work that is performed incidental to&para;<br>an employee’s own sales is exempt, the DOL’s conclusion that detailers perform only nonexempt promotion work is only as strong as the&para;<br>reasoning underlying its conclusion that those employees do not&para;<br>make sales. Pp. 14–16.&para;<br>(c) Because the DOL’s interpretation is neither entitled to Auer&para;<br>deference nor persuasive in its own right, traditional tools of interpretation must be employed to determine whether petitioners are exempt outside salesmen. Pp. 16–24.&para;<br>(1) The FLSA does not furnish a clear answer to this question,&para;<br>but it provides at least one interpretive clue by exempting anyone&para;<br>“employed . . . in the capacity of [an] outside salesman.” 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§213(a)(1). The statute’s emphasis on “capacity” counsels in favor of&para;<br>a functional, rather than a formal, inquiry, one that views an employee’s responsibilities in the context of the particular industry in&para;<br>which the employee works. The DOL’s regulations provide additional&para;<br>guidance. Section 541.500 defines an outside salesman as an employee whose primary duty is “making sales” and adopts the statutory definition of “sale.” This statutory definition contains at least&para;<br>three important textual clues. First, the definition is introduced with&para;<br>the verb “includes,” which indicates that the examples enumerated&para;<br>in the text are illustrative, not exhaustive. See Burgess v. United&para;<br>States, 553 U. S. 124, 131, n. 3. Second, the list of transactions included in the statutory definition is modified by “any,” which, in the&para;<br>context of §203(k), is best read to mean “ ‘one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind,’ ” United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5.&para;<br>Third, the definition includes the broad catchall phrase “other disposition.” Under the rule of ejusdem generis, the catchall phrase is&para;<br>most reasonably interpreted as including those arrangements that&para;<br>are tantamount, in a particular industry, to a paradigmatic sale of a&para;<br>commodity. Nothing in the remaining regulations requires a narrower construction. Pp. 16–20.&para;<br>(2) Given this interpretation of “other disposition,” it follows that&para;<br>petitioners made sales under the FLSA and thus are exempt outside&para;<br>salesmen within the meaning of the DOL’s regulations. Petitioners&para;<br>obtain nonbinding commitments from physicians to prescribe respondent’s drugs. This kind of arrangement, in the unique regulatory environment within which pharmaceutical companies operate,&para;<br>comfortably falls within the catchall category of “other disposition.”&para;<br>That petitioners bear all of the external indicia of salesmen provides&para;<br>further support for this conclusion. And this holding also comports&para;<br>with the apparent purpose of the FLSA’s exemption. The exemption&para;<br>is premised on the belief that exempt employees normally earn salaries well above the minimum wage and perform a kind of work that is&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>difficult to standardize to a particular time frame and that cannot&para;<br>easily be spread to other workers. Petitioners—each of whom earned&para;<br>an average of more than $70,000 per year and spent 10 to 20 hours&para;<br>outside normal business hours each week performing work related to&para;<br>his assigned portfolio of drugs in his assigned sales territory—are&para;<br>hardly the kind of employees that the FLSA was intended to protect.&para;<br>Pp. 20–22.&para;<br>(3) Petitioners’ remaining arguments are also unavailing.&para;<br>Pp. 22–24.&para;<br>635 F. 3d 383, affirmed.&para;<br>ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

See §207(a). The overtime&para;<br>compensation requirement, however, does not apply with&para;<br>respect to all employees. See §213. As relevant here, the&para;<br>statute exempts workers “employed . . . in the capacity of&para;<br>outside salesman.” §213(a)(1).1&para;<br>Congress did not define the term “outside salesman,”&para;<br>but it delegated authority to the DOL to issue regulations&para;<br>“from time to time” to “defin[e] and delimi[t]” the term.&para;<br>Ibid. The DOL promulgated such regulations in 1938,&para;<br>1940, and 1949. In 2004, following notice-and-comment&para;<br>procedures, the DOL reissued the regulations with minor&para;<br>amendments. See 69 Fed. Reg. 22122 (2004). The current&para;<br>regulations are nearly identical in substance to the regula­&para;<br>tions issued in the years immediately following the FLSA’s&para;<br>enactment. See 29 CFR §§541.500541.504 (2011).&para;<br>Three of the DOL’s regulations are directly relevant to&para;<br>this case: §§541.500, 541.501, and 541.503. We refer to&para;<br>these three regulations as the “general regulation,” the&para;<br>“sales regulation,” and the “promotion-work regulation,”&para;<br>respectively.&para;<br>The general regulation sets out the definition of the&para;<br>statutory term “employee employed in the capacity of&para;<br>outside salesman.” It defines the term to mean “any&para;<br>employee . . . [w]hose primary duty is . . . making sales&para;<br>within the meaning of [29 U. S.

C. §203(k), states that “ ‘[s]ale’ or ‘sell’&para;<br>includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell, consignment&para;<br>for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.” Thus, under the general regulation, an outside salesman is any&para;<br>employee whose primary duty is making any sale, ex­&para;<br>change, contract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for&para;<br>sale, or other disposition.&para;<br>The sales regulation restates the statutory definition of&para;<br>sale discussed above and clarifies that “[s]ales within the&para;<br>meaning of [29 U.

Pharmaceutical companies pro­&para;<br>mote their prescription drugs to physicians through a&para;<br>process called “detailing,” whereby employees known as&para;<br>“detailers” or “pharmaceutical sales representatives”&para;<br>provide information to physicians about the company’s&para;<br>products in hopes of persuading them to write prescrip­&para;<br>tions for the products in appropriate cases.

The position of&para;<br>“detailer” has existed in the pharmaceutical industry in&para;<br>substantially its current form since at least the 1950’s,&para;<br>and in recent years the industry has employed more than&para;<br>90,000 detailers nationwide.

Perhaps because&para;<br>of the nebulous nature of this “consummated transaction”&para;<br>test,12 the Department changed course after we granted&para;<br>certiorari in this case. The Department now takes the&para;<br>position that “[a]n employee does not make a ‘sale’ for&para;<br>purposes of the ‘outside salesman’ exemption unless he&para;<br>actually transfers title to the property at issue.” Brief for&para;<br>United States as Amicus Curiae 1213 (hereinafter U.

Brief&para;<br>3034.14&para;<br>——————&para;<br>12 For example, it is unclear why a physician’s nonbinding commit­&para;<br>ment to prescribe a drug in an appropriate case cannot qualify as a sale&para;<br>under this test. The broad term “transaction” easily encompasses such&para;<br>a commitment. See Webster’s Third New International Dictionary&para;<br>2425 (2002) (hereinafter Webster’s Third) (defining “transaction” to&para;<br>mean “a communicative action or activity involving two parties or two&para;<br>things reciprocally affecting or influencing each other”). A “consum­&para;<br>mated transaction” is simply a transaction that has been fully completed.&para;<br>See id., at 490 (defining “consummate” to mean “to bring to comple­&para;<br>tion”). And a pharmaceutical sales representative who obtains such a&para;<br>commitment is “directly involv[ed]” in this transaction. Thus, once a&para;<br>pharmaceutical sales representative and a physician have fully com­&para;<br>pleted their agreement, it may be said that they have entered into a&para;<br>“consummated transaction.”&para;<br>13 When pressed to clarify its position at oral argument, the DOL&para;<br>suggested that a “transfer of possession in contemplation of a transfer&para;<br>of title” might also suffice. Tr. of Oral Arg. 17.&para;<br>14 Neither petitioners nor the DOL asks us to accord controlling def­&para;<br>erence to the “consummated transaction” interpretation the Depart­&para;<br>ment advanced in its briefs in the Second Circuit and Ninth Circuit, nor&para;<br>could we given that the Department has now abandoned that interpre­&para;<br>tation.

And defer­&para;<br>ence is likewise unwarranted when there is reason to&para;<br>suspect that the agency’s interpretation “does not reflect&para;<br>the agency’s fair and considered judgment on the matter&para;<br>in question.” Auer, supra, at 462; see also, e.g., Chase&para;<br>Bank, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14). This might occur&para;<br>when the agency’s interpretation conflicts with a prior&para;<br>interpretation, see, e.g., Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.

Until 2009, the&para;<br>pharmaceutical industry had little reason to suspect that&para;<br>its longstanding practice of treating detailers as exempt&para;<br>outside salesmen transgressed the FLSA. The statute and&para;<br>regulations certainly do not provide clear notice of this.&para;<br>The general regulation adopts the broad statutory defini­&para;<br>tion of “sale,” and that definition, in turn, employs the&para;<br>broad catchall phrase “other disposition.” See 29 CFR&para;<br>§541.500(a)(1). This catchall phrase could reasonably be&para;<br>construed to encompass a nonbinding commitment from a&para;<br>physician to prescribe a particular drug, and nothing in&para;<br>the statutory or regulatory text or the DOL’s prior guid­&para;<br>ance plainly requires a contrary reading. See Preamble&para;<br>22162 (explaining that an employee must “in some sense”&para;<br>make a sale); 1940 Report 46 (same).&para;<br>Even more important, despite the industry’s decades­&para;<br>long practice of classifying pharmaceutical detailers as&para;<br>exempt employees, the DOL never initiated any enforce­&para;<br>ment actions with respect to detailers or otherwise sug­&para;<br>gested that it thought the industry was acting unlaw­&para;<br>fully.16 We acknowledge that an agency’s enforcement&para;<br>decisions are informed by a host of factors, some bearing&para;<br>no relation to the agency’s views regarding whether a&para;<br>violation has occurred.

But where, as here, an agency’s announcement of&para;<br>its interpretation is preceded by a very lengthy period of&para;<br>conspicuous inaction, the potential for unfair surprise is&para;<br>acute. As the Seventh Circuit has noted, while it may be&para;<br>“possible for an entire industry to be in violation of the&para;<br>[FLSA] for a long time without the Labor Department&para;<br>noticing,” the “more plausible hypothesis” is that the De­&para;<br>partment did not think the industry’s practice was un­&para;<br>lawful. Yi v. Sterling Collision Centers, Inc., 480 F. 3d&para;<br>505, 510511 (2007). There are now approximately 90,000&para;<br>pharmaceutical sales representatives; the nature of their&para;<br>work has not materially changed for decades and is well&para;<br>known; these employees are well paid; and like quintes­&para;<br>sential outside salesmen, they do not punch a clock and&para;<br>often work more than 40 hours per week. Other than&para;<br>acquiescence, no explanation for the DOL’s inaction is&para;<br>plausible.&para;<br>Our practice of deferring to an agency’s interpretation&para;<br>of its own ambiguous regulations undoubtedly has im­&para;<br>portant advantages,17 but this practice also creates a risk&para;<br>that agencies will promulgate vague and open-ended&para;<br>regulations that they can later interpret as they see fit,&para;<br>thereby “frustrat[ing] the notice and predictability pur­&para;<br>poses of rulemaking.” Talk America, Inc. v.

It is one&para;<br>thing to expect regulated parties to conform their conduct&para;<br>to an agency’s interpretations once the agency announces&para;<br>them; it is quite another to require regulated parties to&para;<br>divine the agency’s interpretations in advance or else be&para;<br>held liable when the agency announces its interpretations&para;<br>for the first time in an enforcement proceeding and de­&para;<br>mands deference.&para;<br>Accordingly, whatever the general merits of Auer def­&para;<br>erence, it is unwarranted here. We instead accord the&para;<br>Department’s interpretation a measure of deference propor­&para;<br>tional to the “ ‘thoroughness evident in its consideration,&para;<br>the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier&para;<br>and later pronouncements, and all those factors which&para;<br>give it power to persuade.’ ” United States v. Mead Corp.,&para;<br>533 U. S. 218, 228 (2001) (quoting Skidmore v. Swift &amp;&para;<br>Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944)).&para;<br>B&para;<br>We find the DOL’s interpretation of its regulations quite&para;<br>unpersuasive. The interpretation to which we are now&para;<br>asked to defer—that a sale demands a transfer of title—&para;<br>plainly lacks the hallmarks of thorough consideration.&para;<br>Because the DOL first announced its view that pharma­&para;<br>ceutical sales representatives do not qualify as outside&para;<br>salesmen in a series of amicus briefs, there was no oppor­&para;<br>tunity for public comment, and the interpretation that&para;<br>initially emerged from the Department’s internal deci­&para;<br>sionmaking process proved to be untenable. After arguing&para;<br>successfully in the Second Circuit and then unsucessfully in the Ninth Circuit that a sale for present purposes&para;<br>simply requires a “consummated transaction,” the DOL ad­&para;<br>vanced a different interpretation in this Court. Here, the&para;<br>DOL’s brief states unequivocally that “[a]n employee does&para;<br>not make a ‘sale’ for purposes of the ‘outside salesman’&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>exemption unless he actually transfers title to the prop­&para;<br>erty at issue.” U. S. Brief 1213.&para;<br>This new interpretation is flatly inconsistent with the&para;<br>FLSA, which defines “sale” to mean, inter alia, a “con­&para;<br>signment for sale.” A “consignment for sale” does not&para;<br>involve the transfer of title. See, e.g., Sturm v. Boker, 150&para;<br>U. S. 312, 330 (1893) (“The agency to sell and return the&para;<br>proceeds, or the specific goods if not sold . . . does not&para;<br>involve a change of title”); Hawkland, Consignment Sell­&para;<br>ing Under the Uniform Commercial Code, 67 Com. L. J.&para;<br>146, 147 (1962) (explaining that “ ‘[a] consignment of goods&para;<br>for sale does not pass the title at any time, nor does it&para;<br>contemplate that it should be passed’ ” (quoting Rio&para;<br>Grande Oil Co. v. Miller Rubber Co. of N. Y., 31 Ariz. 84,&para;<br>87, 250 P. 564, 565 (1926))).&para;<br>The DOL cannot salvage its interpretation by arguing&para;<br>that a “consignment for sale” may eventually result in the&para;<br>transfer of title (from the consignor to the ultimate pur­&para;<br>chaser if the consignee in fact sells the good). Much the&para;<br>same may be said about a physician’s nonbinding com­&para;<br>mitment to prescribe a particular product in an appropri­&para;<br>ate case. In that situation, too, agreement may eventually&para;<br>result in the transfer of title (from the manufacturer to a&para;<br>pharmacy and ultimately to the patient for whom the drug&para;<br>is prescribed).&para;<br>In support of its new interpretation, the DOL relies&para;<br>heavily on its sales regulation, which states in part that&para;<br>“[s]ales [for present purposes] include the transfer of title&para;<br>to tangible property,” 29 CFR §541.501(b) (emphasis&para;<br>added). This regulation, however, provides little support&para;<br>for the DOL’s position. The DOL reads the sales regula­&para;<br>tion to mean that a “sale” necessarily includes the transfer&para;<br>of title, but that is not what the regulation says. And it&para;<br>seems clear that that is not what the regulation means.&para;<br>The sentence just subsequent to the one on which the DOL&para;<br>relies, echoing the terms of the FLSA, makes clear that a&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>“consignment for sale” qualifies as a sale. Since a con­&para;<br>signment for sale does not involve a transfer of title, it is&para;<br>apparent that the sales regulation does not mean that a&para;<br>sale must include a transfer of title, only that transactions&para;<br>involving a transfer of title are included within the term&para;<br>“sale.”&para;<br>Petitioners invite us to look past the DOL’s “determina­&para;<br>tion that a sale must involve the transfer of title” and&para;<br>instead defer to the Department’s “explanation that ob­&para;<br>taining a non-binding commitment to prescribe a drug&para;<br>constitutes promotion, and not sales.” Reply Brief for&para;<br>Petitioners 17. The problem with the DOL’s interpreta­&para;<br>tion of the promotion-work regulation, however, is that it&para;<br>depends almost entirely on the DOL’s flawed transfer-of­&para;<br>title interpretation. The promotion-work regulation does&para;<br>not distinguish between promotion work and sales; rather,&para;<br>it distinguishes between exempt promotion work and&para;<br>nonexempt promotion work. Since promotion work that is&para;<br>performed incidental to an employee’s own sales is ex­&para;<br>empt, the DOL’s conclusion that pharmaceutical detailers&para;<br>perform only nonexempt promotion work is only as strong&para;<br>as the reasoning underlying its conclusion that those&para;<br>employees do not make sales. For the reasons already&para;<br>discussed, we find this reasoning wholly unpersuasive.&para;<br>In light of our conclusion that the DOL’s interpretation&para;<br>is neither entitled to Auer deference nor persuasive in its&para;<br>own right, we must employ traditional tools of interpreta­&para;<br>tion to determine whether petitioners are exempt outside&para;<br>salesmen.&para;<br>C&para;<br>1&para;<br>We begin with the text of the FLSA. Although the&para;<br>provision that establishes the overtime salesman exemp­&para;<br>tion does not furnish a clear answer to the question before&para;<br>us, it provides at least one interpretive clue: It exempts&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>17&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>anyone “employed . . . in the capacity of [an] outside&para;<br>salesman.” 29 U. S. C. §213(a)(1) (emphasis added). “Ca­&para;<br>pacity,” used in this sense, means “[o]utward condition&para;<br>or circumstances; relation; character; position.” Webster’s&para;<br>New International Dictionary 396 (2d ed. 1934); see also 2&para;<br>Oxford English Dictionary 89 (def. 9) (1933) (“Position,&para;<br>condition, character, relation”). The statute’s emphasis on&para;<br>the “capacity” of the employee counsels in favor of a func­&para;<br>tional, rather than a formal, inquiry, one that views an&para;<br>employee’s responsibilities in the context of the particular&para;<br>industry in which the employee works.&para;<br>The DOL’s regulations provide additional guidance. The&para;<br>general regulation defines an outside salesman as an&para;<br>employee whose primary duty is “making sales,” and&para;<br>it adopts the statutory definition of “sale.” 29 CFR&para;<br>§541.500(a)(1)(i). This definition contains at least three&para;<br>important textual clues. First, the definition is introduced&para;<br>with the verb “includes” instead of “means.” This word&para;<br>choice is significant because it makes clear that the exam­&para;<br>ples enumerated in the text are intended to be illustrative,&para;<br>not exhaustive. See Burgess v. United States, 553 U. S.&para;<br>124, 131, n. 3 (2008) (explaining that “[a] term whose&para;<br>statutory definition declares what it ‘includes’ is more&para;<br>susceptible to extension of meaning . . . than where . . . the&para;<br>definition declares what a term ‘means’ ” (alteration in&para;<br>original; some internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed,&para;<br>Congress used the narrower word “means” in other provi­&para;<br>sions of the FLSA when it wanted to cabin a definition to&para;<br>a specific list of enumerated items. See, e.g., 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>§203(a) (“ ‘Person’ means an individual, partnership, asso­&para;<br>ciation, corporation, business trust, legal representative,&para;<br>or any organized group of persons” (emphasis added)).&para;<br>Second, the list of transactions included in the statu­&para;<br>tory definition of sale is modified by the word “any.” We&para;<br>have recognized that the modifier “any” can mean “differ­&para;<br>ent things depending upon the setting,” Nixon v. Missouri&para;<br>&para;<br>18&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Municipal League, 541 U. S. 125, 132 (2004), but in the&para;<br>context of 29 U. S. C. §203(k), it is best read to mean “ ‘one&para;<br>or some indiscriminately of whatever kind,’ ” United States&para;<br>v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5 (1997) (quoting Webster’s Third&para;<br>New International Dictionary 97 (1976)). That is so&para;<br>because Congress defined “sale” to include both the un­&para;<br>modified word “sale” and transactions that might not be&para;<br>considered sales in a technical sense, including exchanges&para;<br>and consignments for sale.18&para;<br>Third, Congress also included a broad catchall phrase:&para;<br>“other disposition.” Neither the statute nor the regula­&para;<br>tions define “disposition,” but dictionary definitions of the&para;<br>term range from “relinquishment or alienation” to “ar­&para;<br>rangement.” See Webster’s New International Dictionary&para;<br>644 (def. 1(b)) (1927) (“[t]he getting rid, or making over, of&para;<br>anything; relinquishment or alienation”); ibid. (def. 1(a))&para;<br>(“[t]he ordering, regulating, or administering of any­&para;<br>thing”); 3 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 493 (def. 4)&para;<br>(“[t]he action of disposing of, putting away, getting rid of,&para;<br>making over, etc.”); ibid. (def. 1) (“[t]he action of setting in&para;<br>order, or condition of being set in order; arrangement,&para;<br>order”). We agree with the DOL that the rule of ejusdem&para;<br>generis should guide our interpretation of the catchall&para;<br>phrase, since it follows a list of specific items.19 But the&para;<br>limit the DOL posits, one that would confine the phrase to&para;<br>dispositions involving “contract[s] for the exchange of&para;<br>goods or services in return for value,” see U. S. Brief 20, is&para;<br>——————&para;<br>18 Given that the FLSA provides its own definition of “sale” that is&para;<br>more expansive than the term’s ordinary meaning, the DOL’s reliance&para;<br>on dictionary definitions of the word “sale” is misplaced. See, e.g.,&para;<br>Burgess v. United States, 553 U.

In­&para;<br>deed, we are hard pressed to think of any contract for the&para;<br>exchange of goods or services in return for value or any&para;<br>firm agreement to buy that would not also fall within one&para;<br>of the specifically enumerated categories.20&para;<br>The specific list of transactions that precedes the phrase&para;<br>“other disposition” seems to us to represent an attempt to&para;<br>accommodate industry-by-industry variations in methods&para;<br>of selling commodities.

The dissent&para;<br>contends that, in order to make a sale, an employee must at least&para;<br>obtain a “firm commitment to buy.” Post, at 10 (opinion of BREYER, J.).&para;<br>But when an employee who has extended an offer to sell obtains a “firm&para;<br>commitment to buy,” that transaction amounts to a “contract to sell.”&para;<br>Given that a “contract to sell” already falls within the statutory defini­&para;<br>tion of “sale,” the dissent’s interpretation would strip the catchall&para;<br>phrase of independent meaning.&para;<br>21 In the past, we have stated that exemptions to the FLSA must be&para;<br>“narrowly construed against the employers seeking to assert them and&para;<br>their application limited to those [cases] plainly and unmistakably&para;<br>within their terms and spirit.” Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc., 361 U. S.&para;<br>388, 392 (1960).

See post, at 7; see&para;<br>also 1940 Report 46. There, the Department described a “sales promo­&para;<br>tion man” as an employee who merely “pav[es] the way for salesmen”&para;<br>and who frequently “deals with retailers who are not customers of his&para;<br>own employer but of his employer’s customer” and is “interested in&para;<br>sales by the retailer, not to the retailer.” 1940 Report 46. The dissent&para;<br>asserts that detailers are analogous to “sales promotion men” because&para;<br>they deal with “individuals, namely doctors, ‘who are not customers’ of&para;<br>their own employer” and “are primarily interested in sales authorized&para;<br>by the doctor, not to the doctor.” Post, at 7. But this comparison is&para;<br>inapt. The equivalent of a “sales promotion man” in the pharmaceuti­&para;<br>cal industry would be an employee who promotes a manufacturer’s&para;<br>products to the retail pharmacies that sell the products after purchas­&para;<br>ing them from a wholesaler or distributor. Detailers, by contrast,&para;<br>obtain nonbinding commitments from the gatekeepers who must&para;<br>prescribe the product if any sale is to take place at all.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U.

They&para;<br>were trained to close each sales call by obtaining the&para;<br>maximum commitment possible from the physician. They&para;<br>worked away from the office, with minimal supervision,&para;<br>and they were rewarded for their efforts with incentive&para;<br>compensation. It would be anomalous to require respond­&para;<br>ent to compensate petitioners for overtime, while at the&para;<br>same time exempting employees who function identically to&para;<br>petitioners in every respect except that they sell physician­&para;<br>administered drugs, such as vaccines and other injectable pharmaceuticals, that are ordered by the physician&para;<br>directly rather than purchased by the end user at a phar­&para;<br>macy with a prescription from the physician.&para;<br>Our holding also comports with the apparent purpose of&para;<br>the FLSA’s exemption for outside salesmen. The exemp­&para;<br>tion is premised on the belief that exempt employees&para;<br>“typically earned salaries well above the minimum wage”&para;<br>and enjoyed other benefits that “se[t] them apart from the&para;<br>nonexempt workers entitled to overtime pay.” Preamble&para;<br>22124.

See post, at 9 (noting that “the ‘most’ a California&para;<br>firm’s marketing employee may be able ‘to do’ to secure orders from&para;<br>New York customers is to post an advertisement on the Internet”).&para;<br>Rather, our point is that, when an entire industry is constrained by law&para;<br>or regulation from selling its products in the ordinary manner, an&para;<br>employee who functions in all relevant respects as an outside salesman&para;<br>should not be excluded from that category based on technicalities.&para;<br>&para;<br>22&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTOPHER v.

Petitioners—each of&para;<br>whom earned an average of more than $70,000 per year&para;<br>and spent between 10 and 20 hours outside normal busi­&para;<br>ness hours each week performing work related to his as­&para;<br>signed portfolio of drugs in his assigned sales territory—&para;<br>are hardly the kind of employees that the FLSA was&para;<br>intended to protect. And it would be challenging, to say&para;<br>the least, for pharmaceutical companies to compensate&para;<br>detailers for overtime going forward without significantly&para;<br>changing the nature of that position. See, e.g., Brief for&para;<br>PhRMA as Amicus Curiae 1420 (explaining that “key&para;<br>aspects of [detailers’] jobs as they are currently structured&para;<br>are fundamentally incompatible with treating [detailers]&para;<br>as hourly employees”).&para;<br>3&para;<br>The remaining arguments advanced by petitioners and&para;<br>the dissent are unavailing.

See 1949 Report 83&para;<br>(explaining that the manufacturer’s representative was&para;<br>clearly “performing sales work regardless of the fact that&para;<br>the order is filled by the jobber rather than directly by his&para;<br>own employer”); Preamble 22162 (noting that “technologi­&para;<br>cal changes in how orders are taken and processed should&para;<br>not preclude the exemption for employees who in some&para;<br>sense make the sales”).&para;<br>Petitioners additionally argue that detailers are the&para;<br>functional equivalent of employees who sell a “concept,”&para;<br>and they point to Wage and Hour Division opinion letters,&para;<br>as well as lower court decisions, deeming such employees&para;<br>nonexempt. See Brief for Petitioners 4748. Two of these&para;<br>opinions, however, concerned employees who were more&para;<br>analogous to buyers than to sellers. See Clements v.

In light of important, near-contemporaneous&para;<br>differences in the Justice Department’s views as to the&para;<br>meaning of relevant Labor Department regulations, see&para;<br>ante, at 8–9, I also agree that we should not give the Solicitor General’s current interpretive view any especially&para;<br>favorable weight. Ante, at 14. Thus, I am willing to assume, with the Court, that we should determine whether&para;<br>the statutory term covers the detailer’s job as here&para;<br>described through our independent examination of the&para;<br>statute’s language and the related Labor Department&para;<br>regulations. But, I conclude on that basis that a detailer&para;<br>is not an “outside salesman.”&para;<br>II&para;<br>The FLSA does not itself define the term “outside&para;<br>salesman.” Rather, it exempts from wage and hour requirements “any employee employed . . . in the capacity of&para;<br>outside salesman (as such terms are defined and delimited&para;<br>from time to time by regulations of the Secretary).” 29&para;<br>U. S. C. §213(a)(1) (emphasis added). Thus, we must look&para;<br>to relevant Labor Department regulations to answer the&para;<br>question. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources&para;<br>Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984); see also Long&para;<br>Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke, 551 U. S. 158, 165&para;<br>(2007) (explaining that “the FLSA explicitly leaves gaps”&para;<br>to be filled by regulations).&para;<br>There are three relevant regulations. The first is entitled “General rule for outside sales employees,” 29 CFR&para;<br>§541.500 (2011); the second is entitled “Making sales or&para;<br>obtaining orders,” §541.501; and the third is entitled&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“Promotion work,” §541.503. The relevant language of&para;<br>the first two regulations is similar. The first says that&para;<br>the term “ ‘employee employed in the capacity of outside&para;<br>salesman’ . . . shall mean any employee . . . [w]hose primary duty is: (i) making sales within the meaning of section 3(k) of the Act, or (ii) obtaining orders or contracts for&para;<br>services or for the use of facilities . . . .” §541.500(a)(1).&para;<br>The second regulation tells us that the first regulation&para;<br>“requires that the employee be engaged in . . . (1) Making&para;<br>sales within the meaning of section 3(k) of the Act, or (2)&para;<br>Obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of&para;<br>facilities.” §541.501(a).&para;<br>The second part of these quoted passages is irrelevant&para;<br>here, for it concerns matters not at issue, namely “orders&para;<br>or contracts for services or for the use of facilities.” The&para;<br>remaining parts of the two regulations are similarly irrelevant. See Appendix, infra. Thus, the relevant portions of&para;<br>the first two regulations say simply that the employee’s&para;<br>“primary duty” must be “making sales within the meaning&para;<br>of section 3(k) of the Act.” And §3(k) of the Act says that&para;<br>the word “ ‘Sale’ or ‘sell’ includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or&para;<br>other disposition.” 29 U. S. C. §203(k).&para;<br>Unless we give the words of the statute and regulations&para;<br>some special meaning, a detailer’s primary duty is not that&para;<br>of “making sales” or the equivalent. A detailer might&para;<br>convince a doctor to prescribe a drug for a particular kind&para;<br>of patient. If the doctor encounters such a patient, he&para;<br>might prescribe the drug. The doctor’s client, the patient,&para;<br>might take the prescription to a pharmacist and ask the&para;<br>pharmacist to fill the prescription. If so, the pharmacist&para;<br>might sell the manufacturer’s drug to the patient, or&para;<br>might substitute a generic version. But it is the pharmacist, not the detailer, who will have sold the drug.&para;<br>To put the same fairly obvious point in the language of&para;<br>the regulations and of §3(k) of the FLSA, see 29 U. S. C.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>§203(k), the detailer does not “sell” anything to the doctor.&para;<br>See Black’s Law Dictionary 1454 (9th ed. 2009) (defining&para;<br>“sale” as “[t]he transfer of property or title for a price”).&para;<br>Nor does he, during the course of that visit or immediately thereafter, “exchange” the manufacturer’s product for&para;<br>money or for anything else. He enters into no “contract to&para;<br>sell” on behalf of anyone. He “consigns” nothing “for sale.”&para;<br>He “ships” nothing for sale. He does not “dispose” of any&para;<br>product at all.&para;<br>What the detailer does is inform the doctor about the&para;<br>nature of the manufacturer’s drugs and explain their uses,&para;<br>their virtues, their drawbacks, and their limitations. The&para;<br>detailer may well try to convince the doctor to prescribe&para;<br>the manufacturer’s drugs for patients. And if the detailer&para;<br>is successful, the doctor will make a “nonbinding commitment” to write prescriptions using one or more of those&para;<br>drugs where appropriate. If followed, that “nonbinding&para;<br>commitment” is, at most, a nonbinding promise to consider&para;<br>advising a patient to use a drug where medical indications&para;<br>so indicate (if the doctor encounters such a patient), and to&para;<br>write a prescription that will likely (but may not) lead that&para;<br>person to order that drug under its brand name from the&para;<br>pharmacy. (I say “may not” because 30% of patients in a&para;<br>2-year period have not filled a prescription given to them&para;<br>by a doctor.

I put to the side the fact that neither&para;<br>the Court nor the record explains exactly what a “nonbinding commitment” is. Like a “definite maybe,” an “impossible solution,” or a “theoretical experience,” a “nonbinding&para;<br>commitment” seems to claim more than it can deliver.&para;<br>Regardless, other than in colloquial speech, to obtain a&para;<br>commitment to advise a client to buy a product is not to&para;<br>obtain a commitment to sell that product, no matter how&para;<br>often the client takes the advice (or the patient does what&para;<br>the doctor recommends).&para;<br>The third regulation, entitled “Promotion work,” lends&para;<br>support to this view. That is because the detailer’s work&para;<br>as described above is best viewed as promotion work. The&para;<br>regulation makes clear that promotion work falls within&para;<br>the statutory exemption only when the promotion work “is&para;<br>actually performed incidental to and in conjunction with&para;<br>an employee’s own outside sales or solicitations.” 29 CFR&para;<br>§541.503(a) (emphasis added). But it is not exempt if it is&para;<br>“incidental to sales made, or to be made, by someone else.”&para;<br>Ibid.&para;<br>The detailer’s work, in my view, is more naturally characterized as involving “[p]romotional activities designed to&para;<br>stimulate sales . . . made by someone else,” §541.503, e.g.,&para;<br>the pharmacist or the wholesaler, than as involving&para;<br>“[p]romotional activities designed to stimulate” the detailer’s “own sales.”&para;<br>Three other relevant documents support this reading.&para;<br>First, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers&para;<br>of America (PhRMA), of which respondent is a member, publishes a “Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals.”&para;<br>See PhRMA, Code on Interactions with&para;<br>Healthcare Professionals (PhRMA Code) (rev. July 2008),&para;<br>available at http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/108/&para;<br>phrma_marketing_code_2008.pdf. The PhRMA Code de-&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>scribes a detailer’s job in some depth. It consistently&para;<br>refers to detailers as “delivering accurate, up-to-date&para;<br>information to healthcare professionals,” id., at 14, and it&para;<br>stresses the importance of a doctor’s treatment decision&para;<br>being based “solely on each patient’s medical needs” and&para;<br>the doctor’s “medical knowledge and experience,” id., at 2.&para;<br>The PhRMA Code also forbids the offering or providing of&para;<br>anything “in a manner or on conditions that would interfere with the independence of a healthcare professional’s&para;<br>prescribing practices.” Id., at 13. But the PhRMA Code&para;<br>nowhere refers to detailers as if they were salesmen,&para;<br>rather than providers of information, nor does it refer to&para;<br>any kind of commitment.&para;<br>To the contrary, the document makes clear that the&para;<br>pharmaceutical industry itself understands that it cannot&para;<br>be a detailer’s “primary duty” to obtain a nonbinding&para;<br>commitment, for, in respect to many doctors, such a commitment taken alone is unlikely to make a significant&para;<br>difference to their doctor’s use of a particular drug. When&para;<br>a particular drug, say Drug D, constitutes the best treatment for a particular patient, a knowledgeable doctor&para;<br>should (hence likely will) prescribe it irrespective of any&para;<br>nonbinding commitment to do so. Where some other drug,&para;<br>however, is likely to prove more beneficial for a particular&para;<br>patient, that doctor should not (hence likely will not)&para;<br>prescribe Drug D irrespective of any nonbinding commitment to the contrary.&para;<br>At a minimum, the document explains why a detailer&para;<br>should not (hence likely does not) see himself as seeking&para;<br>primarily to obtain a promise to prescribe a particular&para;<br>drug, as opposed to providing information so that the&para;<br>doctor will keep the drug in mind with an eye toward&para;<br>using it when appropriate. And because the detailer’s&para;<br>“primary duty” is informational, as opposed to salesoriented, he fails to qualify as an outside salesman. See&para;<br>§541.500(a)(1)(i) (restricting the outside salesman exemp-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>tion to employees “[w]hose primary duty is . . . making&para;<br>sales” (emphasis added)). A detailer operating in accord&para;<br>with the PhRMA Code “sells” the product only in the way&para;<br>advertisers (particularly very low key advertisers) “sell” a&para;<br>product: by creating demand for the product, not by taking&para;<br>orders.&para;<br>Second, a Labor Department Wage and Hour Division&para;<br>Report written in 1940 further describes the work of “sales&para;<br>promotion men.” See Dept. of Labor, Wage and Hour&para;<br>Division, Report and Recommendations of the Presiding&para;<br>Officer at Hearings Preliminary to Redefinition (1940)&para;<br>(1940 Report). The 1940 Report says that such individuals&para;<br>“pav[e] the way” for sales by others. Id., at 46. “Frequently,”&para;<br>they deal “with [the] retailers who are not customers of [their] own employer but of [their] employer’s customer.” Ibid. And they are “primarily interested in sales by&para;<br>the retailer, not to the retailer.” Ibid. “[T]hey do not make&para;<br>actual sales,” and they “are admittedly not outside salesmen.” Ibid.&para;<br>Like the “sales promotion men,” the detailers before us&para;<br>deal with individuals, namely doctors, “who are not customers” of their own employer. And the detailers are&para;<br>primarily interested in sales authorized by the doctor, not&para;<br>to the doctor. According to the 1940 Report, sales promotion men are not “outside salesmen,” primarily because&para;<br>they seek to bring about, not their own sales, but sales by&para;<br>others. Thus, the detailers in this case are not “outside&para;<br>salesmen.”&para;<br>Third, a Wage and Hour Division Report written in 1949&para;<br>notes that where “work is promotional in nature it is&para;<br>sometimes difficult to determine whether it is incidental&para;<br>to the employee’s own sales work.” See Dept. of Labor,&para;<br>Wage and Hour Division, Report and Recommendations on&para;<br>Proposed Revisions of Regulations, Part 541, p. 82 (1949)&para;<br>(1949 Report). It adds that in borderline cases&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>“the test is whether the person is actually engaged&para;<br>in activities directed toward the consummation of his&para;<br>own sales, at least to the extent of obtaining a commitment to buy from the person to whom he is selling.&para;<br>If his efforts are directed toward stimulating the sales&para;<br>of his company generally rather than the consummation of his own specific sales his activities are not exempt.” Id., at 83 (emphasis added).&para;<br>The 1949 Report also refers to a&para;<br>“company representative who visits chain stores, arranges the merchandise on shelves, replenishes stock&para;<br>. . . , consults with the manager as to the requirements of the store, fills out a requisition for the quantity wanted and leaves it with the store manager&para;<br>to be transmitted to the central warehouse of the&para;<br>chain-store company which later ships the quantity requested.” Id., at 84.&para;<br>It says this company representative is not an “outside&para;<br>salesman” because he&para;<br>“does not consummate the sale nor direct his efforts&para;<br>toward the consummation of a sale (the store manager&para;<br>often has no authority to buy).” Ibid.&para;<br>See also 29 CFR §541.503(c) (explaining that if an employee “does not consummate the sale nor direct efforts toward the consummation of a sale, the work is not exempt&para;<br>outside sales work”)&para;<br>A detailer does not take orders, he does not consummate&para;<br>a sale, and he does not direct his efforts towards the consummation of any eventual sale (by the pharmacist) any&para;<br>more than does the “company’s representative” in the 1949&para;<br>Report’s example. The doctor whom the detailer visits,&para;<br>like the example’s store manager, “has no authority to&para;<br>buy.”&para;<br>Taken together, the statute, regulations, ethical codes,&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>and Labor Department Reports indicate that the drug&para;<br>detailers do not promote their “own sales,” but rather&para;<br>“sales made, or to be made, by someone else.” Therefore,&para;<br>detailers are not “outside salesmen.”&para;<br>III&para;<br>The Court’s different conclusion rests primarily upon its&para;<br>interpretation of the statutory words “other disposition” as&para;<br>“including those arrangements that are tantamount, in a&para;<br>particular industry, to a paradigmatic sale of a commodity.” Ante, at 19. Given the fact that the doctor buys nothing, the fact that the detailer sells nothing to the doctor,&para;<br>and the fact that any “nonbinding commitment” by the&para;<br>doctor must, of ethical necessity, be of secondary importance, there is nothing about the detailer’s visit with&para;<br>the doctor that makes the visit (or what occurs during the&para;<br>visit) “tantamount . . . to a paradigmatic sale.” Ibid. See&para;<br>Part I, supra.&para;<br>The Court adds that “[o]btaining a nonbinding commitment from a physician to prescribe one of respondent’s&para;<br>drugs is the most that petitioners were able to do to ensure the eventual disposition of the products that respondent sells.” Ante, at 20. And that may be so. But there is&para;<br>no “most they are able to do” test. After all, the “most” a&para;<br>California firm’s marketing employee may be able “to do”&para;<br>to secure orders from New York customers is to post an&para;<br>advertisement on the Internet, but that fact does not help&para;<br>qualify the posting employee as a “salesman.” The Court&para;<br>adds that it means to apply this test only when the law&para;<br>precludes “an entire industry . . . from selling its products&para;<br>in the ordinary manner.” Ante, at 21, n. 23. But the law&para;<br>might preclude an industry from selling its products&para;<br>through an outside salesman without thereby leading the&para;<br>legal term “outside salesman” to apply to whatever is the&para;<br>next best thing. In any event, the Court would be wrong&para;<br>to assume, if it does assume, that there is in nearly every&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>CHRISTOPHER v. SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP.&para;<br>BREYER, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>industry an outside salesman lurking somewhere (if only&para;<br>we can find him). An industry might, after all, sell its&para;<br>goods through wholesalers or retailers, while using its own&para;<br>outside employees to encourage sales only by providing&para;<br>third parties with critically important information.&para;<br>The Court expresses concern lest a holding that detailers are not “salesmen” lead to holdings that the statute&para;<br>forbids treating as a “salesman” an employee “who takes&para;<br>an order from a retailer but then transfers the order to a&para;<br>jobber’s employee to be filled,” ante, at 23, or “a car salesman who receives a commitment to buy but then asks his&para;<br>or her assistant to enter the order into the computer,” ibid.&para;<br>But there is no need for any such fear. Both these examples involve employees who are salesmen because they&para;<br>obtain a firm commitment to buy the product. See 1949&para;<br>Report 83 (as to the first example, such an employee “has&para;<br>obtained a commitment from the customer”); 69 Fed. Reg.&para;<br>22163 (2004) (as to the second example, explaining that&para;<br>“[e]xempt status should not depend on . . . who types the&para;<br>order into a computer,” but maintaining requirement that&para;<br>a salesman “obtai[n] a commitment to buy from the person&para;<br>to whom he is selling”). The problem facing the detailer is&para;<br>that he does not obtain any such commitment.&para;<br>Finally, the Court points to the detailers’ relatively high&para;<br>pay, their uncertain hours, the location of their work, their&para;<br>independence, and the fact that they frequently work&para;<br>overtime, all as showing that detailers fall within the&para;<br>basic purposes of the statutory provision that creates&para;<br>exceptions from wage and hour requirements. Ante, at 5–&para;<br>6. The problem for the detailers, however, is that the&para;<br>statute seeks to achieve its general objectives by creating&para;<br>certain categories of exempt employees, one of which is the&para;<br>category of “outside salesman.” It places into that category&para;<br>only those who satisfy the definition of “outside salesman” as “defined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the Secretary.” 29 U.
