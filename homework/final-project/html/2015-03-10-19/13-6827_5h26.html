HOBBS, DIRECTOR, &para;<br>&para;<br>ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION, ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 13–6827. Argued October 7, 2014—Decided January 20, 2015&para;<br>Section 3 of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act&para;<br>of 2000 (RLUIPA) provides that “[n]o government shall impose a sub­&para;<br>stantial burden on the religious exercise” of an institutionalized per­&para;<br>son unless the government demonstrates that the burden “is the least&para;<br>restrictive means of furthering [a] compelling governmental interest.”&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §2000cc–1(a).&para;<br>Petitioner is an Arkansas inmate and devout Muslim who wishes&para;<br>to grow a ½-inch beard in accordance with his religious beliefs. Re­&para;<br>spondent Arkansas Department of Correction (Department) prohibits&para;<br>its prisoners from growing beards, with the single exception that in­&para;<br>mates with diagnosed skin conditions may grow ¼-inch beards. Peti­&para;<br>tioner sought an exemption on religious grounds and, although he be­&para;<br>lieves that his faith requires him not to trim his beard at all, he&para;<br>proposed a compromise under which he would be allowed to maintain&para;<br>a ½-inch beard. Prison officials denied his request, and petitioner&para;<br>sued in Federal District Court. At an evidentiary hearing before a&para;<br>Magistrate Judge, Department witnesses testified that beards com­&para;<br>promised prison safety because they could be used to hide contraband&para;<br>and because an inmate could quickly shave his beard to disguise his&para;<br>identity. The Magistrate Judge recommended dismissing petitioner’s&para;<br>complaint, emphasizing that prison officials are entitled to deference&para;<br>on security matters and that the prison permitted petitioner to exer­&para;<br>cise his religion in other ways. The District Court adopted the rec­&para;<br>ommendation in full, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that&para;<br>the Department had satisfied its burden of showing that the groom­&para;<br>ing policy was the least restrictive means of furthering its compelling&para;<br>security interests, and reiterating that courts should defer to prison&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLT v. HOBBS&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>officials on matters of security.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The Department’s grooming policy violates RLUIPA insofar as it&para;<br>prevents petitioner from growing a ½-inch beard in accordance with&para;<br>his religious beliefs. Pp. 6–16.&para;<br>(a) Under RLUIPA, the challenging party bears the initial burden&para;<br>of proving that his religious exercise is grounded in a sincerely held&para;<br>religious belief, see Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U. S.&para;<br>___, ___, n. 28, and that the government’s action substantially bur­&para;<br>dens his religious exercise. Here, petitioner’s sincerity is not in dis­&para;<br>pute, and he easily satisfies the second obligation. The Department’s&para;<br>policy forces him to choose between “engag[ing] in conduct that seri­&para;<br>ously violates [his] religious belie[f],” id., at ___, or contravening the&para;<br>grooming policy and risking disciplinary action. In reaching the op­&para;<br>posite conclusion, the District Court misunderstood the analysis that&para;<br>RLUIPA demands. First, the District Court erred by concluding that&para;<br>the grooming policy did not substantially burden petitioner’s reli­&para;<br>gious exercise because he could practice his religion in other ways.&para;<br>Second, the District Court erroneously suggested that the burden on&para;<br>petitioner’s religious exercise was slight because petitioner testified&para;<br>that his religion would “credit” him for attempting to follow his reli­&para;<br>gious beliefs, even if that attempt proved unsuccessful. RLUIPA,&para;<br>however, applies to religious exercise regardless of whether it is&para;<br>“compelled.” §2000cc–5(7)(A). Finally, the District Court improperly&para;<br>relied on petitioner’s testimony that not all Muslims believe that men&para;<br>must grow beards. Even if petitioner’s belief were idiosyncratic,&para;<br>RLUIPA’s guarantees are “not limited to beliefs which are shared by&para;<br>all of the members of a religious sect.” Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indi­&para;<br>ana Employment Security Div., 450 U. S. 707, 715–716. Pp. 6–8.&para;<br>(b) Once the challenging party satisfies his burden, the burden&para;<br>shifts to the government to show that substantially burdening the re­&para;<br>ligious exercise of the “particular claimant” is “the least restrictive&para;<br>means of furthering [a] compelling governmental interest.” Hobby&para;<br>Lobby, supra, at ___; §2000cc–1(a). The Department fails to show&para;<br>that enforcing its beard prohibition against petitioner furthers its&para;<br>compelling interests in preventing prisoners from hiding contraband&para;<br>and disguising their identities. Pp. 8–13.&para;<br>(i) While the Department has a compelling interest in regulating&para;<br>contraband, its argument that this interest is compromised by allow­&para;<br>ing an inmate to grow a ½-inch beard is unavailing, especially given&para;<br>the difficulty of hiding contraband in such a short beard and the lack&para;<br>of a corresponding policy regulating the length of hair on the head.&para;<br>RLUIPA does not permit the unquestioning deference required to ac­&para;<br>cept the Department’s assessment. See Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita&para;<br>Beneficente União do Vegetal, 546 U. S. 418, 434. Even if the De­&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>partment could show that denying petitioner a ½-inch beard furthers&para;<br>its interest in rooting out contraband, it would still have to show that&para;<br>its policy is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest, a&para;<br>standard that is “exceptionally demanding” and requires the govern­&para;<br>ment to “sho[w] that it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal&para;<br>without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion by&para;<br>the objecting part[y].” Hobby Lobby, supra, at ___. Here, the De­&para;<br>partment fails to establish that its security concerns cannot be satis­&para;<br>fied by simply searching a ½-inch beard. Pp. 9–11.&para;<br>(ii) Even if the Department’s grooming policy furthers its compel­&para;<br>ling interest in prisoner identification, its policy still violates RLUIPA&para;<br>as applied in the present circumstances. As petitioner argues, re­&para;<br>quiring inmates to be photographed both with and without beards&para;<br>and then periodically thereafter is a less restrictive means of solving&para;<br>the Department’s identification concerns. The Department fails to&para;<br>show why its prison system is so different from the many institutions&para;<br>that allow facial hair that the dual-photo method cannot be employed&para;<br>at its institutions. It also fails to show why the security risk present­&para;<br>ed by a prisoner shaving a ½-inch beard is so different from the risk&para;<br>of a prisoner shaving a mustache, head hair, or ¼-inch beard.&para;<br>Pp. 11–13.&para;<br>(c) In addition to the Department’s failure to prove that petitioner’s&para;<br>proposed alternatives would not sufficiently serve its security inter­&para;<br>ests, the Department also fails to adequately explain the substantial&para;<br>underinclusiveness of its policy, since it permits ¼-inch beards for&para;<br>prisoners with medical conditions and more than ½ inch of hair on&para;<br>the head. Its failure to pursue its proffered objectives with regard to&para;<br>such “analogous nonreligious conduct” suggests that its interests&para;<br>“could be achieved by narrower ordinances that burdened religion to&para;<br>a far lesser degree.” Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah,&para;<br>508 U. S. 520, 546. Nor does the Department explain why the vast&para;<br>majority of States and the Federal Government can permit inmates&para;<br>to grow ½-inch beards, either for any reason or for religious reasons,&para;<br>but it cannot. Such evidence requires a prison, at a minimum, to of­&para;<br>fer persuasive reasons why it believes it must take a different course.&para;<br>See Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396, 414, n. 14.

Petitioner’s objection to shaving his&para;<br>beard clashes with the Arkansas Department of Correction’s grooming policy, which prohibits inmates from&para;<br>growing beards unless they have a particular dermatological condition. We hold that the Department’s policy, as&para;<br>applied in this case, violates the Religious Land Use and&para;<br>Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 114 Stat.&para;<br>803, 42 U. S. C. §2000cc et seq., which prohibits a state&para;<br>or local government from taking any action that substantially burdens the religious exercise of an institutionalized&para;<br>person unless the government demonstrates that the&para;<br>action constitutes the least restrictive means of furthering&para;<br>a compelling governmental interest.&para;<br>We conclude in this case that the Department’s policy&para;<br>substantially burdens petitioner’s religious exercise.&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLT v. HOBBS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Although we do not question the importance of the Department’s interests in stopping the flow of contraband&para;<br>and facilitating prisoner identification, we do doubt&para;<br>whether the prohibition against petitioner’s beard furthers&para;<br>its compelling interest about contraband. And we conclude that the Department has failed to show that its&para;<br>policy is the least restrictive means of furthering its compelling interests. We thus reverse the decision of the&para;<br>United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.&para;<br>I&para;<br>&para;<br>A&para;<br>&para;<br>Congress enacted RLUIPA and its sister statute, the&para;<br>Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107&para;<br>Stat. 1488, 42 U. S. C. §2000bb et seq., “in order to provide&para;<br>very broad protection for religious liberty.” Burwell v.&para;<br>Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip&para;<br>op., at 4). RFRA was enacted three years after our decision in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of&para;<br>Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990), which held that neutral, generally applicable laws that incidentally burden&para;<br>the exercise of religion usually do not violate the Free&para;<br>Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Id., at 878–882.&para;<br>Smith largely repudiated the method of analysis used in&para;<br>prior free exercise cases like Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S.&para;<br>205 (1972), and Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963).&para;<br>In those cases, we employed a balancing test that considered whether a challenged government action that substantially burdened the exercise of religion was necessary&para;<br>to further a compelling state interest. See Yoder, supra, at&para;<br>214, 219; Sherbert, supra, at 403, 406.&para;<br>Following our decision in Smith, Congress enacted&para;<br>RFRA in order to provide greater protection for religious&para;<br>exercise than is available under the First Amendment.&para;<br>See Hobby Lobby, supra, at ___ – ___ (slip op., at 5–6).&para;<br>RFRA provides that “[g]overnment shall not substantially&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>burden a person’s exercise of religion even if the burden&para;<br>results from a rule of general applicability,” unless the&para;<br>government “demonstrates that application of the burden&para;<br>to the person––(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means&para;<br>of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” 42&para;<br>U. S. C. §§2000bb–1(a), (b). In making RFRA applicable to&para;<br>the States and their subdivisions, Congress relied on&para;<br>Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, but in City of&para;<br>Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507 (1997), this Court held that&para;<br>RFRA exceeded Congress’ powers under that provision.&para;<br>Id., at 532–536.&para;<br>Congress responded to City of Boerne by enacting&para;<br>RLUIPA, which applies to the States and their subdivisions and invokes congressional authority under the&para;<br>Spending and Commerce Clauses. See §2000cc–1(b).&para;<br>RLUIPA concerns two areas of government activity: Section 2 governs land-use regulation, §2000cc; and Section&para;<br>3—the provision at issue in this case—governs religious&para;<br>exercise by institutionalized persons, §2000cc–1. Section 3&para;<br>mirrors RFRA and provides that “[n]o government shall&para;<br>impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a&para;<br>person residing in or confined to an institution . . . even if&para;<br>the burden results from a rule of general applicability,&para;<br>unless the government demonstrates that imposition of&para;<br>the burden on that person––(1) is in furtherance of a&para;<br>compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least&para;<br>restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” §2000cc–1(a). RLUIPA thus allows&para;<br>prisoners “to seek religious accommodations pursuant to&para;<br>the same standard as set forth in RFRA.” Gonzales v. O&para;<br>Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal, 546 U. S.&para;<br>418, 436 (2006).&para;<br>Several provisions of RLUIPA underscore its expansive&para;<br>protection for religious liberty. Congress defined “religious exercise” capaciously to include “any exercise of&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLT v. HOBBS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a&para;<br>system of religious belief.” §2000cc–5(7)(A). Congress&para;<br>mandated that this concept “shall be construed in favor of&para;<br>a broad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum&para;<br>extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the&para;<br>Constitution.” §2000cc–3(g). And Congress stated that&para;<br>RLUIPA “may require a government to incur expenses in&para;<br>its own operations to avoid imposing a substantial burden&para;<br>on religious exercise.” §2000cc–3(c). See Hobby Lobby,&para;<br>supra, at ___ – ___, ___ (slip op., at 6–7, 43).&para;<br>B&para;<br>Petitioner, as noted, is in the custody of the Arkansas&para;<br>Department of Correction and he objects on religious&para;<br>grounds to the Department’s grooming policy, which provides that “[n]o inmates will be permitted to wear facial&para;<br>hair other than a neatly trimmed mustache that does not&para;<br>extend beyond the corner of the mouth or over the lip.”&para;<br>App. to Brief for Petitioner 11a. The policy makes no&para;<br>exception for inmates who object on religious grounds, but&para;<br>it does contain an exemption for prisoners with medical&para;<br>needs: “Medical staff may prescribe that inmates with a&para;<br>diagnosed dermatological problem may wear facial hair no&para;<br>longer than one quarter of an inch.” Ibid. The policy&para;<br>provides that “[f]ailure to abide by [the Department’s]&para;<br>grooming standards is grounds for disciplinary action.”&para;<br>Id., at 12a.&para;<br>Petitioner sought permission to grow a beard and, although he believes that his faith requires him not to trim&para;<br>his beard at all, he proposed a “compromise” under which&para;<br>he would grow only a 1⁄2-inch beard. App. 164. Prison&para;<br>officials denied his request, and the warden told him:&para;<br>“[Y]ou will abide by [Arkansas Department of Correction]&para;<br>policies and if you choose to disobey, you can suffer the&para;<br>consequences.” No. 5:11–cv–00164 (ED Ark., July 21,&para;<br>2011), Doc. 13, p. 6 (Letter from Gaylon Lay to Gregory&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>Holt (July 19, 2011)).&para;<br>Petitioner filed a pro se complaint in Federal District&para;<br>Court challenging the grooming policy under RLUIPA.&para;<br>We refer to the respondent prison officials collectively as&para;<br>the Department. In October 2011, the District Court&para;<br>granted petitioner a preliminary injunction and remanded&para;<br>to a Magistrate Judge for an evidentiary hearing. At the&para;<br>hearing, the Department called two witnesses. Both&para;<br>expressed the belief that inmates could hide contraband in&para;<br>even a 1⁄2-inch beard, but neither pointed to any instances&para;<br>in which this had been done in Arkansas or elsewhere.&para;<br>Both witnesses also acknowledged that inmates could hide&para;<br>items in many other places, such as in the hair on their&para;<br>heads or their clothing. In addition, one of the witnesses—&para;<br>Gaylon Lay, the warden of petitioner’s prison—&para;<br>testified that a prisoner who escaped could change his&para;<br>appearance by shaving his beard, and that a prisoner&para;<br>could shave his beard to disguise himself and enter a&para;<br>restricted area of the prison. Neither witness, however,&para;<br>was able to explain why these problems could not be addressed by taking a photograph of an inmate without a&para;<br>beard, a practice followed in other prison systems. Lay&para;<br>voiced concern that the Department would be unable to&para;<br>monitor the length of a prisoner’s beard to ensure that it&para;<br>did not exceed one-half inch, but he acknowledged that the&para;<br>Department kept track of the length of the beards of those&para;<br>inmates who are allowed to wear a 1⁄4-inch beard for medical reasons.&para;<br>As a result of the preliminary injunction, petitioner had&para;<br>a short beard at the time of the hearing, and the Magistrate Judge commented: “I look at your particular circumstance and I say, you know, it’s almost preposterous to&para;<br>think that you could hide contraband in your beard.” App.&para;<br>155. Nevertheless, the Magistrate Judge recommended&para;<br>that the preliminary injunction be vacated and that petitioner’s complaint be dismissed for failure to state a claim&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLT v. HOBBS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>on which relief can be granted. The Magistrate Judge&para;<br>emphasized that “the prison officials are entitled to deference,” id., at 168, and that the grooming policy allowed&para;<br>petitioner to exercise his religion in other ways, such as by&para;<br>praying on a prayer rug, maintaining the diet required by&para;<br>his faith, and observing religious holidays.&para;<br>The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s&para;<br>recommendation in full, and the Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Eighth Circuit affirmed in a brief per curiam opinion,&para;<br>holding that the Department had satisfied its burden of&para;<br>showing that the grooming policy was the least restrictive&para;<br>means of furthering its compelling security interests. 509&para;<br>Fed. Appx. 561 (2013). The Court of Appeals stated that&para;<br>“courts should ordinarily defer to [prison officials’] expert&para;<br>judgment” in security matters unless there is substantial&para;<br>evidence that a prison’s response is exaggerated. Id., at&para;<br>562. And while acknowledging that other prisons allow&para;<br>inmates to maintain facial hair, the Eighth Circuit held&para;<br>that this evidence “does not outweigh deference owed to&para;<br>[the] expert judgment of prison officials who are more&para;<br>familiar with their own institutions.” Ibid.&para;<br>We entered an injunction pending resolution of petitioner’s petition for writ of certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2013), and&para;<br>we then granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2014).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Under RLUIPA, petitioner bore the initial burden of&para;<br>proving that the Department’s grooming policy implicates&para;<br>his religious exercise. RLUIPA protects “any exercise of&para;<br>religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a&para;<br>system of religious belief,” §2000cc–5(7)(A), but, of course,&para;<br>a prisoner’s request for an accommodation must be sincerely based on a religious belief and not some other motivation, see Hobby Lobby, 573 U. S., at ___, n. 28 (slip op.,&para;<br>at 29, n. 28). Here, the religious exercise at issue is the&para;<br>growing of a beard, which petitioner believes is a dictate of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>his religious faith, and the Department does not dispute&para;<br>the sincerity of petitioner’s belief.&para;<br>In addition to showing that the relevant exercise of&para;<br>religion is grounded in a sincerely held religious belief,&para;<br>petitioner also bore the burden of proving that the Department’s grooming policy substantially burdened that&para;<br>exercise of religion. Petitioner easily satisfied that obligation. The Department’s grooming policy requires petitioner to shave his beard and thus to “engage in conduct that&para;<br>seriously violates [his] religious beliefs.” Id., at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 32). If petitioner contravenes that policy and grows&para;<br>his beard, he will face serious disciplinary action. Because&para;<br>the grooming policy puts petitioner to this choice, it substantially burdens his religious exercise. Indeed, the&para;<br>Department does not argue otherwise.&para;<br>The District Court reached the opposite conclusion, but&para;<br>its reasoning (adopted from the recommendation of the&para;<br>Magistrate Judge) misunderstood the analysis that&para;<br>RLUIPA demands. First, the District Court erred by&para;<br>concluding that the grooming policy did not substantially&para;<br>burden petitioner’s religious exercise because “he had been&para;<br>provided a prayer rug and a list of distributors of Islamic&para;<br>material, he was allowed to correspond with a religious&para;<br>advisor, and was allowed to maintain the required diet&para;<br>and observe religious holidays.” App. 177. In taking this&para;<br>approach, the District Court improperly imported a strand&para;<br>of reasoning from cases involving prisoners’ First Amendment rights. See, e.g., O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482&para;<br>U. S. 342, 351–352 (1987); see also Turner v. Safley, 482&para;<br>U. S. 78, 90 (1987). Under those cases, the availability of&para;<br>alternative means of practicing religion is a relevant&para;<br>consideration, but RLUIPA provides greater protection.&para;<br>RLUIPA’s “substantial burden” inquiry asks whether the&para;<br>government has substantially burdened religious exercise&para;<br>(here, the growing of a 1⁄2-inch beard), not whether the&para;<br>RLUIPA claimant is able to engage in other forms of&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLT v. HOBBS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>religious exercise.&para;<br>Second, the District Court committed a similar error in&para;<br>suggesting that the burden on petitioner’s religious exercise was slight because, according to petitioner’s testimony, his religion would “credit” him for attempting to&para;<br>follow his religious beliefs, even if that attempt proved&para;<br>to be unsuccessful. RLUIPA, however, applies to an exercise of religion regardless of whether it is “compelled.”&para;<br>§2000cc–5(7)(A).&para;<br>Finally, the District Court went astray when it relied on&para;<br>petitioner’s testimony that not all Muslims believe that&para;<br>men must grow beards. Petitioner’s belief is by no means&para;<br>idiosyncratic. See Brief for Islamic Law Scholars as Amici&para;<br>Curiae 2 (“hadith requiring beards . . . are widely followed&para;<br>by observant Muslims across the various schools of Islam”). But even if it were, the protection of RLUIPA, no&para;<br>less than the guarantee of the Free Exercise Clause, is&para;<br>“not limited to beliefs which are shared by all of the members of a religious sect.” Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana&para;<br>Employment Security Div., 450 U. S. 707, 715–716 (1981).&para;<br>III&para;<br>Since petitioner met his burden of showing that the&para;<br>Department’s grooming policy substantially burdened his&para;<br>exercise of religion, the burden shifted to the Department&para;<br>to show that its refusal to allow petitioner to grow a 1⁄2inch beard “(1) [was] in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) [was] the least restrictive&para;<br>means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” §2000cc–1(a).&para;<br>The Department argues that its grooming policy represents the least restrictive means of furthering a “ ‘broadly&para;<br>formulated interes[t],’ ” see Hobby Lobby, supra, at ___&para;<br>(slip op., at 39) (quoting O Centro, 546 U. S., at 431),&para;<br>namely, the Department’s compelling interest in prison&para;<br>safety and security. But RLUIPA, like RFRA, contem-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>plates a “ ‘more focused’ ” inquiry and “ ‘requires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test&para;<br>is satisfied through application of the challenged law “to&para;<br>the person”––the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.’ ” Hobby&para;<br>Lobby, 573 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 39) (quoting O Centro,&para;<br>supra, at 430–431 (quoting §2000bb–1(b))). RLUIPA&para;<br>requires us to “ ‘scrutiniz[e] the asserted harm of granting&para;<br>specific exemptions to particular religious claimants’ ” and&para;<br>“to look to the marginal interest in enforcing” the challenged government action in that particular context.&para;<br>Hobby Lobby, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 39) (quoting O&para;<br>Centro, supra, at 431; alteration in original). In this case,&para;<br>that means the enforcement of the Department’s policy to&para;<br>prevent petitioner from growing a 1⁄2-inch beard.&para;<br>The Department contends that enforcing this prohibition is the least restrictive means of furthering prison&para;<br>safety and security in two specific ways.&para;<br>A&para;<br>The Department first claims that the no-beard policy&para;<br>prevents prisoners from hiding contraband. The Department worries that prisoners may use their beards to conceal all manner of prohibited items, including razors,&para;<br>needles, drugs, and cellular phone subscriber identity&para;<br>module (SIM) cards.&para;<br>We readily agree that the Department has a compelling&para;<br>interest in staunching the flow of contraband into and&para;<br>within its facilities, but the argument that this interest&para;<br>would be seriously compromised by allowing an inmate to&para;<br>grow a 1⁄2-inch beard is hard to take seriously. As noted,&para;<br>the Magistrate Judge observed that it was “almost preposterous to think that [petitioner] could hide contraband” in&para;<br>the short beard he had grown at the time of the evidentiary hearing. App. 155. An item of contraband would&para;<br>have to be very small indeed to be concealed by a 1⁄2-inch&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLT v. HOBBS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>beard, and a prisoner seeking to hide an item in such a&para;<br>short beard would have to find a way to prevent the item&para;<br>from falling out. Since the Department does not demand&para;<br>that inmates have shaved heads or short crew cuts, it is&para;<br>hard to see why an inmate would seek to hide contraband&para;<br>in a 1⁄2-inch beard rather than in the longer hair on his&para;<br>head.&para;<br>Although the Magistrate Judge dismissed the possibility&para;<br>that contraband could be hidden in a short beard, the&para;<br>Magistrate Judge, the District Court, and the Court of&para;<br>Appeals all thought that they were bound to defer to the&para;<br>Department’s assertion that allowing petitioner to grow&para;<br>such a beard would undermine its interest in suppressing&para;<br>contraband. RLUIPA, however, does not permit such&para;<br>unquestioning deference. RLUIPA, like RFRA, “makes&para;<br>clear that it is the obligation of the courts to consider&para;<br>whether exceptions are required under the test set forth&para;<br>by Congress.” O Centro, supra, at 434. That test requires&para;<br>the Department not merely to explain why it denied the&para;<br>exemption but to prove that denying the exemption is the&para;<br>least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. Prison officials are experts in running&para;<br>prisons and evaluating the likely effects of altering prison&para;<br>rules, and courts should respect that expertise. But that&para;<br>respect does not justify the abdication of the responsibility, conferred by Congress, to apply RLUIPA’s rigorous&para;<br>standard. And without a degree of deference that is tantamount to unquestioning acceptance, it is hard to swallow the argument that denying petitioner a 1⁄2-inch beard&para;<br>actually furthers the Department’s interest in rooting out&para;<br>contraband.&para;<br>Even if the Department could make that showing, its&para;<br>contraband argument would still fail because the Department cannot show that forbidding very short beards is the&para;<br>least restrictive means of preventing the concealment of&para;<br>contraband.&para;<br>“The least-restrictive-means standard is&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>11&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>exceptionally demanding,” and it requires the government&para;<br>to “sho[w] that it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the&para;<br>exercise of religion by the objecting part[y].” Hobby Lobby,&para;<br>supra, at ___ (slip op., at 40). “[I]f a less restrictive means&para;<br>is available for the Government to achieve its goals, the&para;<br>Government must use it.” United States v. Playboy Enter­&para;<br>tainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 815 (2000).&para;<br>The Department failed to establish that it could not&para;<br>satisfy its security concerns by simply searching petitioner’s beard. The Department already searches prisoners’&para;<br>hair and clothing, and it presumably examines the 1⁄4-inch&para;<br>beards of inmates with dermatological conditions. It has&para;<br>offered no sound reason why hair, clothing, and 1⁄4-inch&para;<br>beards can be searched but 1⁄2-inch beards cannot. The&para;<br>Department suggests that requiring guards to search a&para;<br>prisoner’s beard would pose a risk to the physical safety of&para;<br>a guard if a razor or needle was concealed in the beard.&para;<br>But that is no less true for searches of hair, clothing, and&para;<br>1⁄4-inch beards. And the Department has failed to prove&para;<br>that it could not adopt the less restrictive alternative of&para;<br>having the prisoner run a comb through his beard. For all&para;<br>these reasons, the Department’s interest in eliminating&para;<br>contraband cannot sustain its refusal to allow petitioner to&para;<br>grow a 1⁄2-inch beard.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The Department contends that its grooming policy is&para;<br>necessary to further an additional compelling interest, i.e.,&para;<br>preventing prisoners from disguising their identities. The&para;<br>Department tells us that the no-beard policy allows security officers to identify prisoners quickly and accurately. It&para;<br>claims that bearded inmates could shave their beards and&para;<br>change their appearance in order to enter restricted areas&para;<br>within the prison, to escape, and to evade apprehension&para;<br>after escaping.&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLT v. HOBBS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>We agree that prisons have a compelling interest in the&para;<br>quick and reliable identification of prisoners, and we&para;<br>acknowledge that any alteration in a prisoner’s appearance, such as by shaving a beard, might, in the absence of&para;<br>effective countermeasures, have at least some effect on the&para;<br>ability of guards or others to make a quick identification.&para;<br>But even if we assume for present purposes that the Department’s grooming policy sufficiently furthers its interest in the identification of prisoners, that policy still violates RLUIPA as applied in the circumstances present&para;<br>here. The Department contends that a prisoner who has a&para;<br>beard when he is photographed for identification purposes&para;<br>might confuse guards by shaving his beard. But as petitioner has argued, the Department could largely solve this&para;<br>problem by requiring that all inmates be photographed&para;<br>without beards when first admitted to the facility and, if&para;<br>necessary, periodically thereafter. Once that is done, an&para;<br>inmate like petitioner could be allowed to grow a short&para;<br>beard and could be photographed again when the beard&para;<br>reached the 1⁄2-inch limit. Prison guards would then have&para;<br>a bearded and clean-shaven photo to use in making identifications. In fact, the Department (like many other States,&para;<br>see Brief for Petitioner 39) already has a policy of photographing a prisoner both when he enters an institution&para;<br>and when his “appearance changes at any time during&para;<br>[his] incarceration.” Arkansas Department of Correction,&para;<br>Inmate Handbook 3–4 (rev. Jan. 2013).&para;<br>The Department argues that the dual-photo method is&para;<br>inadequate because, even if it might help authorities&para;<br>apprehend a bearded prisoner who escapes and then&para;<br>shaves his beard once outside the prison, this method is&para;<br>unlikely to assist guards when an inmate quickly shaves&para;<br>his beard in order to alter his appearance within the&para;<br>prison. The Department contends that the identification&para;<br>concern is particularly acute at petitioner’s prison, where&para;<br>inmates live in barracks and work in fields. Counsel for&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>13&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>the Department suggested at oral argument that a prisoner could gain entry to a restricted area by shaving&para;<br>his beard and swapping identification cards with another inmate while out in the fields. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28–30,&para;<br>39–43.&para;<br>We are unpersuaded by these arguments for at least two&para;<br>reasons. First, the Department failed to show, in the face&para;<br>of petitioner’s evidence, that its prison system is so different from the many institutions that allow facial hair that&para;<br>the dual-photo method cannot be employed at its institutions. Second, the Department failed to establish why the&para;<br>risk that a prisoner will shave a 1⁄2-inch beard to disguise&para;<br>himself is so great that 1⁄2-inch beards cannot be allowed,&para;<br>even though prisoners are allowed to grow mustaches,&para;<br>head hair, or 1⁄4-inch beards for medical reasons. All of&para;<br>these could also be shaved off at a moment’s notice, but&para;<br>the Department apparently does not think that this possibility raises a serious security concern.&para;<br>C&para;<br>In addition to its failure to prove that petitioner’s proposed alternatives would not sufficiently serve its security&para;<br>interests, the Department has not provided an adequate&para;<br>response to two additional arguments that implicate the&para;<br>RLUIPA analysis.&para;<br>First, the Department has not adequately demonstrated&para;<br>why its grooming policy is substantially underinclusive in&para;<br>at least two respects. Although the Department denied&para;<br>petitioner’s request to grow a 1⁄2-inch beard, it permits&para;<br>prisoners with a dermatological condition to grow 1⁄4-inch&para;<br>beards. The Department does this even though both&para;<br>beards pose similar risks. And the Department permits&para;<br>inmates to grow more than a 1⁄2-inch of hair on their&para;<br>heads. With respect to hair length, the grooming policy&para;<br>provides only that hair must be worn “above the ear” and&para;<br>“no longer in the back than the middle of the nape of the&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLT v. HOBBS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>neck.” App. to Brief for Petitioner 11a. Hair on the head&para;<br>is a more plausible place to hide contraband than a 1⁄2-inch&para;<br>beard—and the same is true of an inmate’s clothing and&para;<br>shoes. Nevertheless, the Department does not require&para;<br>inmates to go about bald, barefoot, or naked. Although the&para;<br>Department’s proclaimed objectives are to stop the flow of&para;<br>contraband and to facilitate prisoner identification, “[t]he&para;<br>proffered objectives are not pursued with respect to analogous nonreligious conduct,” which suggests that “those&para;<br>interests could be achieved by narrower ordinances that&para;<br>burdened religion to a far lesser degree.” Church of&para;<br>Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 546&para;<br>(1993).&para;<br>In an attempt to demonstrate why its grooming policy is&para;<br>underinclusive in these respects, the Department emphasizes that petitioner’s 1⁄2-inch beard is longer than the 1⁄4inch beard allowed for medical reasons. But the Department has failed to establish (and the District Court did not&para;<br>find) that a 1⁄4-inch difference in beard length poses a&para;<br>meaningful increase in security risk. The Department&para;<br>also asserts that few inmates require beards for medical&para;<br>reasons while many may request beards for religious&para;<br>reasons. But the Department has not argued that denying&para;<br>petitioner an exemption is necessary to further a compelling interest in cost control or program administration. At&para;<br>bottom, this argument is but another formulation of the&para;<br>“classic rejoinder of bureaucrats throughout history: If I&para;<br>make an exception for you, I’ll have to make one for everybody, so no exceptions.” O Centro, 546 U. S., at 436. We&para;<br>have rejected a similar argument in analogous contexts,&para;<br>see ibid.; Sherbert, 374 U. S., at 407, and we reject it again&para;<br>today.&para;<br>Second, the Department failed to show, in the face of&para;<br>petitioner’s evidence, why the vast majority of States and&para;<br>the Federal Government permit inmates to grow 1⁄2-inch&para;<br>beards, either for any reason or for religious reasons, but&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U. S. ____ (2015)&para;<br>&para;<br>15&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>it cannot. See Brief for Petitioner 24–25; Brief for United&para;<br>States as Amicus Curiae 28–29. “While not necessarily&para;<br>controlling, the policies followed at other well-run institutions would be relevant to a determination of the need for&para;<br>a particular type of restriction.” Procunier v. Martinez,&para;<br>416 U. S. 396, 414, n. 14 (1974). That so many other&para;<br>prisons allow inmates to grow beards while ensuring&para;<br>prison safety and security suggests that the Department&para;<br>could satisfy its security concerns through a means less&para;<br>restrictive than denying petitioner the exemption he&para;<br>seeks.&para;<br>We do not suggest that RLUIPA requires a prison to&para;<br>grant a particular religious exemption as soon as a few&para;<br>other jurisdictions do so. But when so many prisons offer&para;<br>an accommodation, a prison must, at a minimum, offer&para;<br>persuasive reasons why it believes that it must take a&para;<br>different course, and the Department failed to make that&para;<br>showing here. Despite this, the courts below deferred to&para;<br>these prison officials’ mere say-so that they could not&para;<br>accommodate petitioner’s request. RLUIPA, however,&para;<br>demands much more. Courts must hold prisons to their&para;<br>statutory burden, and they must not “assume a plausible,&para;<br>less restrictive alternative would be ineffective.” Playboy&para;<br>Entertainment, 529 U. S., at 824.&para;<br>We emphasize that although RLUIPA provides substantial protection for the religious exercise of institutionalized&para;<br>persons, it also affords prison officials ample ability to&para;<br>maintain security. We highlight three ways in which this&para;<br>is so. First, in applying RLUIPA’s statutory standard,&para;<br>courts should not blind themselves to the fact that the&para;<br>analysis is conducted in the prison setting. Second, if an&para;<br>institution suspects that an inmate is using religious&para;<br>activity to cloak illicit conduct, “prison officials may appropriately question whether a prisoner’s religiosity,&para;<br>asserted as the basis for a requested accommodation, is&para;<br>authentic.” Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 725, n. 13&para;<br>&para;<br>16&para;<br>&para;<br>HOLT v. HOBBS&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>(2005). See also Hobby Lobby, 573 U. S., at ___, n. 28 (slip&para;<br>op., at 29, n. 28). Third, even if a claimant’s religious&para;<br>belief is sincere, an institution might be entitled to withdraw an accommodation if the claimant abuses the exemption in a manner that undermines the prison’s compelling&para;<br>interests.&para;<br>IV&para;<br>In sum, we hold that the Department’s grooming policy&para;<br>violates RLUIPA insofar as it prevents petitioner from&para;<br>growing a 1⁄2-inch beard in accordance with his religious&para;<br>beliefs. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is reversed, and the case is&para;<br>remanded for further proceedings consistent with this&para;<br>opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 574 U.

Of course, that is not to say that cost alone&para;<br>is an absolute defense to an otherwise meritorious&para;<br>RLUIPA claim. See §2000cc–3(c). Thus, we recognized&para;<br>“that prison security is a compelling state interest, and&para;<br>that deference is due to institutional officials’ expertise in&para;<br>this area.” Cutter, 544 U.

But&para;<br>the deference that must be “extend[ed to] the experience&para;<br>and expertise of prison administrators does not extend so&para;<br>far that prison officials may declare a compelling governmental interest by fiat.” Yellowbear v. Lampert, 741 F. 3d&para;<br>48, 59 (CA10 2014). Indeed, prison policies “ ‘grounded on&para;<br>mere speculation’ ” are exactly the ones that motivated&para;<br>Congress to enact RLUIPA. 106 Cong.
