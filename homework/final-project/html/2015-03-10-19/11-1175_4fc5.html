GENERAL REVENUE CORP.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE TENTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–1175. Argued November 7, 2012—Decided February 26, 2013&para;<br>Petitioner Marx filed suit, alleging that General Revenue Corporation&para;<br>(GRC) violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) by&para;<br>harassing and falsely threatening her in order to collect on a debt.&para;<br>The District Court ruled against Marx and awarded GRC costs pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 54(d)(1), which gives&para;<br>district courts discretion to award costs to prevailing defendants&para;<br>“[u]nless a federal statute . . . provides otherwise.” Marx sought to&para;<br>vacate the award, arguing that the court’s discretion under Rule&para;<br>54(d)(1) was displaced by 15 U. S. C. §1692k(a)(3), which provides, in&para;<br>pertinent part, that “[o]n a finding by the court that an action under&para;<br>this section was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, the court may award to the defendant attorney’s fees reasonable in relation to the work expended and costs.” The District Court&para;<br>rejected Marx’s argument. The Tenth Circuit affirmed, in pertinent&para;<br>part, agreeing that costs are allowed under the Rule and concluding&para;<br>that nothing in the statute’s text, history, or purpose indicates that it&para;<br>was meant to displace the Rule.&para;<br>Held: Section §1692k(a)(3) is not contrary to, and, thus, does not displace a district court’s discretion to award costs under, Rule 54(d)(1).&para;<br>Pp. 4–16.&para;<br>(a) Rule 54(d)(1) gives courts discretion to award costs to prevailing&para;<br>parties, but this discretion can be displaced by a federal statute or&para;<br>FRCP that “provides otherwise,” i.e., is “contrary” to Rule 54(d)(1).&para;<br>Contrary to the argument of Marx and the United States, as amicus,&para;<br>language of the original 1937 version of the Rule does not suggest&para;<br>that any “express provision” for costs should displace Rule 54(d)(1),&para;<br>regardless of whether it is contrary to the Rule. Pp. 4–7.&para;<br>(b) Section 1692k(a)(3)’s language and context demonstrate that&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>the provision is not contrary to Rule 54(d)(1). Pp. 7–15.&para;<br>(1) GRC argues that since §1692k(a)(3) does not address whether&para;<br>costs may be awarded in an FDCPA case brought in good faith, it&para;<br>does not set forth a standard that is contrary to the Rule and therefore does not displace the presumption that a court has discretion to&para;<br>award costs. Marx and the United States concede that the statute&para;<br>does not expressly limit a court’s discretion to award costs under the&para;<br>Rule, but argue that it does so by negative implication. They claim&para;<br>that unless §1692k(a)(3) sets forth the exclusive basis on which to&para;<br>award costs, the phrase “and costs” would be superfluous with Rule&para;<br>54(d)(1). And the United States also argues that §1692k(a)(3)’s more&para;<br>specific cost statute displaces Rule 54(d)(1)’s more general rule.&para;<br>Pp. 7–9.&para;<br>(2) The argument of Marx and the United States depends critically on whether §1692k(a)(3)’s allowance of costs creates a negative&para;<br>implication that costs are unavailable in any other circumstances.&para;<br>The expressio unius canon that they invoke does not apply “unless it&para;<br>is fair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed possibility&para;<br>and meant to say no to it,” Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S.&para;<br>149, 168, and can be overcome by “contrary indications that adopting&para;<br>a particular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal any exclusion,” United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55, 65. Here, context indicates that Congress did not intend §1692k(a)(3) to foreclose courts&para;<br>from awarding costs under the Rule. First, under the American Rule,&para;<br>each litigant generally pays his own attorney’s fees, but the Court&para;<br>has long recognized that federal courts have inherent power to award&para;<br>attorney’s fees in a narrow set of circumstances, e.g., when a party&para;<br>brings an action in bad faith. The statute is thus best read as codifying a court’s pre-existing authority to award both attorney’s fees and&para;<br>costs. Next, §1692k(a)(3)’s second sentence must be understood in&para;<br>light of its first, which provides an award of attorney’s fees and costs,&para;<br>but to prevailing plaintiffs. By adding “and costs” to the second sentence, Congress foreclosed the argument that defendants can only recover attorney’s fees when plaintiffs bring an action in bad faith and&para;<br>removed any doubt that defendants may recover costs as well as attorney’s fees in such cases. Finally, §1692k(a)(3)’s language sharply&para;<br>contrasts with that of other statutes in which Congress has placed&para;<br>conditions on awarding costs to prevailing defendants. See, e.g., 28&para;<br>U. S. C. §1928. Pp. 9–12.&para;<br>(3) Even assuming that their surplusage argument is correct, the&para;<br>canon against surplusage is not absolute. First, the canon “assists&para;<br>only where a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause&para;<br>and word of a statute.” Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564&para;<br>U. S. ___, ___. Here, no interpretation of §1692k(a)(3) gives effect to&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>every word. Second, redundancy is not unusual in statutes addressing costs. See, e.g., 12 U. S. C. §2607(d)(5). Finally, the canon is&para;<br>strongest when an interpretation would render superfluous another&para;<br>part of the same statutory scheme. Because §1692k(a)(3) is not part&para;<br>of Rule 54(d)(1), the force of this canon is diminished. Pp. 13–14.&para;<br>(4) Lastly, contrary to the United States’ claim that specific costshifting standards displace general ones, the context of the statute&para;<br>indicates that Congress was simply confirming the background presumption that courts may award to defendants attorney’s fees and&para;<br>costs when the plaintiff brings an action in bad faith. Because Marx&para;<br>did not bring this suit in bad faith, the specific provision is not applicable.

We conclude that §1692k(a)(3)&para;<br>does not “provid[e] otherwise,” and thus a district court&para;<br>may award costs to prevailing defendants in FDCPA cases&para;<br>without finding that the plaintiff brought the case in bad&para;<br>faith and for the purpose of harassment.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Petitioner Olivea Marx defaulted on a student loan&para;<br>guaranteed by EdFund, a division of the California Student Aid Commission.

One month later, Marx filed an FDCPA enforcement action against GRC.1 Marx alleged that GRC&para;<br>had violated the FDCPA by harassing her with phone calls&para;<br>several times a day and falsely threatening to garnish up&para;<br>to 50% of her wages and to take the money she owed&para;<br>directly from her bank account. Shortly after the complaint was filed, GRC made an offer of judgment under&para;<br>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 to pay Marx $1,500,&para;<br>plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, to settle any&para;<br>claims she had against it. Marx did not respond to the&para;<br>offer. She subsequently amended her complaint to add&para;<br>a claim that GRC unlawfully sent a fax to her workplace&para;<br>that requested information about her employment status.&para;<br>Following a 1-day bench trial, the District Court found&para;<br>that Marx had failed to prove any violation of the FDCPA.&para;<br>As the prevailing party, GRC submitted a bill of costs&para;<br>seeking $7,779.16 in witness fees, witness travel expenses,&para;<br>and deposition transcript fees.

The District Court rejected Marx’s argument, concluding that&para;<br>§1692k(a)(3) does not displace a court’s discretion to award&para;<br>costs under Rule 54(d)(1) and that costs should also be&para;<br>awarded under Rule 68(d).&para;<br>The Tenth Circuit affirmed but agreed only with part&para;<br>of the District Court’s reasoning. In particular, the court&para;<br>disagreed that costs were allowed under Rule 68(d). 668&para;<br>F. 3d 1174, 1182 (2011). It explained that “Rule 68 applies&para;<br>only where the district court enters judgment in favor of&para;<br>a plaintiff ” for less than the amount of the settlement offer&para;<br>and not where the plaintiff loses outright. Ibid. (citing&para;<br>Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. August, 450 U.

Id., at&para;<br>1178, 1182. After describing the “venerable” presumption&para;<br>that prevailing parties are entitled to costs, id., at 1179,&para;<br>the court concluded that nothing in the text, history, or&para;<br>purpose of §1692k(a)(3) indicated that it was meant to&para;<br>displace Rule 54(d)(1), id., at 1178–1182.

Because the Rule grants district courts discretion to award costs, a statute is contrary to the Rule if&para;<br>it limits that discretion. A statute may limit a court’s discretion in several ways, and it need not expressly state&para;<br>that it is displacing Rule 54(d)(1) to do so. For instance,&para;<br>a statute providing that “plaintiffs shall not be liable for&para;<br>costs” is contrary to Rule 54(d)(1) because it precludes a&para;<br>court from awarding costs to prevailing defendants.

Similarly, a statute providing that plaintiffs may recover costs only under certain&para;<br>conditions is contrary to Rule 54(d) because it precludes a&para;<br>court from awarding costs to prevailing plaintiffs when&para;<br>those conditions have not been satisfied.

Such a provision is not contrary to Rule 54(d)(1) and does not displace the court’s&para;<br>discretion under the Rule”).&para;<br>Marx and the United States as amicus curiae suggest&para;<br>that any statute that specifically provides for costs displaces Rule 54(d)(1), regardless of whether it is contrary to&para;<br>the Rule. Brief for Petitioner 17; Brief for United States&para;<br>as Amicus Curiae 11–12 (hereinafter Brief for United&para;<br>States). The United States relies on the original 1937&para;<br>version of Rule 54(d)(1), which provided, “ ‘Except when&para;<br>express provision therefor is made either in a statute of&para;<br>the United States or in these rules, costs shall be allowed&para;<br>as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.’ ” Id., at 12 (quoting Rule). Though the&para;<br>Rules Committee updated the language of Rule 54(d)(1) in&para;<br>2007, the change was “stylistic only.” Advisory Committee’s Notes, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 734 (2006 ed., Supp. V).&para;<br>Accordingly, the United States asserts that any “express&para;<br>provision” for costs should displace Rule 54(d)(1).&para;<br>We are not persuaded, however, that the original version of Rule 54(d) should be interpreted as Marx and the&para;<br>United States suggest. The original language was meant&para;<br>to ensure that Rule 54(d) did not displace existing costs&para;<br>provisions that were contrary to the Rule. Under the prior&para;<br>language, statutes that simply permitted a court to award&para;<br>costs did not displace the Rule. See 6 J. Moore, Moore’s&para;<br>Federal Practice §54.71[1], p. 54–304 (2d ed. 1996)&para;<br>(“[W]hen permissive language is used [in a statute regarding costs] the district court may, pursuant to Rule 54(d),&para;<br>exercise a sound discretion relative to the allowance of&para;<br>costs”). Rather, statutes had to set forth a standard for&para;<br>awarding costs that was different from Rule 54(d)(1) in&para;<br>order to displace the Rule. See Friedman v. Ganassi, 853&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>F. 2d 207, 210 (CA3 1988) (holding that 15 U. S.

The original version of Rule 54(d) is consistent with our conclusion that a statute must be contrary&para;<br>to Rule 54(d)(1) in order to displace it.4&para;<br>B&para;<br>We now turn to whether §1692k(a)(3) is contrary to Rule&para;<br>54(d)(1).

Post, at 2 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). That interpretation renders the Rule meaningless because every statute is “different” insofar as it is not an exact copy of the Rule. Next, it argues&para;<br>that a statute “provides otherwise” if it is an “ ‘express provision’&para;<br>relating to costs.” Post, at 2–3. Under that view, a statute providing&para;<br>that “the court may award costs to the prevailing party” would “provide&para;<br>otherwise.” We do not think such a statute provides otherwise—it&para;<br>provides “same-wise,” and the treatise on which the dissent relies&para;<br>supports our view. See 10 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal&para;<br>Practice and Procedure §2670, p. 258 (3d ed. 1998 and Supp. 2012)&para;<br>(“[Statutes that] are permissive in character . . . are not inconsistent&para;<br>with the discretion given the district court by Rule 54(d)”). Finally,&para;<br>the dissent seems to implicitly accept that “otherwise” means “to the&para;<br>contrary” in the course of arguing that a doctor’s instruction to take&para;<br>medication “ ‘in the morning’ ” would supersede an instruction on the&para;<br>medication label to “ ‘take [it] twice a day unless otherwise directed,’ ”&para;<br>because the patient would understand the doctor’s advice to mean that&para;<br>he should take the medicine “once a day, each morning.” Post, at 4. If&para;<br>the patient understands the doctor to mean “once a day, each morning,”&para;<br>we agree that such advice would “provide otherwise,” because the&para;<br>doctor’s order would be “contrary” to the label’s instruction. For the&para;<br>reasons set forth in Part II–B, however, we are not convinced that&para;<br>§1692k(a)(3) is “contrary” to Rule 54(d)(1).&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MARX v.

It,&para;<br>therefore, expressly provided that when plaintiffs bring an&para;<br>action in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, the&para;<br>court may award attorney’s fees and costs to the defendant. The statute does address this type of case—i.e., cases&para;<br>in which the plaintiff brings the action in bad faith and&para;<br>for the purpose of harassment. But it is silent where bad&para;<br>faith and purpose of harassment are absent, and silence&para;<br>does not displace the background rule that a court has&para;<br>discretion to award costs.&para;<br>Marx and the United States take the contrary view.&para;<br>They concede that the language does not expressly limit&para;<br>a court’s discretion to award costs under Rule 54(d)(1),&para;<br>Brief for Petitioner 10; Brief for United States 19, but&para;<br>argue that it does so by negative implication. Invoking the&para;<br>expressio unius canon of statutory construction, they&para;<br>contend that by specifying that a court may award attorney’s fees and costs when an action is brought in bad faith&para;<br>and for the purpose of harassment, Congress intended to&para;<br>preclude a court from awarding fees and costs when bad&para;<br>faith and purpose of harassment are absent.

The force of any negative&para;<br>implication, however, depends on context. We have long&para;<br>held that the expressio unius canon does not apply “unless&para;<br>it is fair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed&para;<br>possibility and meant to say no to it,” Barnhart v. Peabody&para;<br>Coal Co., 537 U.

Vonn, 535 U. S. 55, 65&para;<br>(2002). In this case, context persuades us that Congress&para;<br>did not intend §1692k(a)(3) to foreclose courts from awarding costs under Rule 54(d)(1).&para;<br>First, the background presumptions governing attorney’s&para;<br>fees and costs are a highly relevant contextual feature.&para;<br>As already explained, under Rule 54(d)(1) a prevailing&para;<br>party is entitled to recover costs from the losing party&para;<br>unless a federal statute, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or a court order “provides otherwise.” The opposite&para;<br>presumption exists with respect to attorney’s fees.

Notwithstanding&para;<br>the American Rule, however, we have long recognized that&para;<br>federal courts have inherent power to award attorney’s&para;<br>fees in a narrow set of circumstances, including when a&para;<br>party brings an action in bad faith. See Chambers v.&para;<br>NASCO, Inc., 501 U.

The fact that there might&para;<br>have been a negative implication that costs are precluded,&para;<br>depending on whether Congress included or excluded the&para;<br>phrase “and costs,” weighs against giving effect to any&para;<br>implied limitation.&para;<br>Finally, the language in §1692k(a)(3) sharply contrasts&para;<br>with other statutes in which Congress has placed conditions on awarding costs to prevailing defendants. See, e.g.,&para;<br>28 U. S.

These statutes confirm&para;<br>that Congress knows how to limit a court’s discretion&para;<br>under Rule 54(d)(1) when it so desires. See Small v. United&para;<br>States, 544 U. S. 385, 398 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (explaining that “Congress’ explicit use of [language]&para;<br>in other provisions shows that it specifies such restrictions&para;<br>when it wants to do so”). Had Congress intended the&para;<br>second sentence of §1692k(a)(3) to displace Rule 54(d)(1),&para;<br>it could have easily done so by using the word “only” before setting forth the condition “[o]n a finding by the court&para;<br>that an action . . . was brought in bad faith and for the&para;<br>purpose of harassment . . . .”8&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Marx also suggests that §1692k(a)(3) is similar to the Pipeline&para;<br>Safety Act, 49 U. S. C. §60121(b), which provides: “The court may award&para;<br>costs to a prevailing defendant when the action is unreasonable, frivolous, or meritless.” We have never had occasion to interpret §60121(b)&para;<br>and its interaction with Rule 54(d)(1).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 568 U.

But&para;<br>even assuming that our interpretation renders the phrase&para;<br>“and costs” superfluous, that would not alter our conclusion. The canon against surplusage is not an absolute&para;<br>rule, see Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548 U.

Partnership,&para;<br>564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks omitted). But, in this case, no interpretation of&para;<br>§1692k(a)(3) gives effect to every word. Both Marx and&para;<br>the United States admit that a court has inherent power&para;<br>to award attorney’s fees to a defendant when the plaintiff&para;<br>brings an action in bad faith. Because there was, consequently, no need for Congress to specify that courts have&para;<br>this power, §1692k(a)(3) is superfluous insofar as it addresses attorney’s fees. In light of this redundancy, we are&para;<br>not overly concerned that the reference to costs may be&para;<br>redundant as well.&para;<br>Second, redundancy is “hardly unusual” in statutes&para;<br>addressing costs.

After invoking this principle,&para;<br>however, the majority casts it aside entirely in interpreting the statute and the Rule.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Rule 54(d)(1) states, as relevant here, that “[u]nless a&para;<br>federal statute . . . provides otherwise, costs—other than&para;<br>attorney’s fees—should be allowed to the prevailing&para;<br>party.” The first question is what it means for a statute&para;<br>to “provid[e] otherwise” than Rule 54(d)(1).&para;<br>Because the phrase “provides otherwise” is not defined&para;<br>in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we look to its&para;<br>ordinary meaning. Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513&para;<br>U. S. 179, 187 (1995). In common usage, to “provide otherwise” means to “make a . . . stipulation” that is “differen[t].” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary&para;<br>1598, 1827 (2002) (Webster’s Third) (defining “provide”&para;<br>and “otherwise,” respectively); see Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1372, 1556 (2d ed. 1987)&para;<br>(Random House) (“to arrange for or stipulate” “[i]n another&para;<br>manner”); 10 Oxford English Dictionary 984 (2d ed. 1989)&para;<br>(Oxford Dictionary); 12 id., at 713 (“to stipulate” “[i]n&para;<br>another way . . . ; in a different manner”).

If Congress has enacted a provision with&para;<br>respect to costs in a statute, there is no longer any need&para;<br>for the default, so it gives way. This design of the Rule is&para;<br>sensible, because many statutes contain specific costs&para;<br>provisions. 10 Moore’s Federal Practice §54.101[1][c], p.&para;<br>54–160 (3d ed. 2012) (noting that such statutes “are far&para;<br>too numerous to list comprehensively”).

In §1692k(a)(3), Congress described with specificity a single circumstance in&para;<br>which costs may be awarded. Far from merely restating a&para;<br>district court’s discretion to award costs, this provision&para;<br>imposes a prerequisite to the exercise of that discretion: a&para;<br>finding by the court that an action was brought in bad&para;<br>faith and for the purpose of harassment.&para;<br>Because the text is plain, there is no need to proceed&para;<br>any further. Even so, relevant canons of statutory interpretation lend added support to reading §1692k(a)(3) as&para;<br>having a negative implication. That reading accords with&para;<br>the expressio unius, exclusio alterius canon, which instructs that when Congress includes one possibility in a&para;<br>statute, it excludes another by implication. See Chevron&para;<br>U. S. A. Inc. v. Echazabal, 536 U. S. 73, 80–81 (2002).&para;<br>This rule reinforces what the text makes clear.

Under this “most basic of interpretative&para;<br>canons, . . . ‘ “[a] statute should be constructed so that&para;<br>effect is given to all of its provisions, so that no part will be&para;<br>inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.” ’ ” Corley&para;<br>v.

Respondent’s reading,&para;<br>as it mostly acknowledges, renders the entire sentence&para;<br>meaningless because it reiterates powers that federal&para;<br>courts already possess with respect to both costs and&para;<br>attorney’s fees. See Brief for Respondent 22–24.&para;<br>The majority rejects this argument, citing the rule that&para;<br>this canon “ ‘assists only where a competing interpretation&para;<br>gives effect to every clause and word of a statute.’ ” Ante,&para;<br>at 13 (quoting Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd.

In its view, neither&para;<br>of the available interpretations can eliminate superfluity&para;<br>because the attorney’s fees provision is redundant under&para;<br>any reading. Ante, at 13. But the canon against superfluity surely counsels against an interpretation that renders&para;<br>the entire provision at issue superfluous when a competing interpretation would at least render part of the provision meaningful. Nor does the majority’s observation that&para;<br>redundancy is “ ‘hardly unusual,’ ” ante, at 14, in provisions relating to costs make the canon inapplicable.

In Cooper Industries, Inc.&para;<br>v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U.

We rejected the argument that the word&para;<br>“may” indicated that “during a civil action” was one but&para;<br>not the exclusive circumstance in which the right of contribution was available. 543 U.

Cf. Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd.,&para;<br>566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 4). Because Congress&para;<br>deviated from Rule 54(d)(1) in the first sentence of&para;<br>§1692k(a)(3), the most reasonable reading is that the&para;<br>sentence that immediately follows, which states the rule&para;<br>for prevailing defendants, takes a similar path.&para;<br>The majority believes that its reading of the costs provision follows from the first sentence as well, but for a different reason. Ante, at 11–12. It suggests that if Congress&para;<br>had not included costs in the second sentence, a plaintiff&para;<br>might have been able to argue that the inclusion of costs&para;<br>in the first sentence and the exclusion of costs in the&para;<br>second indicated that defendants could recover only fees&para;<br>when an action is brought in bad faith.
