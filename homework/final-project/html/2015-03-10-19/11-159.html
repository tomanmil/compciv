ET AL. &para;<br>&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 11–159.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued March 19, 2012—Decided May 21, 2012&para;<br>&para;<br>Eighteen months after her husband, Robert Capato, died of cancer, respondent Karen Capato gave birth to twins conceived through in&para;<br>vitro fertilization using her husband’s frozen sperm. Karen applied&para;<br>for Social Security survivors benefits for the twins. The Social Security Administration (SSA) denied her application, and the District&para;<br>Court affirmed. In accord with the SSA’s construction of the Social&para;<br>Security Act (Act), the court determined that the twins would qualify&para;<br>for benefits only if, as 42 U. S. C. §416(h)(2)(A) specifies, they could&para;<br>inherit from the deceased wage earner under state intestacy law.&para;<br>The court then found that Robert was domiciled in Florida at his&para;<br>death, and that under Florida law, posthumously conceived children&para;<br>do not qualify for inheritance through intestate succession. The&para;<br>Third Circuit reversed. It concluded that, under §416(e), which defines child to mean, inter alia, “the child or legally adopted child of an&para;<br>[insured] individual,” the undisputed biological children of an insured&para;<br>and his widow qualify for survivors benefits without regard to state&para;<br>intestacy law.&para;<br>Held: The SSA’s reading is better attuned to the statute’s text and its&para;<br>design to benefit primarily those supported by the deceased wage&para;<br>earner in his or her lifetime. Moreover, even if the SSA’s longstanding interpretation is not the only reasonable one, it is at least a permissible construction entitled to deference under Chevron U. S. A.&para;<br>Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837. Pp. 4–&para;<br>16.&para;<br>(a) Congress amended the Act in 1939 to provide that, as relevant&para;<br>here, “[e]very child (as defined in section 416(e) of this title)” of a de-&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>ASTRUE v. CAPATO&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>ceased insured individual “shall be entitled to a child’s insurance&para;<br>benefit.” §402(d). Section 416(e), in turn, defines “child” to mean:&para;<br>“(1) the child or legally adopted child of an individual, (2) a stepchild&para;<br>[under certain circumstances], and (3) . . . the grandchild or&para;<br>stepgrandchild of an individual or his spouse [under certain conditions].” Unlike §§416(e)(2) and (3), §416(e)(1) lacks any elaboration of&para;<br>the conditions under which a child qualifies for benefits. Section&para;<br>416(h)(2)(A), however, further addresses the term “child,” providing:&para;<br>“In determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of [an]&para;<br>insured individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner&para;<br>of Social Security shall apply [the intestacy law of the insured individual’s domiciliary State].” An applicant who does not meet&para;<br>§416(h)(2)(A)’s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless qualify for&para;<br>benefits under other criteria set forth in §§416(h)(2)(B) and (h)(3), but&para;<br>respondent does not claim eligibility under those other criteria. Regulations promulgated by the SSA closely track §§416(h)(2) and (3) in&para;<br>defining “[w]ho is the insured’s natural child,” 20 CFR §404.355. As&para;<br>the SSA reads the statute, 42 U. S. C. §416(h) governs the meaning of&para;<br>“child” in §416(e)(1) and serves as a gateway through which all applicants for insurance benefits as a “child” must pass. Pp. 4–7.&para;<br>(b) While the SSA regards §416(h) as completing §416(e)’s sparse&para;<br>definition of “child,” the Third Circuit held, and respondent contends,&para;<br>that §416(e) alone governs whenever the claimant is a married couple’s biological child. There are conspicuous flaws in the Third Circuit’s and respondent’s reading; the SSA offers the more persuasive&para;<br>interpretation. Pp. 7–15.&para;<br>(1) Nothing in §416(e)’s tautological definition suggests that&para;<br>Congress understood the word “child” to refer only to the children of&para;<br>married parents. The dictionary definitions offered by respondent&para;<br>are not so confined. Moreover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress expressly limited the category of children covered to offspring of a marital union, see §402(d)(3)(A), and contemporaneous statutes similarly&para;<br>distinguish child of a marriage from the unmodified term “child.”&para;<br>Nor does §416(e) indicate that Congress intended “biological” parentage to be prerequisite to “child” status. A biological parent is not always a child’s parent under law. Furthermore, marriage does not&para;<br>necessarily make a child’s parentage certain, nor does the absence of&para;<br>marriage necessarily make a child’s parentage uncertain. Finally, it&para;<br>is far from obvious that respondent’s proposed definition would cover&para;<br>her posthumously conceived twins, for under Florida law a marriage&para;<br>ends upon the death of a spouse. Pp. 8–10.&para;<br>(2) The SSA finds a key textual cue in §416(h)(2)(A)’s opening instruction: “In determining whether an applicant is the child . . . of&para;<br>[an] insured individual for purposes of this subchapter,” the Commis-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U. S. ____ (2012)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>sioner shall apply state intestacy law. Respondent notes the absence&para;<br>of any cross-reference in §416(e) to §416(h), but she overlooks that&para;<br>§416(h) provides the crucial link: It requires reference to state intestacy law to determine child status not just for §416(h) purposes, but&para;<br>“for purposes of this subchapter,” which includes both §§402(d) and&para;<br>416(e). Having explicitly complemented §416(e) by the definitional&para;<br>provisions contained in §416(h), Congress had no need to place a redundant cross-reference in §416(e).&para;<br>The Act commonly refers to state law on matters of family status,&para;<br>including an applicant’s status as a wife, widow, husband, or widower. See, e.g., §§416(b), (h)(1)(A). The Act also sets duration-ofrelationship limitations, see Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 777–&para;<br>782, and time limits qualify the statutes of several States that accord&para;<br>inheritance rights to posthumously conceived children. In contrast,&para;<br>no time constraint attends the Third Circuit’s ruling in this case, under which the biological child of married parents is eligible for survivors benefits, no matter the length of time between the father’s death&para;<br>and the child’s conception and birth.&para;<br>Because a child who may take from a father’s estate is more likely&para;<br>to “be dependent during the parent’s life and at his death,” Mathews&para;<br>v. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 514, reliance on state intestacy law to determine who is a “child” serves the Act’s driving objective, which is to&para;<br>“provide . . . dependent members of [a wage earner’s] family with protection against the hardship occasioned by [the] loss of [the insured’s]&para;<br>earnings,” Califano v. Jobst, 434 U. S. 47, 52. Although the Act and&para;<br>regulations set different eligibility requirements for adopted children,&para;<br>stepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchildren, it hardly follows,&para;<br>as respondent argues, that applicants in those categories are treated&para;<br>more advantageously than are children who must meet a §416(h) criterion. Respondent charges that the SSA’s construction of the Act&para;<br>raises serious constitutional concerns under the equal protection&para;<br>component of the Due Process Clause. But under rational-basis review, the appropriate standard here, the regime passed by Congress&para;<br>easily passes inspection. Pp. 10–15.&para;<br>(c) Because the SSA’s interpretation of the relevant provisions, is&para;<br>at least reasonable, the agency’s reading is entitled to this Court’s&para;<br>deference under Chevron, 467 U. S. 837. Chevron deference is appropriate “when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the&para;<br>agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the&para;<br>agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.” United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218,&para;<br>226–227. Here, the SSA’s longstanding interpretation, set forth in&para;<br>regulations published after notice-and-comment rulemaking, is neither “arbitrary or capricious in substance, [n]or manifestly contrary&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>ASTRUE v. CAPATO&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>to the statute.” Mayo Foundation for Medical Ed. and Research v.&para;<br>United States, 562 U. S. ___, ___. It therefore warrants the Court’s&para;<br>approbation.

Robert died&para;<br>of cancer less than three years later. With the help of in&para;<br>vitro fertilization, Karen gave birth to twins 18 months&para;<br>after her husband’s death. Karen’s application for Social&para;<br>Security survivors benefits for the twins, which the Social&para;<br>Security Administration (SSA) denied, prompted this litigation. The technology that made the twins’ conception&para;<br>and birth possible, it is safe to say, was not contemplated&para;<br>by Congress when the relevant provisions of the Social&para;<br>Security Act (Act) originated (1939) or were amended to&para;<br>read as they now do (1965).&para;<br>Karen Capato, respondent here, relies on the Act’s&para;<br>initial definition of “child” in 42 U. S. C. §416(e): “ ‘[C]hild’&para;<br>means . . . the child or legally adopted child of an [insured]&para;<br>individual.” Robert was an insured individual, and the&para;<br>twins, it is uncontested, are the biological children of&para;<br>Karen and Robert.

Because the couple wanted&para;<br>children, Robert, before undergoing chemotherapy, deposited his semen in a sperm bank, where it was frozen and&para;<br>stored. Despite Robert’s aggressive treatment regime,&para;<br>Karen conceived naturally and gave birth to a son in&para;<br>August 2001. The Capatos, however, wanted their son to&para;<br>have a sibling.&para;<br>Robert’s health deteriorated in late 2001, and he died in&para;<br>Florida, where he and Karen then resided, in March 2002.&para;<br>His will, executed in Florida, named as beneficiaries the&para;<br>son born of his marriage to Karen and two children from&para;<br>a previous marriage. The will made no provision for children conceived after Robert’s death, although the Capatos&para;<br>had told their lawyer they wanted future offspring to be&para;<br>placed on a par with existing children. Shortly after Robert’s death, Karen began in vitro fertilization using her&para;<br>husband’s frozen sperm. She conceived in January 2003&para;<br>and gave birth to twins in September 2003, 18 months&para;<br>after Robert’s death.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

The SSA denied her application, and&para;<br>the U. S. District Court for the District of New Jersey&para;<br>affirmed the agency’s decision. See App. to Pet. for Cert.&para;<br>33a (decision of the Administrative Law Judge); id., at&para;<br>15a (District Court opinion). In accord with the SSA’s&para;<br>construction of the statute, the District Court determined&para;<br>that the twins would qualify for benefits only if, as&para;<br>§416(h)(2)(A) specifies, they could inherit from the deceased wage earner under state intestacy law. Robert&para;<br>Capato died domiciled in Florida, the court found.

To resolve the conflict, we granted the Commissioner’s petition for a writ of certiorari. 565 U. S. ___&para;<br>(2011).&para;<br>II&para;<br>Congress amended the Social Security Act in 1939 to&para;<br>provide a monthly benefit for designated surviving family members of a deceased insured wage earner. “Child’s&para;<br>insurance benefits” are among the Act’s family-protective&para;<br>measures. 53 Stat. 1364, as amended, 42 U. S. C. §402(d).&para;<br>An applicant qualifies for such benefits if she meets the&para;<br>Act’s definition of “child,” is unmarried, is below specified&para;<br>age limits (18 or 19) or is under a disability which began&para;<br>prior to age 22, and was dependent on the insured at the&para;<br>time of the insured’s death. §402(d)(1).3&para;<br>To resolve this case, we must decide whether the Capato&para;<br>twins rank as “child[ren]” under the Act’s definitional&para;<br>provisions. Section 402(d) provides that “[e]very child (as&para;<br>defined in section 416(e) of this title)” of a deceased insured individual “shall be entitled to a child’s insurance&para;<br>benefit.” Section 416(e), in turn, states: “The term ‘child’&para;<br>means (1) the child or legally adopted child of an individ——————&para;<br>3 Applicants not in fact dependent on the insured individual may be&para;<br>“deemed dependent” when the Act so provides. For example, a “legitimate” child, even if she is not living with or receiving support from&para;<br>her parent, is ordinarily “deemed dependent” on that parent. 42 U. S. C.&para;<br>§402(d)(3). Further, applicants “deemed” the child of an insured&para;<br>individual under §416(h)(2)(B) or (h)(3) are also “deemed legitimate,”&para;<br>hence dependent, even if not living with or receiving support from&para;<br>the parent. §402(d)(3).

Unlike&para;<br>§§416(e)(2) and (3), which specify the circumstances under&para;<br>which stepchildren and grandchildren qualify for benefits,&para;<br>§416(e)(1) lacks any elaboration. Compare §416(e)(1)&para;<br>(referring simply to “the child . . . of an individual”) with,&para;<br>e.g., §416(e)(2) (applicant must have been a stepchild for at&para;<br>least nine months before the insured individual’s death).&para;<br>A subsequent definitional provision further addresses&para;<br>the term “child.” Under the heading “Determination of&para;<br>family status,” §416(h)(2)(A) provides: “In determining&para;<br>whether an applicant is the child or parent of [an] insured&para;<br>individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner of Social Security shall apply [the intestacy law of&para;<br>the insured individual’s domiciliary State].”4&para;<br>An applicant for child benefits who does not meet&para;<br>§416(h)(2)(A)’s intestacy-law criterion may nonetheless&para;<br>qualify for benefits under one of several other criteria the&para;<br>Act prescribes. First, an applicant who “is a son or daughter” of an insured individual, but is not determined to be a&para;<br>“child” under the intestacy-law provision, nevertheless&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Section 416(h)(2)(A) also states that persons who, under the law of&para;<br>the insured’s domicile, “would have the same status relative to taking&para;<br>intestate personal property as a child or parent shall be deemed such.”&para;<br>Asked about this prescription, counsel for the SSA responded that it&para;<br>would apply to equitably adopted children. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8–9, 54; see&para;<br>20 CFR §404.359 (2011) (an equitably adopted child may be eligible for&para;<br>benefits if the agreement to adopt the child would be recognized under&para;<br>state law as enabling the child to inherit upon the intestate death of&para;<br>the adopting parent).&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>ASTRUE v. CAPATO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ranks as a “child” if the insured and the other parent went&para;<br>through a marriage ceremony that would have been valid&para;<br>but for certain legal impediments. §416(h)(2)(B). Further,&para;<br>an applicant is deemed a “child” if, before death, the insured acknowledged in writing that the applicant is his or&para;<br>her son or daughter, or if the insured had been decreed by&para;<br>a court to be the father or mother of the applicant, or had&para;<br>been ordered to pay child support. §416(h)(3)(C)(i). In&para;<br>addition, an applicant may gain “child” status upon&para;<br>proof that the insured individual was the applicant’s parent and “was living with or contributing to the support&para;<br>of the applicant” when the insured individual died.&para;<br>§416(h)(3)(C)(ii).5&para;<br>The SSA has interpreted these provisions in regulations&para;<br>adopted through notice-and-comment rulemaking. The&para;<br>regulations state that an applicant may be entitled to&para;<br>benefits “as a natural child, legally adopted child, stepchild, grandchild, stepgrandchild, or equitably adopted&para;<br>child.” 20 CFR §404.354. Defining “[w]ho is the insured’s&para;<br>natural child,” §404.355, the regulations closely track&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §§416(h)(2) and (h)(3). They state that an&para;<br>applicant may qualify for insurance benefits as a “natural&para;<br>child” by meeting any of four conditions: (1) the applicant&para;<br>“could inherit the insured’s personal property as his or her&para;<br>natural child under State inheritance laws”; (2) the applicant is “the insured’s natural child and [his or her parents]&para;<br>went through a ceremony which would have resulted in&para;<br>a valid marriage between them except for a legal impediment”; (3) before death, the insured acknowledged in&para;<br>writing his or her parentage of the applicant, was decreed&para;<br>by a court to be the applicant’s parent, or was ordered by a&para;<br>court to contribute to the applicant’s support; or (4) other&para;<br>evidence shows that the insured is the applicant’s “natural&para;<br>——————&para;<br>5 Respondent does not invoke any of the alternative criteria as a basis&para;<br>for the twins’ “child” status.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

S. C. §416(h) governs the meaning of “child” in §416(e)(1). In other words,&para;<br>§416(h) is a gateway through which all applicants for insurance benefits as a “child” must pass. See Beeler, 651&para;<br>F. 3d, at 960 (“The regulations make clear that the SSA&para;<br>interprets the Act to mean that the provisions of §416(h)&para;<br>are the exclusive means by which an applicant can establish ‘child’ status under §416(e) as a natural child.”).6&para;<br>III&para;<br>Karen Capato argues, and the Third Circuit held, that&para;<br>§416(h), far from supplying the governing law, is irrelevant in this case. Instead, the Court of Appeals determined, §416(e) alone is dispositive of the controversy. 631&para;<br>F. 3d, at 630–631. Under §416(e), “child” means “child of&para;<br>an [insured] individual,” and the Capato twins, the Third&para;<br>Circuit observed, clearly fit that definition: They are undeniably the children of Robert Capato, the insured wage&para;<br>earner, and his widow, Karen Capato. Section 416(h)&para;<br>comes into play, the court reasoned, only when “a claimant’s status as a deceased wage-earner’s child is in doubt.”&para;<br>Id., at 631. That limitation, the court suggested, is evident from §416(h)’s caption: “Determination of family&para;<br>status.” Here, “there is no family status to determine,” the&para;<br>court said, id., at 630, so §416(h) has no role to play.&para;<br>In short, while the SSA regards §416(h) as completing&para;<br>§416(e)’s sparse definition of “child,” the Third Circuit&para;<br>considered each subsection to control different situations:&para;<br>§416(h) governs when a child’s family status needs to be&para;<br>determined; §416(e), when it does not.

The answer&para;<br>that the Third Circuit found plain: whenever the claimant&para;<br>is “the biological child of a married couple.” Id., at 630.7&para;<br>We point out, first, some conspicuous flaws in the Third&para;<br>Circuit’s and respondent Karen Capato’s reading of the&para;<br>Act’s provisions, and then explain why we find the SSA’s&para;<br>interpretation persuasive.&para;<br>A&para;<br>Nothing in §416(e)’s tautological definition (“ ‘child’&para;<br>means . . . the child . . . of an individual”) suggests that&para;<br>Congress understood the word “child” to refer only to the&para;<br>children of married parents. The dictionary definitions&para;<br>offered by respondent are not so confined. See Webster’s&para;<br>New International Dictionary 465 (2d ed. 1934) (defining&para;<br>“child” as, inter alia, “[i]n Law, legitimate offspring; also,&para;<br>sometimes, esp. in wills, an adopted child, or an illegitimate offspring, or any direct descendant, as a grandchild,&para;<br>as the intention may appear”); Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 214 (11th ed. 2003) (“child” means “son or&para;<br>daughter,” or “descendant”). See also Restatement (Third)&para;<br>of Property §2.5(1) (1998) (“[a]n individual is the child of&para;<br>his or her genetic parents,” and that may be so “whether&para;<br>or not [the parents] are married to each other”). Moreover, elsewhere in the Act, Congress expressly limited&para;<br>the category of children covered to offspring of a marital&para;<br>union. See §402(d)(3)(A) (referring to the “legitimate . . .&para;<br>child” of an individual). Other contemporaneous statutes&para;<br>similarly differentiate child of a marriage (“legitimate&para;<br>child”) from the unmodified term “child.” See, e.g., Servicemen’s Dependents Allowance Act of 1942, ch. 443,&para;<br>——————&para;<br>7 Because the Court of Appeals found the statutory language unambiguous, it had no occasion to “determine whether the [SSA’s] interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute.” 631 F. 3d, at 631,&para;<br>n. 5 (citing Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,&para;<br>Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842–843 (1984)).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 566 U.

As the SSA points out, “[i]n 1939,&para;<br>there was no such thing as a scientifically proven biological relationship between a child and a father, which is . . .&para;<br>part of the reason that the word ‘biological’ appears nowhere in the Act.” Reply Brief 6. Notably, a biological&para;<br>parent is not necessarily a child’s parent under law.&para;<br>Ordinarily, “a parent-child relationship does not exist&para;<br>between an adoptee and the adoptee’s genetic parents.”&para;<br>Uniform Probate Code §2–119(a), 8 U. L. A. 55 (Supp.&para;<br>2011) (amended 2008). Moreover, laws directly addressing&para;<br>use of today’s assisted reproduction technology do not&para;<br>make biological parentage a universally determinative&para;<br>criterion. See, e.g., Cal. Fam. Code Ann. §7613(b) (West&para;<br>Supp. 2012) (“The donor of semen . . . for use in artificial&para;<br>insemination or in vitro fertilization of a woman other&para;<br>than the donor’s wife is treated in law as if he were not the&para;<br>natural father of a child thereby conceived, unless otherwise agreed to in a writing signed by the donor and the&para;<br>woman prior to the conception of the child.”); Mass. Gen.&para;<br>Laws, ch. 46, §4B (West 2010) (“Any child born to a married woman as a result of artificial insemination with the&para;<br>consent of her husband, shall be considered the legitimate&para;<br>child of the mother and such husband.”).&para;<br>We note, in addition, that marriage does not ever and&para;<br>always make the parentage of a child certain, nor does the&para;<br>absence of marriage necessarily mean that a child’s parentage is uncertain. An unmarried couple can agree that&para;<br>a child is theirs, while the parentage of a child born during&para;<br>a marriage may be uncertain. See Reply Brief 11 (“Respondent errs in treating ‘marital’ and ‘undisputed’ as&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>ASTRUE v. CAPATO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>having the same meaning.”).&para;<br>Finally, it is far from obvious that Karen Capato’s proposed definition—“biological child of married parents,” see&para;<br>Brief for Respondent 9—would cover the posthumously&para;<br>conceived Capato twins. Under Florida law, a marriage&para;<br>ends upon the death of a spouse. See Price v. Price, 114&para;<br>Fla. 233, 235, 153 So. 904, 905 (1934). If that law applies,&para;<br>rather than a court-declared preemptive federal law, the&para;<br>Capato twins, conceived after the death of their father,&para;<br>would not qualify as “marital” children.8&para;<br>B&para;<br>Resisting the importation of words not found in&para;<br>§416(e)—“child” means “the biological child of married&para;<br>parents,” Brief for Respondent 9—the SSA finds a key&para;<br>textual cue in §416(h)(2)(A)’s opening instruction: “In&para;<br>determining whether an applicant is the child . . . of [an]&para;<br>insured individual for purposes of this subchapter,” the&para;<br>Commissioner shall apply state intestacy law. (Emphasis&para;<br>added.) Respondent notes the absence of any crossreference in §416(e) to §416(h). Brief for Respondent 18.&para;<br>She overlooks, however, that §416(h) provides the crucial&para;<br>link. The “subchapter” to which §416(h) refers is Subchapter II of the Act, which spans §§401 through 434.&para;<br>Section 416(h)’s reference to “this subchapter” thus includes both §§402(d) and 416(e). Having explicitly complemented §416(e) by the definitional provisions contained&para;<br>in §416(h), Congress had no need to place a redundant&para;<br>cross-reference in §416(e). See Schafer, 641 F. 3d, at 54&para;<br>——————&para;<br>8 Respondent urges that it would be bizarre to deny benefits to the&para;<br>Capato twins when, under §416(h)(2)(B), they would have gained&para;<br>benefits had their parents gone through a marriage ceremony that&para;<br>would have been valid save for a legal impediment. Brief for Respondent 26, n. 10; see supra, at 5–6. Whether the Capatos’ marriage ceremony was flawed or flawless, the SSA counters, no marital union was&para;<br>extant when the twins were conceived.

It provided that, “[i]n determining whether an&para;<br>applicant is the . . . child . . . of [an] insured individual for&para;<br>purposes of sections 401–409 of this title, the Board shall&para;<br>apply [state intestacy law].” 42 U.

C.&para;<br>§§402(d) and 416(e) (2006 ed.), respectively.&para;<br>Reference to state law to determine an applicant’s status as a “child” is anything but anomalous. Quite the&para;<br>opposite. The Act commonly refers to state law on matters&para;<br>of family status. For example, the Act initially defines&para;<br>“wife” as “the wife of an [insured] individual,” if certain&para;<br>conditions are satisfied. §416(b). Like §416(e), §416(b)&para;<br>is, at least in part, tautological (“ ‘wife’ means the [insured’s] wife”). One must read on, although there is no express cross-reference, to §416(h) (rules on “[d]etermination&para;<br>of family status”) to complete the definition. Section&para;<br>§416(h)(1)(A) directs that, “for purposes of this subchapter,” the law of the insured’s domicile determines whether&para;<br>“[the] applicant and [the] insured individual were validly&para;<br>married,” and if they were not, whether the applicant&para;<br>would nevertheless have “the same status” as a wife under&para;<br>the State’s intestacy law. (Emphasis added.) The Act&para;<br>similarly defines the terms “widow,” “husband,” and “widower.” See §§416(c), (f), (g), (h)(1)(A).&para;<br>Indeed, as originally enacted, a single provision mandated the use of state intestacy law for “determining&para;<br>whether an applicant is the wife, widow, child, or parent of&para;<br>[an] insured individual.” 42 U. S. C. §409(m) (1940 ed.).&para;<br>All wife, widow, child, and parent applicants thus had to&para;<br>satisfy the same criterion. To be sure, children born dur-&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>ASTRUE v. CAPATO&para;<br>Opinion of the Court&para;<br>&para;<br>ing their parents’ marriage would have readily qualified&para;<br>under the 1939 formulation because of their eligibility&para;<br>to inherit under state law. But requiring all “child” applicants to qualify under state intestacy law installed a&para;<br>simple test, one that ensured benefits for persons plainly&para;<br>within the legislators’ contemplation, while avoiding congressional entanglement in the traditional state-law&para;<br>realm of family relations.&para;<br>Just as the Act generally refers to state law to determine whether an applicant qualifies as a wife, widow,&para;<br>husband, widower, 42 U. S. C. §416(h)(1) (2006 ed.), child&para;<br>or parent, §416(h)(2)(A), so in several sections (§§416(b),&para;<br>(c), (e)(2), (f), (g)), the Act sets duration-of-relationship&para;<br>limitations. See Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 777–&para;<br>782 (1975) (discussing §416(e)(2)’s requirement that, as&para;<br>a check against deathbed marriages, a parent-stepchild&para;<br>relationship must exist “not less than nine months immediately preceding [insured’s death]”). Time limits also&para;<br>qualify the statutes of several States that accord inheritance rights to posthumously conceived children. See Cal.&para;<br>Prob.

The aim&para;<br>was not to create a program “generally benefiting needy&para;<br>persons”; it was, more particularly, to “provide . . . dependent members of [a wage earner’s] family with protection against the hardship occasioned by [the] loss of [the&para;<br>insured’s] earnings.” Califano v. Jobst, 434 U. S. 47, 52&para;<br>(1977). We have recognized that “where state intestacy&para;<br>law provides that a child may take personal property from&para;<br>a father’s estate, it may reasonably be thought that the&para;<br>child will more likely be dependent during the parent’s life&para;<br>and at his death.” Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 514&para;<br>(1976). Reliance on state intestacy law to determine who&para;<br>is a “child” thus serves the Act’s driving objective.

Intestacy laws in a&para;<br>number of States, as just noted, do provide for inheritance&para;<br>by posthumously conceived children, see supra, at 12,9 and&para;<br>under federal law, a child conceived shortly before her&para;<br>father’s death may be eligible for benefits even though she&para;<br>never actually received her father’s support.

In short, the Act and regulations set different eligibility requirements for adopted&para;<br>children, stepchildren, grandchildren, and stepgrandchildren, see 20 CFR §§404.356–404.358, but it hardly follows&para;<br>that applicants in those categories are treated more advantageously than are children who must meet a §416(h)&para;<br>criterion.&para;<br>The SSA’s construction of the Act, respondent charges,&para;<br>raises serious constitutional concerns under the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause. Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 42; see Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S.&para;<br>636, 638, n. 2 (1975). She alleges: “Under the government’s interpretation . . . , posthumously conceived children are treated as an inferior subset of natural children&para;<br>who are ineligible for government benefits simply because&para;<br>of their date of birth and method of conception.” Brief for&para;<br>Respondent 42–43.&para;<br>Even the Courts of Appeals that have accepted the&para;<br>reading of the Act respondent advances have rejected this&para;<br>argument.
