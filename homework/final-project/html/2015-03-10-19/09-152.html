WYETH LLC, FKA WYETH, INC.,&para;<br>ET AL.&para;<br>CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR&para;<br>THE THIRD CIRCUIT&para;<br>No. 09–152.&para;<br>&para;<br>Argued October 12, 2010—Decided February 22, 2011&para;<br>&para;<br>The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (NCVIA or Act) cre&para;<br>ated a no-fault compensation program to stabilize a vaccine market&para;<br>adversely affected by an increase in vaccine-related tort litigation&para;<br>and to facilitate compensation to claimants who found pursuing le&para;<br>gitimate vaccine-inflicted injuries too costly and difficult. The Act&para;<br>provides that a party alleging a vaccine-related injury may file a peti&para;<br>tion for compensation in the Court of Federal Claims, naming the&para;<br>Health and Human Services Secretary as the respondent; that the&para;<br>court must resolve the case by a specified deadline; and that the&para;<br>claimant can then decide whether to accept the court’s judgment or&para;<br>reject it and seek tort relief from the vaccine manufacturer. Awards&para;<br>are paid out of a fund created by an excise tax on each vaccine dose.&para;<br>As a quid pro quo, manufacturers enjoy significant tort-liability pro&para;<br>tections. Most importantly, the Act eliminates manufacturer liability&para;<br>for a vaccine’s unavoidable, adverse side effects.&para;<br>Hannah Bruesewitz’s parents filed a vaccine-injury petition in the&para;<br>Court of Federal Claims, claiming that Hannah became disabled af&para;<br>ter receiving a diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine&para;<br>manufactured by Lederle Laboratories (now owned by respondent&para;<br>Wyeth). After that court denied their claim, they elected to reject the&para;<br>unfavorable judgment and filed suit in Pennsylvania state court, al&para;<br>leging, inter alia, that the defective design of Lederle’s DTP vaccine&para;<br>caused Hannah’s disabilities, and that Lederle was subject to strict&para;<br>liability and liability for negligent design under Pennsylvania com&para;<br>mon law. Wyeth removed the suit to the Federal District Court. It&para;<br>granted Wyeth summary judgment, holding that the relevant Penn&para;<br>sylvania law was preempted by 42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(b)(1), which&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>provides that “[n]o vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil ac&para;<br>tion for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death asso&para;<br>ciated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if&para;<br>the injury or death resulted from side-effects that were unavoidable&para;<br>even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied&para;<br>by proper directions and warnings.” The Third Circuit affirmed.&para;<br>&para;<br>Held: The NCVIA preempts all design-defect claims against vaccine&para;<br>manufacturers brought by plaintiffs seeking compensation for injury&para;<br>or death caused by a vaccine’s side effects. Pp. 7–19.&para;<br>(a) Section 300aa–22(b)(1)’s text suggests that a vaccine’s design is&para;<br>not open to question in a tort action. If a manufacturer could be held&para;<br>liable for failure to use a different design, the “even though” clause&para;<br>would do no work. A vaccine side effect could always have been&para;<br>avoidable by use of a different vaccine not containing the harmful&para;<br>element. The language of the provision thus suggests the design is&para;<br>not subject to question in a tort action. What the statute establishes&para;<br>as a complete defense must be unavoidability (given safe manufac&para;<br>ture and warning) with respect to the particular design. This conclu&para;<br>sion is supported by the fact that, although products-liability law es&para;<br>tablishes three grounds for liability—defective manufacture,&para;<br>inadequate directions or warnings, and defective design—the Act&para;<br>mentions only manufacture and warnings. It thus seems that the&para;<br>Act’s failure to mention design-defect liability is “by deliberate choice,&para;<br>not inadvertence.” Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S. 149, 168.&para;<br>Pp. 7–8.&para;<br>(b) Contrary to petitioners’ argument, there is no reason to believe&para;<br>that §300aa–22(b)(1)’s term “unavoidable” is a term of art incorporat&para;<br>ing Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A, Comment k, which exempts&para;<br>from strict liability rules “unavoidably unsafe products.” “Unavoid&para;<br>able” is hardly a rarely used word, and cases interpreting comment k&para;<br>attach special significance only to the term “unavoidably unsafe&para;<br>products,” not the word “unavoidable” standing alone. Moreover,&para;<br>reading the phrase “side effects that were unavoidable” to exempt in&para;<br>juries caused by flawed design would require treating “even though”&para;<br>as a coordinating conjunction linking independent ideas when it is a&para;<br>concessive, subordinating conjunction conveying that one clause&para;<br>weakens or qualifies the other. The canon against superfluity does&para;<br>not undermine this Court’s interpretation because petitioners’ com&para;<br>peting interpretation has superfluity problems of its own. Pp. 8–12.&para;<br>(c) The structure of the NCVIA and of vaccine regulation in general&para;<br>reinforces what §300aa–22(b)(1)’s text suggests. Design defects do&para;<br>not merit a single mention in the Act or in Food and Drug Admini&para;<br>stration regulations that pervasively regulate the drug manufactur&para;<br>ing process. This lack of guidance for design defects, combined with&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U. S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Syllabus&para;<br>the extensive guidance for the two liability grounds specifically men&para;<br>tioned in the Act, strongly suggests that design defects were not men&para;<br>tioned because they are not a basis for liability. The Act’s mandates&para;<br>lead to the same conclusion. It provides for federal agency improve&para;<br>ment of vaccine design and for federally prescribed compensation,&para;<br>which are other means for achieving the two beneficial effects of de&para;<br>sign-defect torts—prompting the development of improved designs,&para;<br>and providing compensation for inflicted injuries. The Act’s struc&para;<br>tural quid pro quo also leads to the same conclusion. The vaccine&para;<br>manufacturers fund an informal, efficient compensation program for&para;<br>vaccine injuries in exchange for avoiding costly tort litigation and the&para;<br>occasional disproportionate jury verdict. Taxing their product to fund&para;<br>the compensation program, while leaving their liability for design de&para;<br>fect virtually unaltered, would hardly coax them back into the mar&para;<br>ket.

It delineates the preventative measures that a vaccine&para;<br>manufacturer must have taken for a side-effect to be con&para;<br>sidered “unavoidable” under the statute.

The phrase “even though” in the clause&para;<br>“even though the vaccine was properly prepared and&para;<br>[labeled]” is meant to signal the unexpected: unavoidable&para;<br>side effects persist despite best manufacturing and label&para;<br>ing practices.43 But petitioners’ reading eliminates any&para;<br>opposition between the “even though” clause—called a&para;<br>concessive subordinate clause by grammarians—and the&para;<br>word “unavoidable.”44 Their reading makes preemption&para;<br>turn equally on unavoidability, proper preparation, and&para;<br>proper labeling. Thus, the dissent twice refers to the&para;<br>requirements of proper preparation and proper labeling as&para;<br>“two additional prerequisites” for preemption independent&para;<br>of unavoidability.45 The primary textual justification for&para;<br>the dissent’s position depends on that independence.46&para;<br>But linking independent ideas is the job of a coordinating&para;<br>junction like “and,” not a subordinating junction like “even&para;<br>though.”47&para;<br>——————&para;<br>43 The dissent’s assertion that we treat “even though” as a synonym&para;<br>for “because” misses the subtle distinction between “because” and&para;<br>“despite.” See post, at 17, n. 14. “Even though” is a close cousin of the&para;<br>latter. See Webster’s New International Dictionary 709, 2631 (2d ed.&para;<br>1957). The statement “the car accident was unavoidable despite his&para;<br>quick reflexes” indicates that quick reflexes could not avoid the acci&para;<br>dent, and leaves open two unstated possibilities: (1) that other, un&para;<br>stated means of avoiding the accident besides quick reflexes existed,&para;<br>but came up short as well; or (2) that quick reflexes were the only&para;<br>possible way to avoid the accident. Our interpretation of §300aa–&para;<br>22(b)(1) explains why we think Congress meant the latter in this&para;<br>context.

The rule applies only if ver&para;<br>bosity and prolixity can be eliminated by giving the offend&para;<br>ing passage, or the remainder of the text, a competing&para;<br>interpretation. That is not the case here.48 To be sure,&para;<br>petitioners’ and the dissent’s interpretation gives inde&para;<br>pendent meaning to the intervening passage (the supposed&para;<br>meaning of comment k); but it does so only at the expense&para;<br>of rendering the remainder of the provision superfluous.&para;<br>Since a vaccine is not “quite incapable of being made safer&para;<br>for [its] intended use” if manufacturing defects could have&para;<br>been eliminated or better warnings provided, the entire&para;<br>“even though” clause is a useless appendage.49 It would&para;<br>suffice to say “if the injury or death resulted from side&para;<br>effects that were unavoidable”—full stop.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>performed by “and.” No, we think “even though” has a distinctive&para;<br>concessive, subordinating role to play.&para;<br>48 Because the dissent has a superfluity problem of its own, its reli&para;<br>ance on Bates v.

Section 22(a) sets&para;<br>forth the “[g]eneral rule” that “State law shall apply to a&para;<br>civil action brought for damages for a vaccine-related&para;<br>injury or death.” §300aa–22(a). This baseline rule that&para;<br>state law applies is subject to three narrow exceptions, one&para;<br>of which, §22(b)(1), is at issue in this case. Section 22(b)(1)&para;<br>provides:&para;<br>“No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil ac&para;<br>tion for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury&para;<br>or death associated with the administration of a vac&para;<br>cine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death re&para;<br>sulted from side effects that were unavoidable even&para;<br>though the vaccine was properly prepared and was&para;<br>accompanied by proper directions and warnings.”&para;<br>§300aa–22(b)(1).&para;<br>The provision contains two key clauses: “if the injury or&para;<br>death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable”&para;<br>(the “if ” clause), and “even though the vaccine was prop&para;<br>erly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions&para;<br>and warnings” (the “even though” clause).&para;<br>Blackletter products liability law generally recognizes&para;<br>three different types of product defects: design defects,&para;<br>manufacturing defects, and labeling defects (e.g., failure to&para;<br>warn).1 The reference in the “even though” clause to a&para;<br>“properly prepared” vaccine “accompanied by proper direc&para;<br>tions and warnings” is an obvious reference to two such&para;<br>defects—manufacturing and labeling defects.

Because §22(b)(1) is invoked by vaccine manufactur&para;<br>ers as a defense to tort liability, it follows that the “even&para;<br>though” clause requires a vaccine manufacturer in each&para;<br>civil action to demonstrate that its vaccine is free from&para;<br>manufacturing and labeling defects to fall within the&para;<br>liability exemption of §22(b)(1).2&para;<br>Given that the “even though” clause requires the ab&para;<br>sence of manufacturing and labeling defects, the “if ”&para;<br>clause’s reference to “side effects that were unavoidable”&para;<br>must refer to side effects caused by something other than&para;<br>manufacturing and labeling defects. The only remaining&para;<br>kind of product defect recognized under traditional prod&para;<br>ucts liability law is a design defect. Thus, “side effects&para;<br>that were unavoidable” must refer to side effects caused by&para;<br>a vaccine’s design that were “unavoidable.” Because&para;<br>§22(b)(1) uses the conditional term “if,” moreover, the text&para;<br>plainly implies that some side effects stemming from a&para;<br>vaccine’s design are “unavoidable,” while others are avoid&para;<br>able.

Accordingly, because the “if ” clause&para;<br>(like the “even though” clause) sets forth a condition to&para;<br>invoke §22(b)(1)’s defense to tort liability, Congress must&para;<br>also have intended a vaccine manufacturer to demonstrate&para;<br>in each civil action that the particular side effects of a&para;<br>vaccine’s design were “unavoidable.”&para;<br>Congress’ use of conditional “if” clauses in two other&para;<br>provisions of the Vaccine Act supports the conclusion that&para;<br>§22(b)(1) requires an inquiry in each case in which a&para;<br>manufacturer seeks to invoke the provision’s exception to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>2 See Silkwood v.

There are some products which, in&para;<br>the present state of human knowledge, are quite incapable of being&para;<br>made safe for their intended and ordinary use.

An outstanding example is the vaccine&para;<br>for the Pasteur treatment of rabies, which not uncommonly leads to&para;<br>very serious and damaging consequences when it is injected.

Such a product,&para;<br>properly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions and warning,&para;<br>is not defective, nor is it unreasonably dangerous. The same is true of&para;<br>many other drugs, vaccines, and the like, many of which for this very&para;<br>reason cannot legally be sold except to physicians, or under the pre&para;<br>scription of a physician. It is also true in particular of many new or&para;<br>experimental drugs as to which, because of lack of time and opportunity&para;<br>for sufficient medical experience, there can be no assurance of safety, or&para;<br>perhaps even of purity of ingredients, but such experience as there is&para;<br>justifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding a medically&para;<br>recognizable risk.

Searle Labs., 884&para;<br>F. 2d 1064, 1068 (CA8 1989) (collecting cases), but as indicated by the&para;<br>sources cited above, the courts that had construed comment k to apply&para;<br>on a case-specific basis generally agreed on the basic elements of what&para;<br>constituted an “unavoidably unsafe” product. See also n. 8, infra. The&para;<br>majority’s suggestion that “judges who must rule on motions to dismiss,&para;<br>motions for summary judgment, and motions for judgment as a matter&para;<br>of law” are incapable of adjudicating claims alleging “unavoidable” side&para;<br>effects, ante, at 7–8, n. 35, is thus belied by the experience of the many&para;<br>courts that had adjudicated such claims for years by the time of the&para;<br>Vaccine Act’s enactment.&para;<br>6 The majority refuses to recognize that “unavoidable” is a term of art&para;<br>derived from comment k, suggesting that “ ‘[u]navoidable’ is hardly a&para;<br>rarely used word.” Ante, at 10. In fact, however, “unavoidable” is an&para;<br>extremely rare word in the relevant context. It appears exactly once&para;<br>(i.e., in §300aa–22(b)(1)) in the entirety of Title 42 of the U. S.

The Report makes clear that “side effects&para;<br>that were unavoidable” in §22(b)(1) refers to side effects&para;<br>stemming from a vaccine’s design that were “unavoidable.”&para;<br>By explaining what Congress meant by the term “un&para;<br>avoidable,” moreover, the Report also confirms that&para;<br>whether a side effect is “unavoidable” for purposes of&para;<br>§22(b)(1) involves a specific inquiry in each case as to&para;<br>whether the vaccine “in the present state of human skill&para;<br>and knowledge cannot be made safe,” 1986 Report 26—i.e.,&para;<br>whether a feasible alternative design existed that would&para;<br>have eliminated the adverse side effects of the vaccine&para;<br>without compromising its cost and utility.

The concurrence makes a similar&para;<br>argument. Ante, at 1–2 (opinion of BREYER, J.). This interpretation&para;<br>finds some support in the 1986 Report, which states that “if [injured&para;<br>individuals] cannot demonstrate under applicable law either that a&para;<br>vaccine was improperly prepared or that it was accompanied by im&para;<br>proper directions or inadequate warnings [they] should pursue recom&para;<br>pense in the compensation system, not the tort system.” 1986 Report&para;<br>26. It also finds some support in the pre-Vaccine Act case law, which&para;<br>reflected considerable disagreement in the courts over “whether com&para;<br>ment k applies to pharmaceutical products across the board or only on&para;<br>a case-by-case basis.” Ausness, Unavoidably Unsafe Products and&para;<br>Strict Products Liability: What Liability Rule Should be Applied to the&para;<br>Sellers of Pharmaceutical Products? 78 Ky. L. J. 705, 708, and n. 11&para;<br>(1989–1990) (collecting cases). This interpretation, however, is under&para;<br>mined by the fact that Congress has never directed the Food and Drug&para;<br>Administration (FDA) or any other federal agency to review vaccines&para;<br>for optimal vaccine design, see infra, at 20–22, and n. 19, and thus it&para;<br>seems highly unlikely that Congress intended to eliminate the tradi&para;<br>tional mechanism for such review (i.e., design defect liability), particu&para;<br>larly given its express retention of state tort law in the Vaccine Act, see&para;<br>42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(a). In any event, to the extent there is ambiguity&para;<br>as to how precisely Congress intended the “principle in Comment K” to&para;<br>apply to the covered vaccines, that ambiguity is explicitly resolved in&para;<br>petitioners’ favor by the 1987 House Energy and Commerce Committee&para;<br>Report, H.

In 1987, Con&para;<br>gress passed legislation to fund the compensation pro&para;<br>gram. The House Energy and Commerce Committee&para;<br>Report9 accompanying that legislation specifically stated&para;<br>that “the codification of Comment (k) of The Restatement&para;<br>(Second) of Torts was not intended to decide as a matter of&para;<br>law the circumstances in which a vaccine should be&para;<br>deemed unavoidably unsafe.” Id., at 691.

In light of that&para;<br>rejection, the Committee emphasized that “there should be&para;<br>no misunderstanding that the Act undertook to decide as a&para;<br>matter of law whether vaccines were unavoidably unsafe&para;<br>or not,” and that “[t]his question is left to the courts to&para;<br>determine in accordance with applicable law.” Ibid.&para;<br>To be sure, postenactment legislative history created by&para;<br>a subsequent Congress is ordinarily a hazardous basis&para;<br>from which to infer the intent of the enacting Congress.&para;<br>See Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617, 631–632 (1990)&para;<br>(SCALIA, J., concurring in part). But unlike ordinary&para;<br>postenactment legislative history, which is justifiably&para;<br>given little or no weight, the 1987 Report reflects the&para;<br>intent of the Congress that enacted the funding legislation&para;<br>necessary to give operative effect to the principal provi&para;<br>sions of the Vaccine Act, including §22(b)(1).10 Congress in&para;<br>——————&para;<br>9 The Third Circuit’s opinion below expressed uncertainty as to&para;<br>whether the 1987 Report was authored by the House Budget Commit&para;<br>tee or the House Energy and Commerce Committee. See 561 F. 3d 233,&para;<br>250 (2009). As petitioners explain, although the Budget Committee&para;<br>compiled and issued the Report, the Energy and Commerce Committee&para;<br>wrote and approved the relevant language. Title IV of the Report,&para;<br>entitled “Committee on Energy and Commerce,” comprises “two Com&para;<br>mittee Prints approved by the Committee on Energy and Commerce for&para;<br>inclusion in the forthcoming reconciliation bill.” 1987 Report 377, 380.&para;<br>10 The majority suggests that the 1987 legislation creating the fund&para;<br>&para;<br>12&para;<br>&para;<br>BRUESEWITZ v.

Because the tort reforms in the 1986&para;<br>Act, including §22(b)(1), had no operative legal effect&para;<br>unless and until Congress provided funding for the com&para;<br>pensation program, the views of the Congress that enacted&para;<br>that funding legislation are a proper and, indeed, authori&para;<br>tative guide to the meaning of §22(b)(1).

First, the majority’s categorical reading rests on a&para;<br>faulty and untenable premise. Second, its reading func&para;<br>tionally excises 13 words from the statutory text, including&para;<br>the key term “unavoidable.” And third, the majority en&para;<br>tirely ignores the Vaccine Act’s default rule preserving&para;<br>state tort law.&para;<br>To begin, the majority states that “[a] side effect of a&para;<br>vaccine could always have been avoidable by use of a&para;<br>differently designed vaccine not containing the harmful&para;<br>element.” Ante, at 7. From that premise, the majority&para;<br>concludes that the statute must mean that “the design of&para;<br>the vaccine is a given, not subject to question in the tort&para;<br>action,” because construing the statute otherwise would&para;<br>&para;<br>14&para;<br>&para;<br>BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>render §22(b)(1) a nullity. Ibid. A tort claimant, accord&para;<br>ing to the majority, will always be able to point to a differ&para;<br>ently designed vaccine not containing the “harmful ele&para;<br>ment,” and if that were sufficient to show that a vaccine’s&para;<br>side effects were not “unavoidable,” the statute would pre&para;<br>empt nothing.&para;<br>The starting premise of the majority’s interpretation,&para;<br>however, is fatally flawed. Although in the most literal&para;<br>sense, as the majority notes, a side effect can always be&para;<br>avoided “by use of a differently designed vaccine not con&para;<br>taining the harmful element,” ibid., this interpretation of&para;<br>“unavoidable” would effectively read the term out of the&para;<br>statute, and Congress could not have intended that result.&para;<br>Indeed, §22(b)(1) specifically uses the conditional phrase&para;<br>“if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were&para;<br>unavoidable,” which plainly indicates that Congress con&para;<br>templated that there would be some instances in which a&para;<br>vaccine’s side effects are “unavoidable” and other in&para;<br>stances in which they are not. See supra, at 3. The major&para;<br>ity’s premise that a vaccine’s side effects can always be&para;<br>“avoid[ed] by use of a differently designed vaccine not&para;<br>containing the harmful element,” ante, at 7, entirely ig&para;<br>nores the fact that removing the “harmful element” will&para;<br>often result in a less effective (or entirely ineffective)&para;<br>vaccine. A vaccine, by its nature, ordinarily employs a&para;<br>killed or weakened form of a bacteria or virus to stimulate&para;<br>antibody production;13 removing that bacteria or virus&para;<br>might remove the “harmful element,” but it would also&para;<br>necessarily render the vaccine inert.

If Congress intended to exempt vaccine&para;<br>manufacturers categorically from all design defect liabil&para;<br>ity, it more logically would have provided: “No vaccine&para;<br>manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages&para;<br>arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated&para;<br>with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988,&para;<br>if the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied&para;<br>by proper directions and warnings.” There would have&para;<br>been no need for Congress to include the additional 13&para;<br>words “the injury or death resulted from side effects that&para;<br>were unavoidable even though.” See TRW Inc. v. An&para;<br>drews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001) (noting “cardinal principle&para;<br>of statutory construction that a statute ought, upon the&para;<br>whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no&para;<br>clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or&para;<br>insignificant” (internal quotation marks omitted)).&para;<br>In Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431 (2005),&para;<br>this Court considered an analogous situation where an&para;<br>express pre-emption provision stated that certain States&para;<br>“ ‘shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements&para;<br>for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from&para;<br>those required under this subchapter.’ ” Id., at 436 (quot&para;<br>ing 7 U.

See&para;<br>ante, at 12 (“The intervening passage (‘the injury or death&para;<br>resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even&para;<br>though’) is unnecessary. True enough”). Nevertheless, the&para;<br>majority contends that “the rule against giving a portion of&para;<br>text an interpretation which renders it superfluous . . .&para;<br>applies only if verbosity and prolixity can be eliminated by&para;<br>giving the offending passage, or the remainder of the text,&para;<br>a competing interpretation.” Ibid. According to the major&para;<br>ity, petitioners’ reading of §22(b)(1) renders the “even&para;<br>though” clause superfluous because, to reach petitioners’&para;<br>desired outcome, “[i]t would suffice to say ‘if the injury or&para;<br>death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable’—&para;<br>full stop.” Ibid. As explained above, however, the “even&para;<br>though” clause establishes two additional prerequisites—&para;<br>proper manufacturing and proper labeling—to qualify for&para;<br>§22(b)(1)’s exemption from liability. Contrary to the ma&para;<br>jority’s contention, then, the “even though” clause serves&para;<br>an important function by limiting the scope of the pre&para;<br>emption afforded by the preceding “if ” clause.14&para;<br>The majority’s only other textual argument is based on&para;<br>——————&para;<br>14 In this manner, the “even though” clause functions in a “concessive&para;<br>subordinat[ing]” fashion, ante, at 11, in accord with normal grammati&para;<br>cal usage. According to the majority, however, the “even though” clause&para;<br>“clarifies the word that precedes it” by “delineat[ing]” the conditions&para;<br>that make a side effect “unavoidable” under the statute. Ante, at 7.&para;<br>The majority’s interpretation hardly treats the clause as “concessive,”&para;<br>and indeed strains the meaning of “even though.” In the majority’s&para;<br>view, proper manufacturing and labeling are the sole prerequisites that&para;<br>render a vaccine’s side effects unavoidable. Thus, an injurious side&para;<br>effect is unavoidable because the vaccine was properly prepared and&para;<br>labeled, not “even though” it was. The two conjunctions are not equiva&para;<br>lent: The sentence “I am happy even though it is raining” can hardly be&para;<br>read to mean that “I am happy because it is raining.” In any event, the&para;<br>more fundamental point is that petitioners’ interpretation actually&para;<br>gives meaning to the words “even though,” whereas the majority&para;<br>concedes that its interpretation effectively reads those words entirely&para;<br>out of the statute.

According to&para;<br>the majority, because blackletter products liability law&para;<br>generally recognizes three different types of product de&para;<br>fects, “[i]f all three were intended to be preserved, it would&para;<br>be strange [for Congress] to mention specifically only&para;<br>two”—namely, manufacturing and labeling defects in the&para;<br>“even though” clause—“and leave the third to implication.”&para;<br>Ante, at 8. The majority’s argument, however, ignores&para;<br>that the default rule under the Vaccine Act is that state&para;<br>law is preserved. As explained above, §22(a) expressly&para;<br>provides that the “[g]eneral rule” is that “State law shall&para;<br>apply to a civil action brought for damages for a vaccine&para;<br>related injury or death.” 42 U. S. C. §300aa–22(a). Be&para;<br>cause §22(a) already preserves state-law design defect&para;<br>claims (to the extent the exemption in §22(b)(1) does not&para;<br>apply), there was no need for Congress separately and&para;<br>expressly to preserve design defect claims in §22(b)(1).&para;<br>Indeed, Congress’ principal aim in enacting §22(b)(1) was&para;<br>not to preserve manufacturing and labeling claims (those,&para;<br>too, were already preserved by §22(a)), but rather, to&para;<br>federalize comment k-type protection for “unavoidably&para;<br>unsafe” vaccines. The “even though” clause simply func&para;<br>tions to limit the applicability of that defense. The lack of&para;<br>express language in §22(b)(1) specifically preserving de&para;<br>sign defect claims thus cannot fairly be understood as&para;<br>impliedly (and categorically) pre-empting such traditional&para;<br>state tort claims, which had already been preserved by&para;<br>§22(a).15&para;<br>——————&para;<br>15 This&para;<br>&para;<br>Court, moreover, has long operated on “the assumption that&para;<br>the historic police powers of the States are not to be superseded by the&para;<br>Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Con&para;<br>gress.” Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at&para;<br>5) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Given the long&para;<br>history of state regulation of vaccines, see Brief for Petitioners 3–6, the&para;<br>presumption provides an additional reason not to read §22(b)(1) as pre&para;<br>empting all design defect claims, especially given Congress’ inclusion of&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 562 U.

Putting aside the fact that §22(a) already preserves&para;<br>design defect claims (to the extent §22(b)(1) does not ap&para;<br>ply), the majority’s proposed solution would not have fully&para;<br>effectuated Congress’ intent.

At the time of the Vaccine Act’s enact&para;<br>ment in 1986, at least one State had expressly rejected&para;<br>comment k,16 while many others had not addressed the&para;<br>applicability of comment k specifically to vaccines or ap&para;<br>plied comment k to civil actions proceeding on a theory&para;<br>other than strict liability (e.g., negligence17).

Ante, at 13. The flaw in that rea&para;<br>soning, of course, is that the FDA’s silence on design de&para;<br>fects existed long before the Vaccine Act was enacted.&para;<br>Indeed, the majority itself concedes that the “FDA has&para;<br>never even spelled out in regulations the criteria it uses to&para;<br>decide whether a vaccine is safe and effective for its in&para;<br>tended use.”18 Ibid.

But&para;<br>the majority’s position elides a significant difference be&para;<br>tween state tort law and the federal regulatory scheme.&para;<br>Although the Vaccine Act charges the Secretary of Health&para;<br>and Human Services with the obligation to “promote the&para;<br>development of childhood vaccines” and “make or assure&para;<br>improvements in . . . vaccines, and research on vaccines,”&para;<br>§300aa–27(a), neither the Act nor any other provision of&para;<br>federal law places a legal duty on vaccine manufacturers&para;<br>to improve the design of their vaccines to account for&para;<br>scientific and technological advances.

As the legislative history indicates, the&para;<br>Act addressed “two overriding concerns”: “(a) the inade&para;<br>quacy—from both the perspective of vaccine-injured per&para;<br>sons as well as vaccine manufacturers—of the current&para;<br>approach to compensating those who have been damaged&para;<br>by a vaccine; and (b) the instability and unpredictability of&para;<br>the childhood vaccine market.” 1986 Report 7. When&para;<br>viewed in the context of the Vaccine Act as a whole,&para;<br>§22(b)(1) is just one part of a broader statutory scheme&para;<br>that balances the need for compensating vaccine-injured&para;<br>children with added liability protections for vaccine manu&para;<br>facturers to ensure a stable childhood vaccine market.&para;<br>The principal innovation of the Act was the creation of&para;<br>the no-fault compensation program—a scheme funded&para;<br>entirely through an excise tax on vaccines.22 Through that&para;<br>——————&para;<br>that Congress intended sub silentio to displace a longstanding species&para;<br>of state tort liability where, as here, Congress specifically included an&para;<br>express saving clause preserving state law, there is a long history of&para;<br>state-law regulation of vaccine design, and pre-emption of state law&para;<br>would leave an important regulatory function—i.e., ensuring optimal&para;<br>vaccine design—entirely unaddressed by the congressional substitute.&para;<br>22 The majority’s suggestion that “vaccine manufacturers fund from&para;<br>their sales” the compensation program is misleading.

The structure and legislative history,&para;<br>moreover, point clearly to Congress’ intention to divert&para;<br>would-be tort claimants into the compensation program,&para;<br>rather than eliminate a longstanding category of tradi&para;<br>tional tort claims. See 1986 Report 13 (“The Committee&para;<br>anticipates that the speed of the compensation program,&para;<br>the low transaction costs of the system, the no-fault na&para;<br>ture of the required findings, and the relative certainty&para;<br>and generosity of the system’s awards will divert a signifi&para;<br>cant number of potential plaintiffs from litigation”). In&para;<br>deed, although complete pre-emption of tort claims would&para;<br>have eliminated the principal source of the “unpredictabil&para;<br>ity” in the vaccine market, Congress specifically chose not&para;<br>to pre-empt state tort claims categorically.

Congress thus clearly believed there&para;<br>was still an important function to be played by state tort&para;<br>law.&para;<br>Instead of eliminating design defect liability entirely,&para;<br>Congress enacted numerous measures to reduce manufac&para;<br>turers’ liability exposure, including a limited regulatory&para;<br>compliance presumption of adequate warnings, see&para;<br>§300aa–22(b)(2), elimination of claims based on failure&para;<br>to provide direct warnings to patients, §300aa–22(c), a&para;<br>heightened standard for punitive damages, §300aa–&para;<br>23(d)(2), and, of course, immunity from damages for “un&para;<br>avoidable” side effects, §300aa–22(b)(1). Considered in&para;<br>light of the Vaccine Act as a whole, §22(b)(1)’s exemption&para;<br>from liability for unavoidably unsafe vaccines is just one&para;<br>part of a broader statutory scheme that reflects Congress’&para;<br>careful balance between providing adequate compensation&para;<br>for vaccine-injured children and conferring substantial&para;<br>benefits on vaccine manufacturers to ensure a stable and&para;<br>predictable childhood vaccine supply.&para;<br>The majority’s decision today disturbs that careful&para;<br>balance based on a bare policy preference that it is better&para;<br>“to leave complex epidemiological judgments about vaccine&para;<br>design to the FDA and the National Vaccine Program&para;<br>rather than juries.” Ante, at 15.24 To be sure, reasonable&para;<br>minds can disagree about the wisdom of having juries&para;<br>weigh the relative costs and benefits of a particular vac&para;<br>cine design.

S. ____ (2011)&para;<br>&para;<br>27&para;<br>&para;<br>SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting&para;<br>&para;<br>policy preference, the decision to bar all design defect&para;<br>claims against vaccine manufacturers is one that Congress&para;<br>must make, not this Court.25 By construing §22(b)(1) to&para;<br>——————&para;<br>25 Respondent notes that there are some 5,000 petitions alleging a&para;<br>causal link between certain vaccines and autism spectrum disorders&para;<br>that are currently pending in an omnibus proceeding in the Court of&para;<br>Federal Claims (Vaccine Court). Brief for Respondent 56–57. Accord&para;<br>ing to respondent, a ruling that §22(b)(1) does not pre-empt design&para;<br>defect claims could unleash a “crushing wave” of tort litigation that&para;<br>would bankrupt vaccine manufacturers and deplete vaccine supply.&para;<br>Id., at 28. This concern underlies many of the policy arguments in&para;<br>respondent’s brief and appears to underlie the majority and concurring&para;<br>opinions in this case. In the absence of any empirical data, however,&para;<br>the prospect of an onslaught of autism-related tort litigation by claim&para;<br>ants denied relief by the Vaccine Court seems wholly speculative. As&para;<br>an initial matter, the special masters in the autism cases have thus far&para;<br>uniformly rejected the alleged causal link between vaccines and autism.&para;<br>See Brief for American Academy of Pediatrics et al. as Amici Curiae&para;<br>20–21, n. 4 (collecting cases). To be sure, those rulings do not necessar&para;<br>ily mean that no such causal link exists, cf. Brief for United States as&para;<br>Amicus Curiae 29 (noting that injuries have been added to the Vaccine&para;<br>Injury Table for existing vaccines), or that claimants will not ultimately&para;<br>be able to prove such a link in a state tort action, particularly with the&para;<br>added tool of civil discovery. But these rulings do highlight the sub&para;<br>stantial hurdles to recovery a claimant faces. See Schafer v. American&para;<br>Cyanamid Co., 20 F. 3d 1, 5 (CA1 1994) (“[A] petitioner to whom the&para;<br>Vaccine Court gives nothing may see no point in trying to overcome tort&para;<br>law’s yet more serious obstacles to recovery”). Trial courts, moreover,&para;<br>have considerable experience in efficiently handling and disposing of&para;<br>meritless products liability claims, and decades of tort litigation (in&para;<br>cluding for design defect) in the prescription-drug context have not led&para;<br>to shortages in prescription drugs. Despite the doomsday predictions of&para;<br>respondent and the various amici cited by the concurrence, ante, at 6–7,&para;<br>the possibility of a torrent of meritless lawsuits bankrupting manufac&para;<br>turers and causing vaccine shortages seems remote at best. More&para;<br>fundamentally, whatever the merits of these policy arguments, the&para;<br>issue in this case is what Congress has decided, and as to that question,&para;<br>the text, structure, and legislative history compel the conclusion that&para;<br>Congress intended to leave the courthouse doors open for children who&para;<br>have suffered severe injuries from defectively designed vaccines. The&para;<br>majority’s policy-driven decision to the contrary usurps Congress’ role&para;<br>and deprives such vaccine-injured children of a key remedy that Con&para;<br>gress intended them to have.&para;<br>&para;<br>28&para;<br>&para;<br>BRUESEWITZ v.
