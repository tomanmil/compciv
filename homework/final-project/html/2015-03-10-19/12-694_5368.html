CALVIN&para;<br>&para;<br>O’NEIL JACKSON&para;<br>&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED &para;<br>&para;<br>STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 12–694.&para;<br>&para;<br>Decided June 3, 2013&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>In this case, the Court of Appeals held that respondent,&para;<br>who was convicted of rape and other serious crimes, is entitled to relief under the federal habeas statute because&para;<br>the Supreme Court of Nevada unreasonably applied clearly&para;<br>established Supreme Court precedent regarding a criminal defendant’s constitutional right to present a defense.&para;<br>At his trial, respondent unsuccessfully sought to introduce&para;<br>evidence for the purpose of showing that the rape victim&para;<br>previously reported that he had assaulted her but that&para;<br>the police had been unable to substantiate those allegations. The state supreme court held that this evidence&para;<br>was properly excluded, and no prior decision of this Court&para;<br>clearly establishes that the exclusion of this evidence&para;<br>violated respondent’s federal constitutional rights. The&para;<br>decision of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed.&para;<br>I&para;<br>Respondent Calvin Jackson had a tumultuous decadelong romantic relationship with Annette Heathmon. In&para;<br>1998, after several previous attempts to end the relationship, Heathmon relocated to a new apartment in North&para;<br>Las Vegas without telling respondent where she was moving. Respondent learned of Heathmon’s whereabouts,&para;<br>and on the night of October 21, 1998, he visited her&para;<br>apartment. What happened next was the focus of respondent’s trial.&para;<br>Heathmon told police and later testified that respondent&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>NEVADA v. JACKSON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>forced his way into her apartment and threatened to kill&para;<br>her with a screwdriver if she did not have sex with him.&para;<br>After raping Heathmon, respondent hit her, stole a ring&para;<br>from her bedroom, and dragged her out of the apartment&para;<br>and toward his car by the neck and hair. A witness confronted the couple, and respondent fled. Police observed&para;<br>injuries to Heathmon’s neck and scalp that were consistent with her account of events, and respondent was eventually arrested.&para;<br>Although respondent did not testify at trial, he discussed Heathmon’s allegations with police shortly after his&para;<br>arrest, and his statements were admitted into evidence&para;<br>at trial. Respondent acknowledged that Heathmon might&para;<br>have agreed to have sex because the two were alone and&para;<br>“she was scared that [he] might do something,” Tr. 305,&para;<br>but he claimed that the sex was consensual. Respondent&para;<br>also admitted striking Heathmon inside the apartment&para;<br>but denied pulling her outside by the neck and hair.&para;<br>Shortly before trial, Heathmon sent the judge a letter&para;<br>recanting her prior accusations and stating that she would&para;<br>not testify. She went into hiding, but police eventually&para;<br>found her and took her into custody as a material witness. Once in custody, Heathmon disavowed the letter and&para;<br>agreed to testify. When asked about the letter at trial, she&para;<br>stated that three of respondent’s associates had forced her&para;<br>to write it and had threatened to hurt her if she appeared&para;<br>in court.&para;<br>At trial, the theory of the defense was that Heathmon&para;<br>had fabricated the sexual assault and had reported it to&para;<br>police in an effort to control respondent. To support that&para;<br>theory, the defense sought to introduce testimony and&para;<br>police reports showing that Heathmon had called the&para;<br>police on several prior occasions claiming that respondent&para;<br>had raped or otherwise assaulted her. Police were unable&para;<br>to corroborate many of these prior allegations, and in&para;<br>several cases they were skeptical of her claims. Although&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>3&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>the trial court gave the defense wide latitude to crossexamine Heathmon about those prior incidents, it refused&para;<br>to admit the police reports or to allow the defense to call as&para;<br>witnesses the officers involved. The jury found respondent&para;<br>guilty, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.&para;<br>Respondent appealed his conviction to the Nevada Supreme Court, arguing, among other things, that the trial&para;<br>court’s refusal to admit extrinsic evidence relating to the&para;<br>prior incidents violated his federal constitutional right&para;<br>to present a complete defense, but the Nevada Supreme&para;<br>Court rejected that argument.&para;<br>After exhausting his remedies in state court, respondent&para;<br>filed a federal habeas petition, again arguing that the trial&para;<br>court’s ruling had violated his right to present a defense.&para;<br>Applying AEDPA’s deferential standard of review, the&para;<br>District Court denied relief, but a divided panel of the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit reversed. 688 F. 3d 1091 (2012). The majority held that extrinsic evidence of Heathmon’s prior allegations was critical to respondent’s defense, that the&para;<br>exclusion of that evidence violated respondent’s constitutional right to present a defense, and that the Nevada&para;<br>Supreme Court’s decision to the contrary was an unreasonable application of this Court’s precedents. Id., at&para;<br>1097–1101. Although it acknowledged that the state court&para;<br>had ruled that the evidence was inadmissible as a matter&para;<br>of state law, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the impact&para;<br>of the State’s rules of evidence on the defense “was disproportionate to the state’s interest in . . . exclusion.” Id., at&para;<br>1101–1104. Finding that the trial court’s erroneous evidentiary ruling was not harmless, id., at 1104–1106, the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit ordered the State either to retry or to release respondent.&para;<br>II&para;<br>The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of&para;<br>1996 (AEDPA) authorizes a federal habeas court to grant&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>NEVADA v. JACKSON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>relief to a prisoner whose state court conviction “involved&para;<br>an unreasonable application of . . . clearly established&para;<br>Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the&para;<br>United States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). It is settled that&para;<br>a federal habeas court may overturn a state court’s application of federal law only if it is so erroneous that “there&para;<br>is no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the&para;<br>state court’s decision conflicts with this Court’s precedents.” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)&para;<br>(slip op., at 13). Applying that deferential standard, we&para;<br>conclude that the Nevada Supreme Court’s decision was&para;<br>reasonable.&para;<br>“[T]he Constitution guarantees criminal defendants ‘a&para;<br>meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense,’ ”&para;<br>Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 683, 690 (1986) (quoting&para;<br>California v. Trombetta, 467 U. S. 479, 485 (1984)), but&para;<br>we have also recognized that “ ‘state and federal rulemakers have broad latitude under the Constitution to establish&para;<br>rules excluding evidence from criminal trials,’ ” Holmes v.&para;<br>South Carolina, 547 U. S. 319, 324 (2006) (quoting United&para;<br>States v. Scheffer, 523 U. S. 303, 308 (1998)). Only rarely&para;<br>have we held that the right to present a complete defense&para;<br>was violated by the exclusion of defense evidence under a&para;<br>state rule of evidence. See 547 U. S., at 331 (rule did not&para;<br>rationally serve any discernible purpose); Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U. S. 44, 61 (1987) (rule arbitrary); Chambers v.&para;<br>Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284, 302–303 (1973) (State did not&para;<br>even attempt to explain the reason for its rule); Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14, 22 (1967) (rule could not be&para;<br>rationally defended).&para;<br>As the Ninth Circuit conceded, “[t]he Nevada Supreme&para;<br>Court recognized and applied the correct legal principle.”&para;<br>688 F. 3d, at 1097. But contrary to the Ninth Circuit’s&para;<br>conclusion, the State Supreme Court’s application of our&para;<br>clearly established precedents was reasonable. The starting point in the state court’s analysis was a state statute&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>that generally precludes the admission of extrinsic evidence of “[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a witness,&para;<br>for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness’&para;<br>credibility, other than conviction of crime.” App. to Pet.&para;<br>for Cert. 66; see Nev. Rev. Stat. §50.085(3) (2011). The&para;<br>purpose of that rule, the Nevada Supreme Court has&para;<br>explained, “is to focus the fact-finder on the most important facts and conserve ‘judicial resources by avoiding minitrials on collateral issues.’ ” Abbott v. State, 122 Nev.&para;<br>715, 736, 138 P. 3d 462, 476 (2006) (quoting State v. Long,&para;<br>140 S. W. 3d 27, 30 (Mo. 2004)). These are “good reason[s]” for limiting the use of extrinsic evidence, Clark v.&para;<br>Arizona, 548 U. S. 735, 770 (2006), and the Nevada statute&para;<br>is akin to the widely accepted rule of evidence law that&para;<br>generally precludes the admission of evidence of specific&para;<br>instances of a witness’ conduct to prove the witness’ character for untruthfulness. See Fed. Rule Evid. 608(b); C.&para;<br>Mueller &amp; L. Kirkpatrick, Evidence §6.27, pp. 497–499&para;<br>(4th ed. 2009). The constitutional propriety of this rule&para;<br>cannot be seriously disputed.&para;<br>As an exception to the prohibition contained in Nev.&para;<br>Rev. Stat. §50.085(3), the Nevada Supreme Court held in&para;<br>Miller v. State, 105 Nev. 497, 499–500, 779 P. 2d 87, 88–89&para;<br>(1989), that “in a sexual assault case defense counsel may&para;<br>cross-examine a complaining witness about previous fabricated sexual assault accusations and, if the witness&para;<br>denies making the allegations, may introduce extrinsic&para;<br>evidence to prove that fabricated charges were made by&para;<br>that witness in the past.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 66. But in&para;<br>order to introduce evidence showing that the witness&para;<br>previously made false allegations, the defendant must file&para;<br>written notice, and the trial court must hold a hearing.&para;<br>Miller, supra, at 501, 779 P. 2d, at 90. Respondent did not&para;<br>file the requisite notice, and the State Supreme Court&para;<br>upheld the exclusion of evidence of prior sexual assault&para;<br>complaints on this basis.&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>NEVADA v. JACKSON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>No decision of this Court clearly establishes that this&para;<br>notice requirement is unconstitutional. Nor, contrary to&para;<br>the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit majority, see 688 F.&para;<br>3d, at 1103–1104, do our cases clearly establish that the&para;<br>Constitution requires a case-by-case balancing of interests&para;<br>before such a rule can be enforced. The decision on which&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit relied, Michigan v. Lucas, 500 U. S. 145&para;<br>(1991), is very far afield. In that case, we reversed a&para;<br>decision holding that the Sixth Amendment categorically&para;<br>prohibits the enforcement of a rule that required a rape&para;<br>defendant to provide pretrial notice if he wished to introduce evidence of his prior sexual relationship with the&para;<br>complaining witness. The Court did not even suggest,&para;<br>much less hold, that it is unconstitutional to enforce such&para;<br>a rule unless a case-by-case balancing of interests weighs&para;<br>in favor of enforcement. Instead, the Court “express[ed]&para;<br>no opinion as to whether or not preclusion was justified in&para;<br>th[at] case” and left it for the state courts to address that&para;<br>question in the first instance. Id., at 153. No fair-minded&para;<br>jurist could think that Lucas clearly establishes that the&para;<br>enforcement of the Nevada rule in this case is inconsistent&para;<br>with the Constitution.&para;<br>Some of the evidence that respondent sought to introduce concerned prior incidents in which the victim reported that respondent beat her up but did not sexually&para;<br>assault her, and the state supreme court did not view its&para;<br>Miller decision as applying in such circumstances. But the&para;<br>state court did not simply invoke the rule set out in Nev.&para;<br>Rev. Stat. §50.085(3). Rather, the court reasoned that the&para;<br>proffered evidence had little impeachment value because&para;<br>at most it showed simply that the victim’s reports could&para;<br>not be corroborated. The admission of extrinsic evidence&para;<br>of specific instances of a witness’ conduct to impeach the&para;<br>witness’ credibility may confuse the jury, unfairly embarrass the victim, surprise the prosecution, and unduly&para;<br>prolong the trial. No decision of this Court clearly estab-&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>lishes that the exclusion of such evidence for such reasons&para;<br>in a particular case violates the Constitution.&para;<br>In holding that respondent is entitled to habeas relief,&para;<br>the Ninth Circuit pointed to two of its own AEDPA decisions in which it granted habeas relief to state prisoners&para;<br>who were not allowed to conduct a full cross-examination&para;<br>of the witnesses against them. 688 F. 3d, at 1098–1101&para;<br>(discussing Fowler v. Sacramento Cty. Sheriff ’s Dept., 421&para;<br>F. 3d 1027, 1035–1038 (CA9 2005) and Holley v. Yarborough, 568 F. 3d 1091, 1098–1101 (CA9 2009)). Those&para;<br>cases in turn relied on Supreme Court decisions holding&para;<br>that various restrictions on a defendant’s ability to crossexamine witnesses violate the Confrontation Clause of the&para;<br>Sixth Amendment. See, e.g., Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U. S.&para;<br>227, 231 (1988) (per curiam); Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475&para;<br>U. S. 673, 678–679 (1986); Davis v. Alaska, 415 U. S.&para;<br>308, 315–316 (1974). But this Court has never held that&para;<br>the Confrontation Clause entitles a criminal defendant to&para;<br>introduce extrinsic evidence for impeachment purposes.&para;<br>See Delaware v. Fensterer, 474 U. S. 15, 22 (1985)&para;<br>(per curiam) (observing that “the Confrontation Clause is&para;<br>generally satisfied when the defense is given a full and&para;<br>fair opportunity to . . . expose [testimonial] infirmities&para;<br>through cross-examination”). See also Jordan v. Warden,&para;<br>675 F. 3d 586, 596 (CA6 2012); Brown v. Ruane, 630 F. 3d&para;<br>62, 70 (CA1 2011).&para;<br>The Ninth Circuit elided the distinction between crossexamination and extrinsic evidence by characterizing the&para;<br>cases as recognizing a broad right to present “evidence&para;<br>bearing on [a witness’] credibility.” 688 F. 3d, at 1099. By&para;<br>framing our precedents at such a high level of generality,&para;<br>a lower federal court could transform even the most imaginative extension of existing case law into “clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.”&para;<br>28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). In thus collapsing the distinction&para;<br>between “an unreasonable application of federal law” and&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>NEVADA v. JACKSON&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>what a lower court believes to be “an incorrect or erroneous&para;<br>application of federal law,” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S.&para;<br>362, 412 (2000), the Ninth Circuit’s approach would defeat&para;<br>the substantial deference that AEDPA requires.&para;<br>The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent’s&para;<br>motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The&para;<br>judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the&para;<br>Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for&para;<br>further proceedings consistent with this opinion.&para;<br>It is so ordered.&para;<br>&para;<br></span>
