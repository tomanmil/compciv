ILLINOIS&para;<br>ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE&para;<br>&para;<br>SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS&para;<br>&para;<br>No. 13–5967. Decided May 27, 2014&para;<br>&para;<br>&para;<br>PER CURIAM.&para;<br>The trial of Esteban Martinez was set to begin on May&para;<br>17, 2010. His counsel was ready; the State was not. When&para;<br>the court swore in the jury and invited the State to pre­&para;<br>sent its first witness, the State declined to present any&para;<br>evidence. So Martinez moved for a directed not-guilty&para;<br>verdict, and the court granted it. The State appealed,&para;<br>arguing that the trial court should have granted its motion&para;<br>for a continuance. The question is whether the Double&para;<br>Jeopardy Clause bars the State’s attempt to appeal in the&para;<br>hope of subjecting Martinez to a new trial.&para;<br>The Illinois Supreme Court manifestly erred in allowing&para;<br>the State’s appeal, on the theory that jeopardy never&para;<br>attached because Martinez “was never at risk of convic­&para;<br>tion.” 2013 IL 113475, ¶39, 990 N. E. 2d 215, 224. Our&para;<br>cases have repeatedly stated the bright-line rule that&para;<br>“jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and&para;<br>sworn.” Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28, 35 (1978); see infra, at&para;<br>6. There is simply no doubt that Martinez was subjected&para;<br>to jeopardy. And because the trial court found the State’s&para;<br>evidence insufficient to sustain a conviction, there is&para;<br>equally no doubt that Martinez may not be retried.&para;<br>We therefore grant Martinez’s petition for certiorari and&para;<br>reverse the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court.&para;<br>I&para;<br>A&para;<br>The State of Illinois indicted Martinez in August 2006&para;<br>on charges of aggravated battery and mob action against&para;<br>&para;<br>2&para;<br>&para;<br>MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Avery Binion and Demarco Scott. But Martinez’s trial&para;<br>date did not arrive for nearly four years.1&para;<br>The story picks up for present purposes on July 20,&para;<br>2009, when the State moved to continue an August 3 trial&para;<br>date because it had not located the complaining witnesses,&para;<br>Binion and Scott. The State subpoenaed both men four&para;<br>days later, and the court rescheduled Martinez’s trial to&para;<br>September 28. But the State sought another continuance,&para;<br>shortly before that date, because it still had not found&para;<br>Binion and Scott. The court rescheduled the trial to No­&para;<br>vember 9, and the State reissued subpoenas. But Novem­&para;<br>ber 9 came and went (the court continued the case when&para;<br>Martinez showed up late) and the trial was eventually&para;<br>delayed to the following March 29. In early February, the&para;<br>State yet again subpoenaed Binion and Scott. When&para;<br>March 29 arrived, the trial court granted the State an­&para;<br>other continuance. It reset the trial date for May 17 and&para;<br>ordered Binion and Scott to appear in court on May 10.&para;<br>And the State once more issued subpoenas.2&para;<br>On the morning of May 17, however, Binion and Scott&para;<br>were again nowhere to be found. At 8:30, when the trial&para;<br>was set to begin, the State asked for a brief continuance.&para;<br>The court offered to delay swearing the jurors until a&para;<br>complete jury had been empaneled and told the State that&para;<br>it could at that point either have the jury sworn or move to&para;<br>dismiss its case. When Binion and Scott still had not&para;<br>shown up after the jury was chosen, the court offered to&para;<br>call the other cases on its docket so as to delay swearing&para;<br>the jury a bit longer. But when all these delays had run&para;<br>out, Binion and Scott were still nowhere in sight. The&para;<br>State filed a written motion for a continuance, arguing&para;<br>——————&para;<br>1 Much of that delay was due to Martinez and his counsel. See 2013&para;<br>IL 113475, ¶4, n. 1, 990 N. E. 2d 215, 216, n. 1 (summarizing the&para;<br>lengthy procedural history).&para;<br>2 These facts are set forth in the opinion of the Illinois Appellate&para;<br>Court. 2011 IL App (2d) 100498, ¶¶5–7, 969 N.

The court denied that motion:&para;<br>“The case before the Court began on July 7, 2006.&para;<br>In two months we will then be embarking upon half a&para;<br>decade of pending a Class 3 felony. Avery Binion, Jr.,&para;<br>and Demarco [Scott] are well known in Elgin, both are&para;<br>convicted felons. One would believe that the Elgin Po­&para;<br>lice Department would know their whereabouts. They&para;<br>were ordered to be in court today. The Court will is­&para;<br>sue body writs for both of these gentlemen.&para;<br>“In addition, the State’s list of witnesses indi­&para;<br>cates twelve witnesses. Excluding Mr. Scott and Mr.&para;<br>Binion, that’s ten witnesses. The Court would antici­&para;<br>pate it would take every bit of today and most of to­&para;<br>morrow to get through ten witnesses. By then the&para;<br>People may have had a chance to execute the arrest&para;<br>warrant body writs for these two gentlemen.&para;<br>“The Court will deny the motion for continuance. I&para;<br>will swear the jury in in 15, 20 minutes. Perhaps you&para;<br>might want to send the police out to find these two&para;<br>gentlemen.” Id., at 8–9.&para;<br>After a brief recess, the court offered to delay the start&para;<br>of the trial for several more hours if the continuance would&para;<br>“be of any help” to the State. Id., at 9. But when the State&para;<br>made clear that Binion and Scott’s “whereabouts” re­&para;<br>mained “unknown,” the court concluded that the delay&para;<br>“would be a further waste of time.” Id., at 10. The follow­&para;<br>ing colloquy ensued:&para;<br>“THE COURT: . . . . It’s a quarter to eleven and&para;<br>[Binion and Scott] have not appeared on their own&para;<br>will, so I’m going to bring the jury in now then to&para;<br>swear them.&para;<br>“[The Prosecutor]: Okay. Your Honor, may I ap­&para;<br>proach briefly?&para;<br>“THE COURT: Yes.&para;<br>&para;<br>4&para;<br>&para;<br>MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>“[The Prosecutor]: Your Honor, just so your Honor is&para;<br>aware, I know that it’s the process to bring them in&para;<br>and swear them in; however, the State will not be par­&para;<br>ticipating in the trial. I wanted to let you know that.&para;<br>“THE COURT: Very well. We’ll see how that&para;<br>works.” Id., at 10–11.&para;<br>The jury was then sworn. After instructing the jury, the&para;<br>court directed the State to proceed with its opening state­&para;<br>ment. The prosecutor demurred: “Your Honor, respect­&para;<br>fully, the State is not participating in this case.” Id., at&para;<br>20. After the defense waived its opening statement, the&para;<br>court directed the State to call its first witness. Again, the&para;<br>prosecutor demurred: “Respectfully, your Honor, the State&para;<br>is not participating in this matter.” Ibid. The defense&para;<br>then moved for a judgment of acquittal:&para;<br>“[Defense Counsel]: Judge, the jury has been sworn.&para;<br>The State has not presented any evidence. I believe&para;<br>they’ve indicated their intention not to present any ev­&para;<br>idence or witnesses.&para;<br>“Based on that, Judge, I would ask the Court to&para;<br>enter directed findings of not guilty to both counts, ag­&para;<br>gravated battery and mob action.&para;<br>“THE COURT: Do the People wish to reply?&para;<br>“[The Prosecutor]: No, your Honor. Respectfully,&para;<br>the State is not participating.&para;<br>“THE COURT: The Court will grant the motion for&para;<br>a directed finding and dismiss the charges.” Id., at 21.&para;<br>B&para;<br>The State appealed, arguing that the trial court should&para;<br>have granted a continuance. Martinez responded that the&para;<br>State’s appeal was improper because he had been acquit­&para;<br>ted. The Illinois Appellate Court sided with the State,&para;<br>holding that jeopardy had never attached and that the&para;<br>trial court had erred in failing to grant a continuance.&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>5&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>2011 IL App (2d) 100498, ¶¶46, 53–56, 969 N. E. 2d 840,&para;<br>854, 856–858.&para;<br>The Illinois Supreme Court granted review on the jeop­&para;<br>ardy issue and affirmed. 2013 IL 113475, 990 N. E. 2d&para;<br>215. It began by recognizing that “[g]enerally, in cases of&para;<br>a jury trial, jeopardy attaches when a jury is empaneled&para;<br>and sworn, as that is the point when the defendant is ‘ “put&para;<br>to trial before the trier of the facts.” ’ ” Id., ¶23, 990 N. E.&para;<br>2d, at 222 (quoting Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S. 377,&para;<br>394 (1975)). But it reasoned that under this Court’s prec­&para;<br>edents, “ ‘ “rigid, mechanical” rules’ ” should not govern the&para;<br>inquiry into whether jeopardy has attached. 2013 IL&para;<br>113475, ¶24, 990 N. E. 2d, at 222 (quoting Serfass, supra,&para;<br>at 390). Rather, it opined, the relevant question is whether&para;<br>a defendant “was ‘ “subjected to the hazards of trial and&para;<br>possible conviction.” ’ ” 2013 IL 113475, ¶24, 990 N. E. 2d,&para;<br>at 222 (quoting Serfass, supra, at 391).&para;<br>Here, the court concluded, Martinez “was never at risk&para;<br>of conviction”—and jeopardy therefore did not attach—&para;<br>because “[t]he State indicated it would not participate&para;<br>prior to the jury being sworn.” 2013 IL 113475, ¶39, 990&para;<br>N. E. 2d, at 224. And because Martinez “was not placed in&para;<br>jeopardy,” the court held, the trial “court’s entry of di­&para;<br>rected verdicts of not guilty did not constitute true acquit­&para;<br>tals.” Id., ¶40, 990 N. E. 2d, at 225. Indeed, the court&para;<br>remarked, the trial court “repeatedly referred to its action&para;<br>as a ‘dismissal’ rather than an acquittal.” Ibid.&para;<br>Justice Burke dissented, writing that the majority’s&para;<br>conclusion “that impaneling and swearing the jury had no&para;<br>legal significance” ran “contrary to well-established prin­&para;<br>ciples regarding double jeopardy.” Id., ¶57, 990 N. E. 2d,&para;<br>at 227. Moreover, she argued, its assertion that Martinez&para;<br>was not in danger of conviction was “belied by the actions&para;<br>of the court and the prosecutor.” Id., ¶63, 990 N. E. 2d, at&para;<br>229. She explained that under the majority’s holding, the&para;<br>State could “unilaterally render a trial a ‘sham’ simply by&para;<br>&para;<br>6&para;<br>&para;<br>MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>refusing to call witnesses after a jury has been selected.”&para;<br>Id., ¶64, 990 N. E. 2d, at 229.&para;<br>II&para;<br>This case presents two issues. First, did jeopardy attach&para;<br>to Martinez? Second, if so, did the proceeding end in such&para;<br>a manner that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars his retrial?&para;<br>Our precedents clearly dictate an affirmative answer&para;<br>to each question.&para;<br>A&para;<br>There are few if any rules of criminal procedure clearer&para;<br>than the rule that “jeopardy attaches when the jury is&para;<br>empaneled and sworn.” Crist, 437 U. S., at 35; see also&para;<br>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564,&para;<br>569 (1977); Serfass, supra, at 388; 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel,&para;<br>N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §25.1(d) (3d ed.&para;<br>2007).&para;<br>Our clearest exposition of this rule came in Crist, which&para;<br>addressed the constitutionality of a Montana statute&para;<br>providing that jeopardy did not attach until the swearing&para;<br>of the first witness. As Crist explains, “the precise point at&para;<br>which jeopardy [attaches] in a jury trial might have been&para;<br>open to argument before this Court’s decision in Downum&para;<br>v. United States, 372 U. S. 734 [(1963)],” in which “the&para;<br>Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented a&para;<br>second prosecution of a defendant whose first trial had&para;<br>ended just after the jury had been sworn and before any&para;<br>testimony had been taken.” 437 U. S., at 35. But&para;<br>Downum put any such argument to rest: Its holding “nec­&para;<br>essarily pinpointed the stage in a jury trial when jeopardy&para;<br>attaches, and [it] has since been understood as explicit&para;<br>authority for the proposition that jeopardy attaches when&para;<br>the jury is empaneled and sworn.” Crist, supra, at 35.&para;<br>The Illinois Supreme Court misread our precedents in&para;<br>suggesting that the swearing of the jury is anything other&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>7&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>than a bright line at which jeopardy attaches. It relied on&para;<br>Serfass, understanding that case to mean “that in as­&para;<br>sessing whether and when jeopardy attaches, ‘ “rigid,&para;<br>mechanical” rules’ should not be applied.”&para;<br>2013 IL&para;<br>113475, ¶24, 990 N. E. 2d, at 222. Under Serfass, the&para;<br>court reasoned, the relevant question is whether a defend­&para;<br>ant was as a functional matter “ ‘ “subjected to the hazards&para;<br>of trial and possible conviction.” ’ ” 2013 IL 113475, ¶24,&para;<br>990 N. E. 2d, at 222.&para;<br>But Serfass does not apply a functional approach to the&para;<br>determination of when jeopardy has attached. As to that&para;<br>question, it states the same bright-line rule as every other&para;<br>case: Jeopardy attaches when “a defendant is ‘put to trial,’ ”&para;<br>and in a jury trial, that is “when a jury is empaneled&para;<br>and sworn.” 420 U. S., at 388. Indeed, Serfass explicitly&para;<br>rejects a functional approach to the question whether&para;<br>jeopardy has attached. See id., at 390 (refuting the de­&para;<br>fendant’s argument that “ ‘constructiv[e] jeopardy had&para;<br>attached’ ” upon the pretrial grant of a motion to dismiss&para;<br>the indictment, which the defendant characterized as “the&para;<br>‘functional equivalent of an acquittal on the merits’ ”). The&para;<br>Serfass Court acknowledged “that we have disparaged&para;<br>‘rigid, mechanical’ rules in the interpretation of the Double&para;<br>Jeopardy Clause.” Ibid. But it was referring to the case of&para;<br>Illinois v. Somerville, 410 U. S. 458 (1973), in which we&para;<br>declined to apply “rigid, mechanical” reasoning in answer­&para;<br>ing a very different question: not whether jeopardy had&para;<br>attached, but whether the manner in which it terminated&para;<br>(by mistrial) barred the defendant’s retrial. Id., at 467.&para;<br>By contrast, Serfass explains, the rule that jeopardy at­&para;<br>taches at the start of a trial is “by no means a mere tech­&para;<br>nicality, nor is it a ‘rigid, mechanical’ rule.” 420 U. S., at&para;<br>391. And contrary to the Illinois Supreme Court’s inter­&para;<br>pretation, Serfass creates not the slightest doubt about&para;<br>when a “trial” begins.&para;<br>The Illinois Supreme Court’s error was consequential,&para;<br>&para;<br>8&para;<br>&para;<br>MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>for it introduced confusion into what we have consistently&para;<br>treated as a bright-line rule: A jury trial begins, and jeop­&para;<br>ardy attaches, when the jury is sworn. We have never&para;<br>suggested the exception perceived by the Illinois Supreme&para;<br>Court—that jeopardy may not have attached where, under&para;<br>the circumstances of a particular case, the defendant was&para;<br>not genuinely at risk of conviction.3 Martinez was subjected&para;<br>to jeopardy because the jury in his case was sworn.&para;<br>B&para;<br>“ ‘[T]he conclusion that jeopardy has attached,’ ” how­&para;<br>ever, “ ‘begins, rather than ends, the inquiry as to whether&para;<br>the Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial.’ ” Id., at 390.&para;<br>The remaining question is whether the jeopardy ended in&para;<br>such a manner that the defendant may not be retried. See&para;<br>6 LaFave §25.1(g) (surveying circumstances in which&para;<br>retrial is and is not allowed). Here, there is no doubt that&para;<br>Martinez’s jeopardy ended in a manner that bars his&para;<br>retrial: The trial court acquitted him of the charged of­&para;<br>fenses. “Perhaps the most fundamental rule in the history&para;<br>of double jeopardy jurisprudence has been that ‘[a] verdict&para;<br>of acquittal . . . could not be reviewed . . . without putting&para;<br>[a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the&para;<br>Constitution.’ ” Martin Linen, supra, at 571.&para;<br>“[O]ur cases have defined an acquittal to encompass any&para;<br>ruling that the prosecution’s proof is insufficient to estab­&para;<br>lish criminal liability for an offense.” Evans v. Michigan,&para;<br>568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4–5). And the trial&para;<br>——————&para;<br>3 Some commentators have suggested that there may be limited ex­&para;<br>ceptions to this rule—e.g., where the trial court lacks jurisdiction or&para;<br>where a defendant obtains an acquittal by fraud or corruption. See 6&para;<br>W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §25.1(d)&para;<br>(3d ed. 2007). The scope of any such exceptions is not presented here.&para;<br>Nor need we reach a situation where the prosecutor had no opportunity&para;<br>to dismiss the charges to avoid the consequences of empaneling the&para;<br>jury. Cf. People v. Deems, 81 Ill. 2d 384, 387–389, 410 N. E. 2d 8, 10–11&para;<br>(1980).&para;<br>&para;<br>Cite as: 572 U. S. ____ (2014)&para;<br>&para;<br>9&para;<br>&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>court clearly made such a ruling here. After the State&para;<br>declined to present evidence against Martinez, his counsel&para;<br>moved for “directed findings of not guilty to both counts,”&para;<br>and the court “grant[ed] the motion for a directed finding.”&para;<br>Tr. 21. That is a textbook acquittal: a finding that the&para;<br>State’s evidence cannot support a conviction.&para;<br>The Illinois Supreme Court thought otherwise. It first&para;<br>opined that “[b]ecause [Martinez] was not placed in jeop­&para;<br>ardy, the [trial] court’s entry of directed verdicts of not&para;<br>guilty did not constitute true acquittals.” 2013 IL 113475,&para;<br>¶40, 990 N. E. 2d, at 225. But the premise of that argu­&para;<br>ment is incorrect: Martinez was in jeopardy, for the rea­&para;<br>sons given above. The court went on to “note that, in&para;<br>directing findings of not guilty,” the trial court “referred to&para;<br>its action as a ‘dismissal’ rather than an acquittal.” Ibid.&para;<br>Under our precedents, however, that is immaterial: “[W]e&para;<br>have emphasized that what constitutes an ‘acquittal’ is&para;<br>not to be controlled by the form of the judge’s action”; it&para;<br>turns on “whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its&para;<br>label, actually represents a resolution . . . of some or all of&para;<br>the factual elements of the offense charged.” Martin&para;<br>Linen, 430 U. S., at 571; see also Evans, supra, at ___ (slip&para;<br>op., at 11) (“Our decision turns not on the form of the trial&para;<br>court’s action, but rather whether it ‘serve[s]’ substantive&para;<br>‘purposes’ or procedural ones”); United States v. Scott, 437&para;<br>U. S. 82, 96 (1978) (“We have previously noted that ‘the&para;<br>trial judge’s characterization of his own action cannot&para;<br>control the classification of the action’ ”).&para;<br>Here, as in Evans and Martin Linen, the trial court’s&para;<br>action was an acquittal because the court “acted on its&para;<br>view that the prosecution had failed to prove its case.”&para;<br>Evans, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11); see Martin Linen,&para;<br>supra, at 572 (“[T]he District Court in this case evaluated&para;<br>the Government’s evidence and determined that it was&para;<br>legally insufficient to sustain a conviction”). And because&para;<br>&para;<br>10&para;<br>&para;<br>MARTINEZ v. ILLINOIS&para;<br>Per Curiam&para;<br>&para;<br>Martinez was acquitted, the State cannot retry him.4&para;<br>III&para;<br>The functional rule adopted by the Illinois Supreme&para;<br>Court is not necessary to avoid unfairness to prosecutors&para;<br>or to the public. On the day of trial, the court was acutely&para;<br>aware of the significance of swearing a jury. It repeatedly&para;<br>delayed that act to give the State additional time to find&para;<br>its witnesses. It had previously granted the State a num­&para;<br>ber of continuances for the same purpose. See supra, at 2.&para;<br>And, critically, the court told the State on the day of trial&para;<br>that it could “move to dismiss [its] case” before the jury&para;<br>was sworn. Tr. 3. Had the State accepted that invitation,&para;<br>the Double Jeopardy Clause would not have barred it from&para;<br>recharging Martinez. Instead, the State participated in&para;<br>the selection of jurors and did not ask for dismissal before&para;<br>the jury was sworn. When the State declined to dismiss&para;<br>its case, it “ ‘took a chance[,] . . . enter[ing] upon the trial of&para;<br>the case without sufficient evidence to convict.’ ” Downum&para;<br>v. United States, 372 U. S. 734, 737 (1963). Here, the&para;<br>State knew, or should have known, that an acquittal&para;<br>forever bars the retrial of the defendant when it occurs&para;<br>after jeopardy has attached. The Illinois Supreme Court’s&para;<br>holding is understandable, given the significant conse­&para;<br>quence of the State’s mistake, but it runs directly counter&para;<br>to our precedents and to the protection conferred by the&para;<br>Double Jeopardy Clause.&para;<br>——————&para;<br>4 Indeed, even if the trial court had chosen to dismiss the case or de­&para;<br>clare a mistrial rather than granting Martinez’s motion for a directed&para;<br>verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause probably would still bar his retrial.&para;<br>We confronted precisely this scenario in Downum v. United States, 372&para;<br>U. S. 734 (1963), holding that once jeopardy has attached, the absence&para;<br>of witnesses generally does not constitute the kind of “ ‘extraordinary&para;<br>and striking circumstanc[e]’ ” in which a trial court may exercise&para;<br>“discretion to discharge the jury before it has reached a verdict.” Id., at&para;<br>736; see also Arizona v.
